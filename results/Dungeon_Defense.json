This maiden does not believe in superstitions.”</p><p>“What a shame. Superstitions are quite grand. They give invigoration to one’s life.”</p><p>The surrounding was silent.</p><p>The crowd of five thousand silently listened to the conversation between the two people before them.</p><p>On one side stood a radiantly beautiful woman. While she was a noble who governed this city, she was also the one to have been defeated in&nbsp;this siege.</p><p>On the other side sat a dark man. Wrapped in a black cloak and dressed up in similarly black clothing, he could only be described as a person of darkness. Peculiarly, he was plucking the petals of a flower. Petal by petal, the rose was plucked apart and fell to the floor with an ominous feeling.</p><p>“Thou had the opportunity to surrender before.”</p><p>“I admit this.”</p><p>“Four times.”</p><p>The man spoke.</p><p>“I had dispatched an envoy presenting thee the opportunity to surrender, four times. However, each time, thou had slit the throat of the envoy and sent back the corpse. Seeing how it has already come to this, let us speak&nbsp;truthfully. I desire to&nbsp;behead thy beautiful head and display it on a spear.”</p><p>The man muttered nonchalantly. If you were listening&nbsp;from an outside perspective, the way he spoke that last sentence was like as if he was simply commenting about how nice the weather was.</p><p>In spite of that, if you were to look even slightly to the side you would learn how wrong that feeling was. From goblins to orcs and to finally ogres, these bulky monsters were guarding the man without leaving even a single gap. These monsters could slaughter the five thousand humans gathered here immediately if the man so ordered them to.</p><p>‘… For such a normal looking man to give off such intimidating force.’</p><p>The noble woman could only gulp. The responsibility to protect the lives of the citizens were resting on her shoulders.</p><p>‘To want to put my neck on a spear. Is he speaking the truth or is he threatening me? Or perhaps he’s simply testing me…’</p><p>Christiane Louise Von Volfusbrook.</p><p>A heroine known as the ‘Northern Pearl’ of the Empire.</p><p>She had started a rebellion in the demon lord’s army. It had been about half a year since the Empire was invaded by the demons and there were humans that had still not completely accepted being ruled by monsters. It was thought that there was a considerably high chance of succeeding this revolution.</p><p>But the man before her reacted before anyone else.</p><p>In a matter of days, contact between other cities were cut, supply routes were plundered, and fortresses were captured. Once she was able to finally collect herself, her city had already fallen in only four months.</p><p>‘So this is a Demon Lord…”</p><p>Christiane Louise bit her lips strongly.</p><p>만마(萬魔)를 호령하는 일흔두 좌의 일원.</p><p>거짓된 연금술과 모든 수사학을 관장하는 주인.</p><p>연극배우 중의 연극배우.</p><p>가로되 이면(異面)의 마왕이라 칭송받는 자.</p><p>A member in an order of 72, who rules over 10,000 demons.</p><p>The lord&nbsp;managing false alchemy and all rhetoric.</p><p>Actor among actors.</p><p>Praised as a Demon Lord of many faces.</p><p>(TL note: I honestly have no idea what they mean by the second line, and I’m a bit iffy about the fourth line’s translations)</p><p>Dantalian.</p><p>Demon Lord Dantalian.</p><p>That was this man’s name.</p><p>Christiane Louise shuddered in terror.</p><p>‘One wrong move and I’ll be killed…!’</p><p>In order to calm her shaking knees, Christiane Louise thought of her father’s dying words. ‘Always be dignified’. That was right. Now was the time to behave like a noble and respond resolutely.</p><p>‘I could sell my body if necessary.’</p><p>The rumor that the demon lord in front of her was a sex fiend was already wide-spread.</p><p>Although she wasn’t trying to brag, Christiane Louise was quite confident in her own appearance.</p><p>If need be, she’d become a sex slave if it meant to protect her family(‘s name).</p><p>Christiane Louise had made up her mind.</p><p>“Oh great Demon Lord-”</p><p>“Sorry, but could you not call me that?”</p><p>The man cut her off, showing clear detest.</p><p>“What do you mean by, ‘Oh great Demon Lord’. I feel so nauseous just hearing those words, that&nbsp;I wouldn’t be surprised if my ears were to melt off this very instant. There’s over fifty Demon Lords roaming this continent alone. I wonder if I’m the only ‘great Demon Lord’.”</p><p>“Then, what should this one call your highness by.…&nbsp;…?”</p><p>“Just stick with ‘your highness’.”</p><p>Christiane Louise nodded in response.</p><p>“Yes, your highness. May I humbly inform your highness&nbsp;that there are three reasons to spare this one’s life?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Is that so? Tell me only one.”</p><p>The man plucked a petal and let the single red petal descend slowly.</p><p>“I do not have that much patience.”</p><p>“…!”</p><p>A chill went down Christiane Louise’s spine. The man was not even looking at her, and yet it felt as if hundreds of invisible floating eyes were staring down at her.</p><p>‘I-I must be hallucinating.’</p><p>The inside of Christiane Louise’s mouth became dry.</p><p>‘It’s nothing more than my mind playing tricks on me.’</p><p>She muttered in her mind the wise saying passed down the generations of her household.</p><p><em>‘Oh ancestors. Do not respect injustice because of growth, and do not ignore justice because of youth.’</em></p><p>Like a traveler walking down a dark mountain path whilst relying on a poorly made torch, Christiane Louise was just barely able to muster up the courage to open her mouth by depending on the pride of her family.</p><p>“… There are six cities remaining that are still supporting the rebellion. It is obvious that it’ll take an immense amount of time and manpower to conquer them all.”</p><p>The man raised his shoulders.</p><p>“Indeed. I’ve been getting the urge to commit suicide just thinking about that.”</p><p>“Your highness. Gain control of them not with spears but with generosity. If your highness shows tolerance and forgives us here, those other cities&nbsp;will naturally submit on their own. However, if your highness treats us with cruelty…”</p><p>“In fear of being treated the same, they’ll rebel&nbsp;more violently.”</p><p>The man cuts her off.</p><p>“Is that what you mean to say?”</p><p>“Yes, your highness.”</p><p>As expected, he understood quickly.</p><p>Christiane Louise could see a small glimpse of hope.</p><p>The man in front of her wasn’t simply a tyrannical Demon Lord. He was one of the more knowledgeable type. In short, words got through to him. The chance to stay alive might not be a hope in vain after all. Christiane Louise settled her fears.</p><div></div><p>The silence continued.</p><p>After plucking a rose bare the man picked up another. Without saying a single word, he tore the entire flower off the stem. The red petals scattered like snow, falling slowly into a pile at the man’s feet.</p><p>“—strip.”</p><p>A single word settled down over&nbsp;the surrounding.</p><p>It was an incredibly normal tone. Christiane Louise could not understand the situation. She could only blink in surprise.</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/xcqoevp.jpg?w=700\"><em>(TL note: I can’t find any scanned version of these illustrations, so you guys will have to make do with the pictures from my phone)</em>&nbsp;“Baroness Von Volfusbrook. Thou had started a rebellion on thou own stubbornness. As a result, two thousand citizens lost their lives. Of course, they were not my people. Be it two thousand or twenty thousand, it is not of my concern. But…&nbsp;…”</p><p>The man raised his head slowly.</p><p>Christiane could see the man’s eyes for the first time.</p><p>It was as if pure black pupils were piercing into the deepest depths of her heart.</p><p>“…not thou. All two thousand who had perished were thy people. In all of the continent, the only one who can take responsibility for all these lives is thee.”</p><p>The man sighed.</p><p>“A few minutes ago thou&nbsp;appealed to me to spare thy own life. Thou was not supposed to do&nbsp;that. Not for thy own life, but for the lives of all the people over there. Thou was&nbsp;supposed to plea to spare the lives of thy people. That is how a person takes responsibility.”</p><p>“Y-Your highness. This one was……”</p><p>“Baroness Christiane Louise Von Volfusbrook. Thou are a kind and beautiful woman. To be more precise, a devilish person. I sentence thee a disgraceful death.”</p><p>The man stood from his seat.</p><p>At once all of the monsters that were surrounding the area raised their weapons. The citizens became struck by fear and broke out into screams.</p><p>Upon these people the Demon Lord’s grave verdict fell.</p><p>“Thou shall be stripped and humiliated by my soldiers. In front of all these civilians, at that. I, Dantalian, rank 71st and possessing the name of different faces이면(異面), shall hereby sentence; Christiane Louise shall be deprived of her title as a noble and face death as a mere commoner.”</p><p>“Your highness……!?”</p><p>“Many lives shall come to an end here. Despair as I place the name of the one who pointlessly wasted the lives of others at the very bottom of my heart.”</p><p>The man left the stage indifferently.</p><p>The sudden movement of the man’s cloak caused a small gust on the floor, forcing the rose petals that had finally settled down to be scattered by the wind. From behind, Christiane Louise continued to shout. “Your highness!”, however, the man never turned back.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>This day, the woman known as the ‘Northern Pearl’ was executed.</p><p>Once again, the continent had to repeat the name of the Demon Lord, Dantalian.</p><h4>▯<strong>Demon Lord of Different Faces, Rank 71st, Dantalian</strong></h4><p>How did it become like this.</p><p>Damn it. This was not how I planned it!</p><p>Christiane Louise appeared as a heroine in the game as well. Her role was to assist the protagonist, who was the hero, in political affairs. The ending where you are able to overcome the social gap between each other and finally score in marrying Christiane was considerably loved by fans. Obviously, I was one of those fans.</p><p>If possible, I wanted to spare her.</p><p>Seeing her in real life, she was much prettier than her illustrations in the game.</p><p>My god. It was as if a goddess had descended from the Heavens.</p><p>In concern of being affected by her beauty, I had kept my head down. The only reason I continued to pluck roses was to hide my trembling emotions as well……</p><p>[1. Execute]</p><p>[2. Spare]</p><p>As per usual, whenever an important decision approached a choice box would rise up. A transparent box visible to only my eyes. Of course, I tried to select choice number 2 to spare them.</p><p>But as the conversation progressed, the mood got stranger and stranger.</p><p>Even if you’re being shameless, how can one have this little shame.</p><p>Two thousand people had died. Two thousand. Despite the fact that a strange choice box would appear and a stat window shined&nbsp;in front of my eyes, this was nonetheless the cruel reality. In this reality, two thousand people died because of one person’s ambition.</p><p>There wasn’t even a slightest bit of guilt in Christiane Louise’s attitude.</p><p>My mood started to get cold. The excitement I felt when I first met in person the heroine that I’ve only seen through the computer monitor&nbsp;until now, quickly subsided. Once I came to&nbsp;—I found myself ordering for the most disgraceful execution.</p><p>I did it again.</p><p>I let out a small sigh and spoke to a subordinate.</p><p>“Return to the grounds and behead the prisoners.”</p><p>“Yes? Should we not make them suffer more?”</p><p>“That’s enough. This is enough of an example for the other cities.”</p><p>The subordinate received the order and walked back to the grounds.</p><p>Shortly after.</p><p><strong>[1. Execute]</strong></p><p>[2. Spare]</p><p>The writings shined brightly in mid-air.</p><p>The words then broke apart into white particles and drifted. Although it felt they would disappear in any second, the particles abruptly moved together to form new words.</p><p><strong>[A cruel and&nbsp;merciless&nbsp;decision!]</strong></p><p><strong>[The continent is frightened by your ruthlessness.]</strong></p><p><strong>[Infamy increased substantially.]</strong></p><p>Then the words dispersed like petals.</p><p>The information that my infamy rose again put me further into depression.</p><p>“How did it turn out like this.”</p><p>I could only ask myself.</p><p>This wasn’t it.</p><p>Main point, I wanted to live a quiet life.</p><p>Where did things go wrong. Surely my birth itself wasn’t a mistake, right? Is that it?&nbsp;Life was irrational from the very start……</p><p>Aah, I wanted to rub{(부비부비)boobiboobi} against Christiane.</p><p>Not only Christiane, but I wanted to enjoy a fun life with the other heroines like Romei or the Emperor’s daughter, Elizabeth.</p><p>Truth be told, I don’t want to work at all.</p><p>Seriously, why did I have to end up possessing a Demon Lord’s body.</p><p>Anyone is okay. Please, someone fix my broken life……</p><p>Or at least give me a one month vacation……!</p>"

      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><h4><strong>Chapter One: 2 Years Ago</strong></h4><p>Speaking straightforward, my life was already over.</p><p>If there was one thing to talk about in this life that had already ended, then that would be my father. My father was truly&nbsp;a trash like man.</p><p>There was a time where my father got drunk and harassed a girl. A female high school student at that. Even though I was dumbfounded, since it was my father, I knew that it was more than likely to happen.</p><p>“If you had to sexually harass someone, did you have to choose a female high schooler?”</p><p>“Girls these days sure are developing quite splendidly.”</p><p>That was the response I got when I went to meet him.</p><p>Let me correct myself.</p><p>My father wasn’t just trash, but food waste.</p><p>“That girl is younger than me by 5 years.”</p><p>“Only by 5 years? Are you perhaps still in college?”</p><p>My father narrowed his brows.</p><p>His expression was incredibly serious.</p><p>“I thought you were about 41 years old.”</p><p>“If you look at me properly you’d know that I have a childlike face.”</p><p>“Bahaha! Don’t make me laugh. You’ve had a mustache since&nbsp;you were just an infant.”</p><p>If only killing intent could actually kill.</p><p>My father’s expression shifted and gave me a worried glance.</p><p>“Is your mother really upset?”</p><p>“Which mother?”</p><p>I gave him a slight temper.</p><p>“There are&nbsp;<strong>at least</strong>&nbsp;4 people I can call mother. I’m not really sure which one you’re referring to.”</p><p>“I’m talking about&nbsp;<strong>your</strong>&nbsp;mother.”</p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p>I’ll say this now.</p><p>Harem is a crime.</p><p>It wasn’t enough to make a bunch of lovers, but to also have a child here and there as well, that was inexcusably the worst.</p><p>The person concerned may be fine.</p><p>But in the position of the child, I wanted to kill myself.</p><p>Even after the age of forty, the mothers continued the bloody competition and feud over my father. My father was constantly indecisive and never made a choice.</p><p>As a result, the ones to come to harm were the children. The only ones dying in the struggle between mothers were innocent little us.</p><p>‘If you were smarter then wouldn’t your father pay more attention to me! You have to get first place in your whole school no matter what!’</p><p>Do you understand how it feels to hear this kind of thing every single day. Circumstances for me were a bit better though since I was male. My little sisters were really pitiful. In order to gain even a little bit more affection, they had to flatter him each and every time they could.</p><p>In the position of myself who had to watch all this happen, my impression of my own father was the worst. The chances of something good about my father coming out of my own mouth would be asking for the impossible.</p><p>“Listen carefully. I’m going to tell you slowly and exactly what you should do from here on out. Nothing bad has come from listening to my advice before, right?”</p><p>“Naturally. I’m ready to listen carefully to whatever you have to say.”</p><p>“Then first, do your best to try to stay in prison for as long as possible and&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>come out.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>My father furrowed his brows.</p><p>“That’s a bit different direction of advice I was hoping for.”</p><p>“Do not come out of prison and just stay there forever. Until you die. If the word ‘dismissal’ starts to float around or something, do not latch onto it. End your regret filled life in a cell.”</p><p>“I’ve never doubted that my son was dutiful up until now, but I’m starting to have my suspicions. Son. Is that really the best option?”</p><p>“My mother is trying to kill you.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>My father tilted his head.</p><p>“Are you saying that she’s angry enough to might kill me?”</p><p>“No. I mean exactly what I said. She is trying to kill you.”</p><p>“Korean is quite hard—. It’s difficult to understand—.”</p><p>“According to the Standard Korean Language Dictionary made by the National Language Department, the verb ‘kill’ has eleven meanings. Amongst those I’m using the first meaning; my mother is really trying to kill you.”</p><p>“Can I ask what the definition for the first meaning is?”</p><p>“To cease or end another one’s life.”</p><p>“It was a life without any hopes or dreams……”</p><p>My father pressed his head into his hands.</p><p>He had finally grasped the seriousness of the situation.</p><p>“You’ve been calling my mother by some weird word like ‘tsundere’ for a long time now, but I’ll tell you this now. My mother is a ‘yandere’. Resent yourself for marrying someone you most shouldn’t have while also having multiple wives.”</p><p>“But when she looked at me with those bloodthirsty eyes my body would tingle…… That’s your mother’s charm!”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Be great if you just died already.”</p><p>I muttered unintentionally.</p><p>I do not believe in God. There’s only one reason for that. If God really existed then the man in front of me would have been smited long time ago. My father was a Satanic person, an infectious germ that turned the people around him into atheists. I called it the ‘Human Trash Virus’.</p><p>“I didn’t know she was a high schooler in the first place. No, I groped that person’s butt not even knowing it was female. It’s unfair.”</p><p>“Then you lifted that skirt thinking it was a man? Congratulations. It’s fortunate that you were finally able to discover your actual sexual preference at that late of age. If you had realized 25 years sooner&nbsp;then the world could have been more peaceful, families could have been more tranquil, and my life could have been smoother.”</p><p>“I had 7 bottles of soju so I wasn’t sane.”</p><p>“Are you ever sane?”</p><p>I stood up from the seat.</p><p>I spoke while sullenly looking down at my father.</p><p>“Never bring up alcohol while in court. If they put that into consideration then your sentence will most likely be shortened. The day you leave prison, my mother will be waiting for you with a knife.”</p><p>“My beloved son……”</p><p>“Yes? Go ahead and speak, my not beloved father.”</p><p>“You must make good choices in life.”</p><p>I snorted.</p><p>“When you’re the one saying that, that sounds incredibly persuasive.”</p><p>“Right?”</p><p>“I’ll come visit whenever I have the time so make sure to behave.”</p><p>No matter who saw, my father was a failure of a husband.</p><p>There was no room for sympathy.</p><p>However, he was not a failure as a parent. Starting from me, my 6 siblings and I all were able to live wealthy lives. This was an incredible achievement. Also, while a person lives their life, be it as a husband or a parent, as long as they are successful in even one category I think they’re admirable. This way of thought still has not changed.</p><p><strong>Stay in prison forever.</strong></p><p>My father gladly listened to my last advice.</p><p>In the end, it became so.</p><p>Four days later, my father had passed away because of a heart attack.</p><p>♦</p><p>“I’m completely exhausted……”</p><p>After sorting out my boxes and furniture, I lied on my bed.</p><p>For the last month I had faced Hell. This was not a joke. If a demon could have seen my unsightly and miserable figure, then even they would have felt so much sympathy for me that they’d end up ascending as an angel.</p><p>I folded my fingers down one by one.</p><p>“The funeral is over. Set all the real estate in order. Passed over the foundation……”</p><p>I roughly threw away everything I needed to throw away from life.</p><p>Give up on the inheritance.</p><p>As soon as my father passed away I had dropped this bombshell.</p><p>My mother fainted and my half siblings made a commotion. My second half little sister was especially terrible. She clung onto me until my pants tore. However, my will was as firm as the snow piled at the very top of the Himalaya Mountains. If you want to break my stubbornness then you need to forward global warming by 600 years. Unfortunately, my mothers and siblings did not have the capability to immediately raise the carbon dioxide exhaust quantity around the world by seventy times the current amount at that time.</p><p>‘If brother retires, we’ll all be ruined!’</p><p>‘Big brother is a stupid idiot!’</p><p>‘I’m never contacting you again!’</p><p>Finally, once my second half little sister gave up, I escaped.</p><p>Phew.</p><p>A smile of satisfaction floated on my face.</p><p>To live the rest of one’s life is to live free from worldly cares. There’s no point in pretending to be something you’re not and buying things like a high noble. I’m too busy to go crazy and spend money on everything. While a few of my siblings were pleased that they had become the head of a company at such a young age, my second half little sister followed up with the statement— ‘Even if we end up ripping his<em>(brother’s)</em>&nbsp;ear off, we can’t let him go! Our household will be ruined within 6 years without him!’,—which I felt strongly for because I knew she was right.</p><p>“Okay. I’ve dealt with everything. I’m truly free now……!”</p><p>Thank you, father.</p><p>For passing away at an appropriate time.</p><p>This honest feeling may be an incredibly undutiful and immoral statement to say to one’s parent and it shakes my conscience by 1 mg, but if you consider the large amount of crap that my father had left behind on my life, the already little amount of conscience that remained seems to have vanished on its own.</p><p>I will never forget the moment he used his own son as a shield in order to avoid the knife being swung by my mother (a painful mid-summer memory from my second year of elementary school), even if I die.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>All things considered, I’ve already won the game of life.</p><p>Currently, in my bank account, was the large sum of over five hundred million won<em>(TL note: about 425,000$).</em></p><p>Just because I gave up on the inheritance doesn’t mean I didn’t fill my back pockets. I can enjoy the remainder of my life without having to ever work.</p><p>Yup.</p><p>Not the entirety of my&nbsp;life, but what remains.</p><p>I do not mean the definition&nbsp;to keep on living, but simply the meaning of what’s left. I purely desired for only this.</p><p>I got up from my bed and with a brush I wrote in large writing on a piece of parchment.</p><p>For the next 50 years, this will be the terms that’ll lead me for the remainder of my life.</p><p><strong>┌ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;┐&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;1.

Do not get married.</strong></p><p><strong>└ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ┘</strong></p><p>“……Beautiful.”</p><p>I was moved by my own writing.</p><p>I wonder if when Pythagoras discovered the law of mathematics, he was as deeply touched as I am now.</p><p>First, do not work.</p><p>This was stupidly obvious.</p><p>I’ve heard that there are some people in the world who enjoyed fruits of labor in their life. Thankfully, I’m not one of those perverted masochist.</p><p>Second, do not make friends.</p><p>This was also obvious.</p><p>There are only backstabbers and potential backstabbers in the world. Friendship is merely a vain dream, a virtual image, a fantasy. I won’t take any counterarguments.</p><p>Third, do not get married.</p><p>–This was important.</p><p>My father had relations with five women. After having watched a live romance drama starring 6 people since I was a mere child, I’ve come to a grave and serious conclusion.</p><p>Marriage is an insane act.</p><p>Something like true love are all bull crap lies.</p><p>Love is merely a way of murder that has become surprisingly gentler. As a result, it’s possessive desire and sexual desire.</p><div></div><p>Of course, grown up members of society might have a different opinion than I. That’s okay. Be satisfied with your bright and beautiful marriage life. However, if maybe, just maybe, you end up separating from your partner……compared to your marriage life, so much more beautiful days will lie&nbsp;ahead of you. I’ll guarantee it. You have my word. For starters, the dangers of being stabbed by a knife disappears. This alone already seems like a huge benefit, don’t you think?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>I’m a pessimistic human.</p><p>I wasn’t like this from the very beginning. Believe me.</p><p>Originally, I was highly positive. The world was beautiful and the righteousness in my chest flopped around like a just caught mackerel. To be specific, I was like this until a month ago. However, after having witnessed my mothers do a 1:1:1:1 deathmatch in the middle of the funeral, I politely recycled my hopes and dreams into the trash.</p><p>That’s so. This world is tragic. Even if you’re vexed, what can you do. This is the truth. The carbon dioxide exhaust rate won’t go down, China will grasp capital over the entire world, Justin Bieber will receive the Nobel Prize in literature……, and in 122 years you’ll be dead, I’ll be dead, we’ll all be dead.&nbsp;<em>(TL note: Yes, the author really does mention Justin Bieber.)</em></p><p>Oh, I’ll also tell you just in case; that adorable pet of yours will get hit by the front wheel of a bicycle and die…… I’m sorry to tell you the news, but what can you do? This is the truth.</p><p>If you’re done being sad then drink a beer.</p><p>To start off my carefree life, I went to the convenience store and bought 60 cans of beer.</p><p>The part-timer at the convenience store gave me a look as if asking ‘Excuse me, it’s not of my concern but is your life okay like this?’. I thanked the girl’s deep consideration and coolly swiped my card.</p><p>So what.</p><p>My card has damn five hundred million won. Five hundred million won is strong!</p><p>Take that! If you have a problem then come at me!</p><p>‘Son’</p><p>‘Whatever you choose’</p><p>‘Whatever you choose, you must choose better than me—’</p><p>I wonder if it was because of the beer.</p><p>I recalled something unpleasant.</p><p>A kind of trauma.</p><p>I opened a second can of beer and muttered.</p><p>“I succeeded in running away, father.”</p><p>Those were my last words to my father.</p><p>I stayed in the corner of my home and didn’t come out.</p><p>Goodbye, labor.</p><p>Goodbye, world.</p><p>I’ll be going to the world across the monitor.</p><p>Adieu.</p><p>♦</p><p>—Two months passed in a blink of an eye.</p><p>I’ve conquered the computer games I couldn’t enjoy for the past 4 years.&nbsp;<em>(TL note: How the heck is that possible… in 2 months.)</em></p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“This is life……”</p><p>I was silently moved to tears.</p><p>I’ve been only consuming convenience store packed lunches, so my current figure was getting close to the border of that of a homosapien gorilla.</p><p>Trash was littered on all four sides of me.</p><p>The desk with my monitor on top was especially impressive.</p><p>The Empire of Empty Cup Ramens and the Republic of Empty Beer Cans were conquering the desk—continent, and having their own world war while drawing all kinds of geometrical national borders. In this world I’m what you’d call an absolute God. If it’s unfavorable for the Empire then I’d add a cup ramen. If it’s unfavorable for the Republic then I’d add a beer can. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that it was thanks to me that balance was able to be kept in this continent……</p><p>At that moment a notification popped up on my monitor.</p><p>—Tirring~</p><p>An email arrived.</p><p>Moving my mouse over, I clicked to check it.</p><blockquote><p><strong>[Thank you for enjoying our company’s game, &lt;Dungeon Attack&gt;.&nbsp;</strong><strong>In order to improve for the next expansion, we are doing a survey.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Participants will be able to gain the chance to be a beta tester for&nbsp;</strong><strong>the next installment!]</strong></p></blockquote><p>It was a normal email.</p><p>My email address was probably subscribed when I bought the game.</p><p>Right when I was about to delete the mail, I hesitated.</p><p>“Next expansion, huh?”</p><p>A standard dungeon-capturing RPG, &lt;Dungeon Attack&gt;.</p><p>It was one of the games that I enjoyed during the two months.</p><p>Become a hero and defeat the Demon Lords.</p><p>The difficulty was a bit strange, so it was incredibly challenging. First run, I could barely defeat the mid-boss. Second run, third run, and finally on the sixteenth run, after tedious grinding, I was narrowly able to win against the final boss.</p><p>There’s no business in grinding.&nbsp;<em>(TL note:&nbsp;¯_(ツ)_/¯)</em></p><p>My hero character got stronger after each run.</p><p>In the NPC’s perspective, I probably seemed like a fraud and a cheat, but what can you do? Life was irrational from the very start.</p><p>Some starts life with high stats while other’s don’t.</p><p>—click.</p><p>I accepted the survey with a click of my mouse. It’ll probably ask me questions like; was the difficulty reasonable, was there any inconvenience with the interface, boring questions like that. Regardless, I was able to spend an enjoyable amount of time on &lt;Dungeon Attack&gt;. I’ll play along.</p><p>A new page opened up on my monitor screen.</p><p>[1. In the end, I prefer small girls!]</p><p>[2. In the end, I prefer mature women!]</p><p>“……”</p><p>A completely unpredictable Mr. Question has appeared.</p><p>I grasped onto my mind that went blank for a moment.</p><p>What is this, a small joke? Are proper questions going to come out after this?</p><p>After thinking for a moment, I chose number 2. If you were someone with common sense then it was only appropriate to select number 2. Everyone, lolita complex is a mental illness.</p><p>On the white screen, the second question appeared.</p><p>[1. In the end, I get excited when I get hit by someone……!]</p><p>[2. In the end, I get excited when I hit someone……!]</p><p>“What kind of survey is this!?”</p><p>I shouted at the monitor.</p><p>The periods+exclamation mark at the end of the sentence made it feel pointlessly vivid. It looked as if you were confessing your secret sexual desires, doesn’t it……!</p><p>I glared at the monitor with a disgusted look.</p><p>For now, I selected number 2. To be hit or to hit. If I had to choose between the two, then I could only choose the latter. I’ve heard that there was a group of people in the world who felt pleasure from pain, but thank the heavens, I’m not a pervert.</p><p>[1. I prefer a low difficulty.]</p><p>[2. I prefer a high difficulty.]</p><p>After that, I got normal quality questions.</p><p>They most likely placed the weird questions in the front to gain the surveyee’s attention.</p><p>To compliment them for being smart, or to complain that they put too much thought into this survey.</p><p>[1. I solve my problems with strength.]</p><p>[2. I solve my problems with knowledge.]</p><p>Without any hesitation I chose number 2.</p><p>I stopped trying to solve my problems through force since the time I got beat up by the girl sitting next to me in kindergarten. People called humans like me a ‘refined pacifist’.</p><p>[1. I gain benefit from keeping other people’s secrets.]</p><p>[2. I gain pleasure from using other people’s secrets.]</p><p>Once again, with no hesitation, I chose number two.</p><p>During kindergarten, once I obtained the information that the girl sitting next to me wet her bed every morning, I took advantage of it as much as possible. After having done so, I learned the greatness of information. Diplomatic studies call this kind of politics ‘armed neutrality’.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>[1. Friendship means to go forward together towards the same goal.]</p><p>[2. Friendship means a friend who hasn’t betrayed you yet.]</p><p>Ooh. I don’t know who it was, but they need to give a round of applause to the staff who made option number two.</p><p>Now that I think about it, I’ve been only choosing the second option. It must mean that number 1 points to abnormal and number 2 points to normal.</p><p>I think about thirty questions had passed.</p><p>A question with a different format was displayed for the first time.</p><p><strong>[Do you know how this world ends?]</strong></p><p>[Yes]</p><p>[No]</p><p>I stopped my mouse.</p><p>…… It was a question purposely made abstract.</p><p>It was a sentence that only players who very faithfully played the game could understand.</p><p>Dungeon Attack.</p><p>The hero subjugates the Demon Lords.</p><p>A simple structure.</p><p>However&nbsp;…… in the end, the world probably arrives at destruction. The reason why the word ‘probably’ was included was simple. The game did not kindly tell you what happened to the world after the ending. This was merely the conclusion I came to on my own while going through the campaign.</p><p>In &lt;Dungeon Attack&gt;, Demon Lords are owners of magical energy, people with a massive amount of magical energy condensed into them. What happens if all these people are killed off.</p><p>The magical energy will overflow.</p><p>Like as if many reservoirs collapse at the same time and cause a flood.</p><p>The hero killed off the Demon Lords in order to protect mankind and as a result the balance of magical energy collapsed, then, contrary to what was intended, the end of mankind and the destruction&nbsp;of the world……</p><p>This was what I thought to be the ‘true ending’ of the game.</p><p>Thank you very much, protagonist.</p><p>Thank you very much, player.</p><p>Yet, we must apologize, that due to your efforts the world was destroyed.</p><p>No hopes or dreams.</p><p>That’s why I liked it.</p><p>A pessimistic world outlook…… it suited my taste.</p><p>I spoke the words ‘yes’, and clicked my mouse.</p><p>As if it was calculating something, it took some time before the next question appeared.</p><p>The sentence to appear on screen was abstract again.</p><p><strong>[If it were you, could you change the ending?]</strong></p><p>I wonder.</p><p>To protect mankind and to also not slaughter demons.</p><p>In other words, to bring peace between the two races.</p><p>According to the setting, humans and demons have been going at each other for nearly 3,000 years. It’d probably be easier to make the leader of Islamic extremists reconcile with the president of the United States of America.</p><p>Would I be able to do such a thing……</p><p>I started thinking.</p><p>Then thought some more.</p><p>And…</p><p><strong>[Yes]</strong></p><p>The sound of a click rang, and at the same time.</p><p>“……!”</p><p>A bright white light shined from my monitor screen.</p><p>This was the last scenery I could remember.</p><p>A bell chimed somewhere. No, it could have been the sound of an explosion. The feeling of the world around me being flipped— as if my skull was being expanded on all four sides.</p><p>My hearing went numb and everything felt distant.</p><p>My vision kept blinking.</p><p>I couldn’t move my eyelids on my own accord.</p><p>As if someone else was opening and closing my eyes for me.</p><p>My conscience stopped.</p><p>Then.</p><p>Then…………</p><p><strong>[The tutorial shall now begin.]</strong></p><p><strong>[Difficulty set to LUNATIC (Highest possible setting).]</strong></p><p><strong>[START]</strong></p><p>Then I opened my eyes.</p>"

      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><h3>Chapter 2 – A Devil Steps on Stage (Part 1)</h3><p>The ceiling broke and fell.</p><p>A large rock landed right in front of my face.</p><p>“What……!”</p><p>I quickly gained my senses.</p><p>Instinctively, I took a step back, however, with a thud, my back bumped against something. It was a wall.</p><p>Carefully looking around myself, I realized I was in a pitch black cavern.</p><p>I had gone to see a stalactite cave before during a school trip  before. From what I could see, the ceiling now was 2-3 times higher than  that cave. It was so high up that I could just barely see the top. I  couldn’t possibly imagine how faraway the dark mouth of the cave was.</p><p>“……”</p><p>I killed my breath.</p><p>Why was I here?</p><p>How did I get here?</p><p>A loud siren rang in my head. My conscience instantly went cold.  Whenever I found myself in an unpredicted situation my head would cool  down in order to compose myself.</p><p>It was because of the trauma I had experienced when I was young.</p><p>I had been kidnapped three times in my life. The memory from those  times forced open my skull and poured in ice-cold water, as if telling  me to stay on my toes.</p><p>‘Do not scream’, that’ll only irritate the kidnappers.</p><p>‘Talk to yourself quietly’, you can confirm your situation this way.</p><p>Behavior procedures prepared like a manual.</p><p>Like a special forces unit listening to orders while facing  terrorists, my conscience more than gladly followed the  guidelines carved into my memory.</p><p>“……I was sitting in my room a moment ago…… and using the computer. It  was 7PM. Drank 2 cans of beer. For dinner I had cup ramen……”</p><p>Little by little, my breathing became calmer.</p><p>There was no problem with my memory.</p><p>It at least meant that this wasn’t a drug induced kidnapping.</p><p>⌈There were no drugs.⌋</p><p>With just this the situation was reasonably favorable. It meant that the kidnapper had the intent to talk with me.</p><p>That’s why the kidnapping when I was in my third year of elementary  school was serious. The motive then was to plainly obtain my body. I had  to unconditionally keep my mouth shut. No reason whatsoever……</p><p>“Okay. Next……”</p><p>I checked my senses.</p><p>In order; vision, scent, hearing, taste, and touch.</p><p>Without rushing, I had to make sure my senses were working properly.</p><p>“The location appears to be a cave. Definitely a cave. It’s very  dark. Doesn’t seem like my vision got worse. Rock, paper, scissor……”</p><p>I moved my fingers to make the shapes.</p><p>I could see the forms properly.</p><p>Good. My vision was fine.</p><p>The problem was scent.</p><p>“……!”</p><p>A foul nauseating smell.</p><p>The smell of blood vibrated around me.</p><p>I wonder if it was because I had suddenly found myself in an  unfamiliar environment, but I wasn’t paying attention to the smell until  now. Now that I’ve realized it, the revolting smell was so intense that  it felt like it got past my nostril’s and shook my very brain.</p><p>“This is……”</p><p>It was a scent I had smelled three or four times in my life.</p><p>A scent which I never wanted to smell again. The smell of blood and intestines.</p><p>Corpses were spread throughout the cave.</p><p>There were human corpses that were swollen as if they were drowned,  bodies with slit throats, and even bodies with limbs bent in the wrong  direction.</p><p>“Eugh…… euuk……”</p><p>If this cave was one of those art exhibitions, then the curator would  undoubtedly be an absurdly perverted sadist. As if triumphantly  displaying that humans could die in this many ways. The fact that the  cave was dark was the only solace since the corpses were comparatively  hard to see.</p><p>“Is this place supposed to be the mystery of the human body…… Damn it.”</p><p>I had to get out of here quickly.</p><p>I put my right foot forward and— fell just like that.</p><p>My ankle was broken.</p><p>The entire bone was broken. It wasn’t something like an adorable sprain.</p><p>“Shit.”</p><p>I unintentionally let out a curse. I had to conclude that I couldn’t  run or walk. The pain wasn’t ordinary. If the kidnapper approached now  then it was impossible to escape. Perhaps they broke my ankle on  purpose. Keeping safety measures. This was probably why they didn’t use  drugs.</p><p>“Haa.”</p><p>I sat down in defeat.</p><p>I was regretfully checkmated.</p><p>Why did they kidnap someone like me, I couldn’t understand.</p><p>“…… I left all the fortune to my siblings. If it was two months ago  then maybe, but there’s no point of kidnapping me right now.”</p><p>Surely they don’t mean to take me as hostage and threaten my siblings.</p><p>Foolish. I don’t know about someone else, but the person currently  leading our household was my second half little sister. She could manage  the household with composure, although not as good as I did. You’ll get  hurt if you underestimate my sibling just because she’s young.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Hooo……”</p><p>I could only sigh when thinking about who the culprit was.</p><p>There were plenty of people spread across the world who could want  revenge against me. There were also surprisingly a lot of fellows who  still had a grudge against my father as well, but wanted to let it out  on me instead. That’s why I wanted to wipe my hands clean of everything.</p><p>It was then that I heard a hurried voice coming from the other side of the cave.</p><p>“I found him!”</p><p>“The Demon Lord is here!”</p><p>Demon Lord.</p><p>It was a name that had absolutely no connections with me.</p><p>For some reason the voice was directed towards where I was.</p><p>I’m confused. I had been called a devil a considerable amount of  times in my life, but this was the first time I had been called a Demon  Lord. It might be a type of secret code.</p><p>“Stay right there!”</p><p>“We’ll kill you if you move!”</p><p>The people came in like wolves.</p><p>The men were holding edged weapons like knives and axes. There’s no  way I couldn’t be bewildered by this. I shot up both my arms.</p><p>“I surrender!”</p><p>“Get down you bastard!”</p><p>Without warning, the other man grabbed my head and slammed it to the  ground. They were violent with me even though I told them that I  surrendered.</p><p>“Ack……”</p><p>A rock that was lying on the ground sharply stabbed against my cheek.</p><p>“Keep your damn face down! Stay like that till we say otherwise!”</p><p>I almost let out a shout of pain, but I was able to hold it back.</p><p>Loud noises irritated kidnappers. During a kidnapping, even if you’re in pain you must not scream.</p><p>3rd year of Elementary school, I didn’t know anything and kept on  wailing. After being beat until five of my teeth were broken, I had  learned to be silent.</p><p>Silently.</p><p>Politely.</p><p>It may seem stupid, but this was the proper attitude to have towards a kidnapper.</p><p>“I caught him! Riff of Jalsen, has captured the Demon Lord!”</p><p>“Ooh. Our great and handsome captain, Riff. You aren’t planning to take all the bounty on your own, are you?”</p><p>The men started chatting in excitement.</p><p>I held my breath and listened to their conversation.</p><p>“Of course not. I’ll share with everyone equally. Keke.”</p><p>“Look at this. This Demon Lord looks just like a caterpillar.”</p><p>“Looks good with his head on the ground. Let’s kill him already.”</p><p>“What do you mean, kill him? There are things we still haven’t asked him yet.”</p><p>Someone kicked my side.</p><p>It wasn’t a genuine hit but more done jokingly, regardless that alone was pretty painful.</p><p>“—but just in case, we should break him.”</p><p>“Friends! Let us beat the Demon Lord into a reasonably sized pulp.”</p><p>Merciless violence showered down upon me.</p><p>Ten people were kicking me. I desperately held back my screams. More  than 5 minutes had passed before the kicking started to subside.</p><p>“Good good. That’s enough.”</p><p>“Guys. Our handsome boss said to stop.”</p><p>“Keke.”</p><p>The violence finally stopped.</p><p>While I was breathing roughly, one of the men spoke to me as a representative.</p><p>“Well now, honorable Demon Lord. There’s one thing that we wish to  ask you. Where’s all the money in this castle. To tell you the truth, us  village folk are in real need of money.”</p><p>As expected, I was kidnapped for money.</p><p>Wait, but they’ve been keep using words that I’m not familiar with.  This was something that I had to confirm. There was a chance that they  were mistaking me for someone else.</p><p>“What do you mean by ‘Demon Lord’……?”</p><p>When I opened my mouth, I let out a groan. My lips were torn.</p><p>“Good. Very good.”</p><p>The man insinuated.</p><p>“Despite being hit so much, you’re still able to display such a  nature. An excellent stance. Keke. I don’t hate that kind of thing, your  honorable Demon Lord.”</p><p>With a rough hand the man grabbed my hair.</p><p>“Ack……”</p><p>I was forced to raise my face.</p><p>I made eye contact with the man in front of me.</p><p>The man had bent his body forward and was looking down at me. His  entire face was covered in a brown beard. A darkish mushroom that grew  in a public bathroom that hadn’t been cleaned for over 5 years, that was  what his beard looked like. In simpler words, frighteningly dirty.</p><p>“But my friends here don’t have as much patience as me.”</p><p>“……what can I help you with?”</p><p>“Your honor. We don’t desire to use pointless violence.”</p><p>That’s convincing.</p><p>“Instead of wasting each other’s energy, let us trade. Tell us where  the treasury is and we will not kill your honor immediately. We won’t  cut your arms or legs off. And, of course, we won’t cut your precious  horn off, either. Think carefully. In truth, we’re the ones at a loss in  this trade.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Yeah, at a great loss!”</p><p>They broke out into laughter.</p><p>It was laughter of people who had a rough birth.</p><p>I waited for the mood to settle before speaking again. Always courteously. Making sure to not irritate their mood.</p><p>I asked a question.</p><p>“I’m sorry, but what do you mean by horn?”</p><p>“Aah? What are you asking.”</p><p>The man placed his hand on the back of my head.</p><p>“This. I’m talking about this.”</p><p>The man had grabbed something on my head. My head that should only have hair. There, something long was attached all the way to my skull.</p><p>I felt the back of my head.</p><p>There was certainly something hard there.</p><p>The shape was, as the man had said, in the shape of a horn.</p><p>“…………”</p><p>This.</p><p>What could this creation be.</p><p>I gazed forward with blank eyes.</p><p>Don’t tell me.</p><p>Before I was kidnapped, no, before I lost conscience. I was responding to a game survey on my computer.</p><p>When I opened my eyes in this cavern I had heard a faint voice…… I’m  certain it whispered ‘The tutorial shall now begin’. I ignored it  because I thought it was some nonsense from my dream.</p><p>The man had called me Demon Lord. There was something like a horn actually attached to the back of my head……</p><p>Game. Tutorial. Demon Lord.</p><p>These three words pointed at one possibility.</p><p>Fortunately or unfortunately, my mind quickly came to a conclusion.</p><p>“Now. Your honor, Demon Lord Dantalian. We’ll ask you only one more time.”</p><p>I couldn’t accept the answer.</p><p>The common sense, experience, and knowledge I had gained throughout  my entire life completely denied the conclusion. However, as if laughing  at my escape from reality, an alarm rang.</p><p>—Tirring~</p><p>White words appeared in mid-air.</p><p>[1. Accept adventurer captain Riff’s offer.]</p><p>[2. Decline adventurer captain Riff’s offer.]</p><p>“……”</p><p>I was at a lost for words.</p><p>Undeniable proof had presented itself right before me.</p><p>“Will you accept our offer? Or will you just die here. Wow. You can’t  get choices as clean as this. Keke. Hurry and pick, oh honorable Demon  Lord.”</p><p>The man gave an ill-tempered laugh. It was certain that the man couldn’t see the floating words.</p><p>Is it like that</p><p>Is it like that</p><p>…… is it like that.</p><p>My monologue continued and echoed in my drifting away conscience.</p><p>Like an actor who forgot his lines on stage and kept repeating his last spoken line.</p><p>I bit my lips. The taste of blood spread throughout my mouth. The  vividly raw taste brought my conscience back to reality. In front of me  was a barbaric man with a broad grin on his face.</p><p>Willing or not—</p><p>I’m a Demon Lord in the world of &lt;Dungeon Attack&gt;.</p><p>My head went cold.</p><p>As if time was flowing slowly.</p><p>“Mr. Demon Lord’s response is a bit slow.”</p><p>I gazed at the man who had just spoke.</p><p>It wasn’t only this man who had skipped shaving. The other people  around us also had beards. It might be normal for these men to not  shave.</p><p>‘Their outfits are old.’</p><p>‘Way too old.’</p><p>‘To be precise, I’d say about 400 years old.’</p><p>Around the time Henry the IV of France fought lively against the  Roman Catholics, perhaps. The clothes looked similar to the one’s worn  by the people during the French Wars of Religion. They were outfits that  should have been sent straight to the museum, but no matter how you  looked at these men they didn’t look like they worked at a museum.</p><p>“Are you really planning to not answer?”</p><p>Situations that couldn’t be understood until now were starting to be  explained by assumptions. For example, as if a mysterious phenomenon was  finally explained by the laws of physics.</p><p>“Oi, your honor Dantalian.”</p><p>Demon Lord Dantalian.</p><p>These people have been calling me Dantalian.</p><p>That was the name of the Demon Lord who showed up in &lt;Dungeon Attack&gt;.</p><p>There are a total of 72 Demon Lords who appear in that game. Amongst  them, Dantalian was ranked 71st. He was that close to last place.  Correspondingly, his level was also miserably low. In the first place,  he was like a trash mob made for beginners.</p><p>Even a person playing computer games for the first time could beat him on the first run.</p><p>If I had to compare it with another game, then he was like a rabbit  in the beginner field. As long as you knew how to click your mouse then  you could defeat the rabbit. Dantalian was the same.</p><p>…… I should also add.</p><p>After the first run, Dantalian doesn’t appear at all in the game. He was removed in case that players got annoyed.</p><p>Imagine telling a level 20 warrior to ‘Go back to the beginner field  and hunt a rabbit’. It’d be boring. Dantalian was a rabbit that you  didn’t feel like fighting again.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>And if I’m correct, I’m currently possessing that Dantalian.</p><p>“……”</p><p>There was a bitter taste in my mouth.</p><p>How do I get out of the evil hands of these adventurers.</p><p>I’m currently captured by humans. If this goes on I’ll probably get  my head cut off or be taken to the city and executed. No matter how much  I strained my brain I could only think of BAD ENDS.</p><p>Even if I proclaimed ‘I’m not Dantalian!’, I’d be grateful if I even got a sneer in response.</p><p>I couldn’t rely on Demon Lord Dantalian’s ability.</p><p>Let me rephrase that.</p><p>I could only rely on my own ability in order to overcome this obstacle.</p><p>“If you’re testing my patience right now……”</p><p>“The treasury is in Minlakdong.” <em>(TL note: He’ll explain what this is in a short bit)</em></p><p>I made my resolution.</p><h4>▯Adventurer, Cowardly Looter, Riff Hoffman<p> Empire Calender: Year 1505, Month 4, Day 4</p><p> Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle</p></h4><p>Looter Riff.</p><p>That was my nickname.</p><p>Despite being an adventurer, I didn’t hunt demons, but instead,  looted other adventurers. That’s how I go the nickname. Well, let them  call me whatever they want.</p><p>The people who honestly hunt demons are the fools, aren’t they?</p><p>The one’s who live skillfully in the world are the ones who benefits.</p><p>Using common sense, people who fought monsters like orcs and goblins are idiots. I’m saying this very seriously and sincerely.</p><p>To live a not sincere life and become a corpse, or to live a sincere  life and become a cowardly looter. If I had to choose between the two,  then of course I’d choose the latter. Will I still choose the latter if I  die and become reincarnated? I won’t ever die.</p><p>Keke.</p><p>Regardless, light was finally shining down on my looter career.</p><p>Half a month ago, I obtained the map of Demon Lord Dantalian’s  Castle. I was lucky. There was a girl too pretty to be rotting away in  some lowly village. I was going to assault her a little bit, but, while  presenting me this map, she pleaded, “I’ll give you this, so please  spare me.”. She was a girl with beautiful red hair.</p><p>Hm? Of course assaulting a virgin is wrong.</p><p>But I really like doing bad things.</p><p>I told you already.</p><p>I’m a looter.</p><p>I don’t only loot the pockets of dead adventurers, but the virginity  of all the young women in the world as well. Personally, I’d preferred  to be called ‘Virginity Looter’. Something like ‘The Looter of  Virginities’ sounds like a cool title. It’s good because it sounds  romantic.</p><p>Thanks to this map, I was able to gather a bunch of random  adventurers. Dantalian was one of the weakest Demon Lords and there was  most likely no monsters in the castle. As long as we knew where to find  him, then it’d be easy to capture him.</p><p>We used an artifact that detected magical energy to search inside of  the cavern. We wandered the dark cave for about four hours, but our  efforts weren’t in vain. We were able to capture the Demon Lord  Dantalian. Amazing! The map was real!</p><p>“Look at this. This Demon Lord looks just like a caterpillar.”</p><p>My comrades were chuckling while holding the Demon Lord down.</p><p>“Looks good with his head on the ground. Let’s kill him already.”</p><p>“What do you mean, kill him!?”</p><p>I gave the person who spoke a vulgar look. You could gain a higher  reward if you captured the Demon Lord alive. Also there was something we  still hadn’t asked him yet. Where the treasure was.</p><p>Gain whatever information we could get. That was common sense.</p><p>First things first, we beat the Demon Lord up and then asked him where the treasury was.</p><p>But this Demon Lord, his reaction was strange.</p><p>He’d suddenly stare at an empty space and he’d narrow his brows and  lower his chin as if he was in deep thought. What is this? Is he an  idiot? I vaguely thought Demon Lords were supposed to be ghastly  tyrants, but what is this small fry.</p><p>Well, since he was a small fry someone like me could capture him. I  have no complaints. I love small fries. I’d gladly decline Demon Lords  like Barbatos or Paimon.</p><p>“Mr. Demon Lord’s response is a bit slow. Are you really planning to not answer?”</p><p>I snickered and tapped the Demon Lord’s cheek.”</p><p>“Oi, your honor Dantalian.”</p><p>It was then.</p><p>“……”</p><p>It was for a mere moment, but the Demon Lord had a dreadfully spine chilling gaze.</p><p> I blinked a couple of times and after doing so, the same minor small fry-looking Demon Lord was in front of me again.</p><p>Huh?</p><p>The atmosphere changed for a brief moment.</p><p>…… was I seeing things?</p><p>Oh well. Treasure. Treasure was more important.</p><p>Let’s keep pressing this Demon Lord.</p><h3>Chapter 2: A Devil Steps on Stage (Part 2)</h3><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian\n<div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p> Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 4, Day 4</p><p> Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>“The treasury is in Minlakdong.”</p><p>The other party furrowed their eyebrows.</p><p>“Mayirock…… what?”</p><p>“Minlakdong. It’s at the Minlakdong.”</p><p>I told them the location of the treasury for the second time.</p><p>Honestly, I just said the name of whatever neighborhood that came to mind.</p><p> How was I supposed to know where the treasury of the Demon Lord’s castle was?</p><p>And if I sincerely answered, ‘I don’t know where it is’, I’d probably  get a blade flying my way. For now, I had to say whatever I could in  order to gain their interest.</p><p>I had to carefully pay attention to the men’s reactions.</p><p>“Millak, Mooirakkutoung…… the damn pronunciation is strange!”</p><p>“Do you not know of it? Here, I’ll write it down.”</p><p>Offering to write it down, I lowered my body and wrote on the cavern floor.</p><p>I didn’t have any writing utensils, but I did shed a lot of blood. Dipping my finger in my own blood, I smoothly wrote the word.</p><p>민락동</p><p> 民樂洞</p><p>First line in Korean. Second line in Chinese characters.</p><p>I slightly turned my line of sight to see their reaction.</p><p>“Hey, bring the torch closer.”</p><p>“I have no idea…… were there letters like this?”</p><p>They faced each other and started talking.</p><p>“None of us here even know how to read.”</p><p>“Yeah, but the shape is completely different.”</p><p>Okay.</p><p>I generally understood the principle of the language.</p><p>I currently heard everything they said in Korean. However, when I wrote the words, they couldn’t understand.</p><p>In conclusion, just because I heard everything in Korean didn’t mean they also heard in Korean as well.</p><p>There were two possibilities.</p><p>One, the pronunciation was the same but the letters were different.  Or two, both the pronunciation and letters were different but for some reason only I perceived everything in Korean.</p><p>Which one was the answer.</p><p>I decided to test it immediately.</p><p>“It’s natural for this to be unfamiliar to you gentlemen. This is  ancient demon language. In order to fully secure the treasury, I had  specifically used ancient demon language to magically seal the  treasure.”</p><p>“Magic?”</p><p>“Yes. The vault will not open to those who do not understand the language.”</p><p>The men made a commotion.</p><p>The answer was revealed by that conversation.</p><p>We were currently talking in a language completely different from Korean, in terms of both pronunciation and letters.</p><p>How do I know this? Because I had spoken in foreign languages just now.</p><p>First sentence in English, second sentence in German, third sentence  in Chinese, and fourth sentence in Japanese. And yet, these men  understood me fully.</p><p>I don’t know by what principle, but the conversation was automatically being translated.</p><p>“Mr. Demon Lord. Do we, uh, need to understand that ancient demon language thing to open the vault?”</p><p>“Yes. Of course.”</p><p>“Hmmm.”</p><p>The man narrowed his brows.</p><p>— Right now this person was trying to kill me.</p><p>He promised to spare my life if I told him the location of the secret  vault, but that was a big fat lie. You could tell someone was lying  shamelessly by their face.</p><p>So accordingly, I had to give them a reason to keep me alive.</p><p>“Alright, honorable Demon Lord. I like this fair trade.”</p><p>The man fell for my lie nicely.</p><p>“I think we can be good friends. So, where’s this Mooirakkutoung, exactly?” <em>(TL note: These guys are pronouncing it incorrectly)</em></p><p>“There’s a secret passage where I was originally at.”</p><p>“The Demon Lord’s quarters? There was nothing there when we checked.”</p><p>“That’s not so. In my quarters, it will only recognize me and open……  There’s a secret passage that only opens when I place my hand on it.”</p><p>“A magical device. Okay.”</p><p>The man grabbed my arm and forced me up.</p><p>A horrible pain spread from my right ankle. I couldn’t hold back my scream this time.</p><p>“Aaack!”</p><p>“Oh. Your leg is messed up.”</p><p>The man clicked his tongue.</p><p>“New guy! You support his honor, Dantalian.”</p><p>“Roger that, captain.”</p><p>A young man, who I assumed to be the new guy, came over to support  me. He had a dagger attached to his belt. The adventurer group captain  then shouted.</p><p>“Let’s get moving boys!”</p><p>The group of ten adventurers moved forward through the cave.</p><p>These men seemed to know where the Demon Lord’s quarter was. I was lucky since I had no idea where it could possibly be.</p><p>If they had told me to lead them to my quarters, I’d probably have died on the spot.</p><p>A bell rang with a ‘Tirring~’ sound.</p><p>[1. Accept adventurer captain Riff’s offer.]</p><p>[2. Decline adventurer captain Riff’s offer.]</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The first choice shined brightly and then new words rose up. The  choice wasn’t selected because I thought of selecting it, but rather, it  was selected by my actual actions.</p><p>[Overcame the crisis with cunning eloquence.]</p><p>[Warning. Actions taken during the tutorial will henceforth affect your stats.]</p><p>I got passed the crisis.</p><p>In other words, it meant that if I didn’t lie to them then I really  would have been in a fatal situation. The unnecessary remark sent a  chill down my spine.</p><p>These people were not joking around.</p><p>To live or to die. That was the question.</p><p>I barely got past the first obstacle.</p><p>By any means, I had to stay alive.</p><p>♦</p><p>The adventurer group continued to walk through the cavern.</p><p>“How about just killing him now……”</p><p>“Yeah. We aren’t some group of thieves. Instead of wasting time searching for a hidden vault, we could end it here neatly……”</p><p>“I don’t know about you guys, but I agree with the captain. Nothing bad about getting a bit more money……”</p><p>I could hear the adventurers talking up ahead.</p><p>I don’t care if you’re going to discuss  whether I live or die, but could you at least speak in a voice that I  couldn’t hear. It’s not that hard.</p><p>They have no manners.</p><p>“Hey. Even if his leg is sprained, isn’t he a bit too slow?”</p><p>“Like I said. He’s probably stalling.”</p><p>They went as far as to flat out make sarcastic remarks.</p><p>The level of these adventurers that had captured me weren’t very good.</p><p>They radiated poorness. The blade of their  weapons were jagged. It was proof that they didn’t properly maintain  their gear. In the game’s standard, they’d be ranked F. The lowest  adventurer group. They were around that level.</p><p>They’d get wiped by around 20 goblins.</p><p>…Although, not being able to put under  command those goblins that are spread almost everywhere, was Demon Lord  Dantalian’s level.</p><p>“Your honor, Demon Lord. My comrades are a bit impatient.”</p><p>The man called Riff, informed me with a snicker.</p><p>I lowered my head.</p><p>“I apologize. I’ll try harder to walk faster.”</p><p>“A nice and fast response. That’s good.”</p><p>He was talking to me like I was inferior.</p><p>I had now decided. I will definitely destroy that proud face of his. I’ll drag this man’s face in the mud.</p><p>I won’t go easy on him even if he begs for mercy later. Look forward to it, Riff.</p><p>“Us adventurers have an occupational  disease. It seems they’re suspicious that your honor is trying to trick  us. That you’re stalling for time to do something to us.”</p><p>“That’s impossible.”</p><p>I immediately replied.</p><p>There was no gain from telling them the truth.</p><p>Now, time to start the performance.</p><p>“I used to have subordinates as well.  Goblins, imps, orcs…… nothing special, but they were still my precious  subordinates. However, before you gentlemen, groups of adventurers had  assaulted this castle three times in a row.”</p><p>The edge of my eye became wet.</p><p>I had the ability to cry on command. It required a little trick. It was a special move that my little sisters had taught me.</p><p>“You gentlemen are the fourth to arrive at  my castle. My subordinates are all already dead. Even the little ones  that have been with me for over 30 years. All of them……”</p><p>“H-Huh?”</p><p>Riff panicked.</p><p>“Surely, your honor, you aren’t crying now, are you?”</p><p>“N-No. Cry? I would never.”</p><p>I spoke like a child who was desperately trying to hold back his tears.</p><p>“It’s just that amongst them, there was a  nanny who had taken care of me since I was a mere infant. Yes. She  looked like an orc. That’s because she was an orc. But she took care of  me sincerely. I even called her ‘mother’. A week ago, she was pierced in  the chest with a spear by an adventurer and died……”</p><p>Pitiful crying echoed throughout the cave.</p><p>“Well. That, what should I say. That’s quite unfortunate. You have my condolences.”</p><p>“She held me until the very end. Even after  being stabbed, even after shedding so much blood, she continued to hold  me tightly to protect me from the falling arrows. Everyone, I can not  forget the emotions I went through during that time no matter how hard I  try……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“She had wrapped both of her arms around me. I couldn’t see a thing, but with a <em>thud</em>, her body shook. <em>Thud thud,</em>  her body kept shaking. I didn’t know what was happening at first,  however, I soon found out that it was because of the arrows. Each time  an arrow fell, her body would shudder. Despite that……”</p><p>Let a tear fall here once.</p><p>My act was about to reach its climax.</p><p>“Despite all that, she was looking down at  me and smiling! Yes, she smiled till the very end. I wasn’t sane. I  thought I was going crazy. The most precious person in the world to me  was dying in front of my very eyes…… dying to protect me, she was even  smiling…… What was I supposed to say!?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I covered my face with my hands.</p><p>Weak crying leaked from between my fingers.</p><p>“I asked if it hurt. If she was in pain, but do you know what she told me in response?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“‘I’m alright, young master’.”</p><p>The air was dead silent.</p><p>The adventurers had been captivated by my story at some point and were now quiet.</p><p>My father had trained me to be an actor since I was a child.</p><p>I went through a test at one point. Go to any cafe and talk on the phone.</p><p>In truth, no sound came from the phone, but I pretended to argue with my girlfriend.</p><p>‘I’m sorry. I’m sorry for everything.’</p><p>‘I’ll do better from now on.’</p><p>Improvised acting.</p><p>At first, the reaction from the other cafe customers was annoyance.</p><p>They were simply relaxing in a cafe and then  suddenly some high school student appeared and started talking loudly  on his phone. Regardless, as time past, their expressions slowly  shifted. Their emotions changed.</p><p>It was sympathy.</p><p>They had experience the same thing before.  They had pleaded to a loved one at a point in their life. Feeling  empathy, they finally started to treat me with pity.</p><p>This was the reaction of modern people who had already experienced all kinds of stimulating romance dramas and movies.</p><p>The people of this world, who at best have  only listened to the self bragging of a wandering poet, I’m sorry to  say, but they were no match for me.</p><p>The fineness facial muscles</p><p> to the most detailed nuance.</p><p>Using this at my own will, I preformed passionately.</p><p>“It’s okay, she said…… and she died.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Now I have nothing left. I did have two  goblins, but I made them leave. I don’t need them…… That’s why it’s okay  to not be suspicious of me. There’s really nothing left here.”</p><p>I covered my face once again and sobbed.</p><p>My acting, which could have made a French actor cry, ended here.</p><p>In this depressing atmosphere, the adventurers had started to whisper to one another.</p><p>“Hey hey. Who made the honorable Demon Lord cry?”</p><p>“I didn’t know he had such circumstances either.”</p><p>“I was wondering why there were no guards. Other parties had already wiped this place clean.”</p><p>“So he suddenly lost everything. Tsk tsk……”</p><p>As predicted, sympathy fell upon me.</p><p>There was something I didn’t predict that happened too. It was the white notice that rose up in mid-air.</p><p>[Your devilish eloquence has captivated the people.]</p><p>[Adventurer Riff’s affection went up by 2.]</p><p>[Adventurer Dail’s affection went up by 1.]</p><p>There was an affection system as well, huh.</p><p>That made things easier.</p><p>“I am grateful to have met you all, though.”</p><p>I smiled faintly.</p><p>Giving off an atmosphere as if I had seen the sorrows and joys of life was the point.</p><p>“You didn’t kill a Demon Lord like me  immediately. You showed consideration to me who was seriously injured,  and are even supporting me like this. This is the first time I’ve met  adventurers as gentle as you all in the entirety of my life…… I had  really thought that all adventurers were villainous people like the ones  who had murdered my nanny!”</p><p>That was a lie.</p><p>A flat out lie.</p><p>I knew you men were going to kill me as soon  as you saw me. You probably only sheathed your weapons because you  wanted the money from the treasury. A villain, as described.</p><p>However, no human could dislike being flattered. The adventurers awkwardly scratched their beards.</p><p>“No, we didn’t really do that much……”</p><p>“It’s because your honor cooperated so willingly.”</p><p>[Adventurer Riff’s affection went up by 4.]</p><p>[Adventurer Dail’s affection went up by 3.]</p><p>The other 8 adventurer’s affection went up as well.</p><p>Did their wariness go down? Compared to earlier, the amount of points that went up rose. My acting got through to them properly.</p><p>With a tear drenched face, I grinned broadly.</p><p>“I apologize for delaying everyone. Now, let us resume towards the vault.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>It wasn’t a smile out of happiness, but a  forced smile to match other people. I emphasized that feeling. In order  to plant the seed of guilt into them.</p><p>One of the adventurers coughed into his hand.</p><p>“Ehem. That, uh, there’s no reason for us to deliberately hurry.”</p><p>“That’s right. The vault isn’t going to grow legs and run away.”</p><p>“Since his honor’s foot hurts so much, let’s go slowly. He did say all the other demons were gone.”</p><p>The atmosphere became soft.</p><p>There was a saying that says the scariest  animal on Earth were humans, but I think opposite. Humans were animals  that I could feel most reassured with.</p><p>I can not trick a bear. If I encountered a wild warthog, the least a weakling like me could do was get killed.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>But humans.</p><p>Humans could be deceived.</p><p>Through a performance, you could play with the hearts of others.</p><p>‘Son.’</p><p>‘You’re more of a Devil than I am.’</p><p>My father was right.</p><p>I did not want to admit it, but I had the inborn talent to deceive people.</p><p>Personally, I didn’t think it was a desirable skill. It was more appealing to sincerely gain people’s trust than through lies.</p><p>That was why I avoided using deception  unless I felt like my life was in danger. Something like being good at  lying, it wasn’t a skill worth bragging about.</p><p>It was the same now.</p><p>“Ah, but.”</p><p>If these adventurers had not threaten my life.</p><p>If they had approached me with a bit more politeness.</p><p>I would not have had to bare my fangs.</p><p>“Everyone— if we take too much time, other adventurer parties may arrive.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“As you all know, there is not even a single  goblin left in my castle. As much as it is an empty castle, other  adventurers will probably come for the treasure vault as well. This may  trouble you all……”</p><p>The adventures gave each other unsettled looks.</p><p>There were no monsters in this castle. Even  if there were some left, these men could use me, the Demon Lord, as a  hostage to drive them back. However, there was something more dangerous  than monster.</p><p>Other humans.</p><p>Adventurers competed against other  adventurers rigorously. Treasure hidden in the Demon Lord’s castle. The  bounty on the Demon Lord’s head…… anyone would want to get their hands  on these. Even if they had to kill other humans.</p><p>In &lt;Dungeon Attack&gt;, the hero didn’t  fight only demons. There were many adventurer parties that attacked in  attempt to take the hero’s wealth. They only claimed to be adventurers,  but they were no different to a group of thieves.</p><p>“Damn it. I didn’t consider that.”</p><p>“There’s no certainty that other adventurers will come.”</p><p>The men started to frown. They had taken in seriously my lie.</p><p>“Dumbass. Did you not hear that this place was assaulted 3 times already? Other wolves, who’ve heard the rumor will come.”</p><p>“Not good. This is not good…… We just caught  the Demon Lord and you’re now telling me to risk my life to fight other  lively adventurers? Don’t joke with me.”</p><p>“Shit. Like we’d hand him over to a bunch of dogs.”</p><p>These were adventurers, who had just left  their hometowns for the first time to get rich quick. They couldn’t  contain their excitement when they were presented the opportunity to  turn their lives around.</p><p>“Everyone.”</p><p>I spoke in a calm voice. Their gaze naturally collected onto me.</p><p>“At this moment, other adventurers may  already be approaching. How about making our way to the vault first?  There’s not a lot of time. We can discuss things while moving.”</p><p>The men glanced at each other once more and nodded all together.</p><p>“His honor is right. Let’s take the treasure first. Yeah!”</p><p>“Let’s get a move on! We don’t have the right to show our faces in Jalsen without a few scratches or two.”</p><p>With loud voices, the adventurers resumed their march.</p><p>Good.</p><p>This was enough for now.</p><p>I gave them an agreeable suggestion. Their  guard against Demon Lord Dantalian may not be completely gone, but at  least they don’t see me as an ‘enemy’ now. Their affection continued to  rise. That was a good sign……</p><p>“New guy, carry his honor on your back. That’ll be faster.”</p><p>“Roger that, captain!”</p><p>The man lifted me up promptly.</p><p>“Ah, thank you very much.”</p><p>“What do you eat normally to be so light? You look fine on the outside but it’s like your insides are empty.”</p><p>As if I weighed nothing, the man walked with  light steps. I suddenly ended up getting a piggy back ride, but this  was much better than forcing myself to walk.</p><p>I guess you could say that I got passed the second obstacle.</p><p>I was required to open the treasure vault,  hence giving them a reason to keep me alive. Furthermore, I was able to  raise their affection towards me, giving them the false impression that I  was on their side. It was favorable. However, there were still two  problems remaining.</p><p>The first problem was that I had no idea if a  treasury existed at all. As soon as they find out that I lied,  regardless of affection points or whatever, they’ll murder me.</p><p>The other problem was getting rid of the  adventurers. If I couldn’t solve these two problems then my fate will  always lead to death.</p><p>‘Base status’</p><p>I moved my lips slightly and whispered.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>Without being discouraged, I kept experimenting.</p><p>‘Dungeon status, dungeon situation…… Mm. Not this either, huh.’</p><p>I currently  had the ability to access the game system.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>It was merely an assumption, but I should be  able to use the other status windows than just affection points. For  example, being able to see the map of the castle. I was aiming for that.</p><p>My prediction was soon confirmed.</p><p>‘Demon Lord Castle Status.’</p><p>With a ‘tirring~’, a sound rang in my head.</p><p>White words appeared before me.</p><blockquote><p>Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle</p><p> Type: Cave</p><p> Title: None</p><p> Rank: F</p><p> Special Effect: None</p><p> Military Force: None</p><p> Citizens: None</p><p> Wealth: 100 Libra</p><p> ※The castle is in ruins. Neighborhood kids refer to this place  as a fun playground. This place is in danger of being conquered at any  moment. Urgently open the ‘Employment Tab’ and hire forces.</p></blockquote><p> Is that so. At the very most, this was it.</p><p>I was hoping that perhaps even a little  amount of forces remained, but there really was nothing left. This  really was nothing more than a kiddy playground.</p><p>I was grateful that I had any wealth at all.</p><p>‘Libra’ was the name of the common currency  in &lt;Dungeon Attack&gt;. There was a time I was bored and decided to  compare currencies. In Korean money, 1 libra was 500,000 won<em>(TL note: 433USD)</em>.</p><p> Right now I had 100 libra.</p><p>In other words, I was given about 50,000,000won<em>(TL note: 43,335 USD)</em>.</p><p>How far could I get with this.</p><p>After searching through all kinds of functions in the game, I finally found what I wanted.</p><p>‘Employment Tab’.</p><p>A half transparent list appeared before me.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Monster</td><td>Stamina</td><td>Attack</td><td>Defense</td><td>Price</td></tr><tr><td>Slime</td><td>F</td><td>F</td><td>E</td><td>4 Libra</td></tr><tr><td>Weak Fairy</td><td>F</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>8 Libra</td></tr><tr><td>Goblin Deserter</td><td>E</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>12 Libra</td></tr><tr><td>Weak Golem</td><td>D</td><td>D</td><td>C</td><td>20 Libra</td></tr></tbody></table><p>……</p><p>So weak.</p><p>And damn expensive.</p><p>No matter how you looked at it, 200,000 won  for a slime was overcharging. In this day and age, you could buy two  fair cows with 200,000 won. Not calves, but cows. How could a useless  slime be twice the price of a cow used for farm work?</p><p>Most likely, the price went up because of the game difficulty.</p><p>‘Tsk. This messes up my plan……’</p><p>At first, I was thinking of pouring my  wealth into hiring a unit of monsters. Even if I spent all my money and  hired 8 goblin deserters, the chances of them winning against the  adventurers was uncertain.</p><p>No, these men might be more pathetic than I think. Was it worth testing out?</p><p>‘Status’.</p><p>I muttered in my mind while staring at an adventurer.</p><p>[You do not have sufficient affection with this person.]</p><p>[Only the simplest stats will be viewable.]</p><p>With the same ‘tirring~’ sound from before, a window appeared above the adventurer’s head.</p><p>I assumably needed more affection points to see more precise information.</p><blockquote><p>Name: Riff Hoffman</p><p> Stamina: E</p><p> Attack: E</p><p> Defense: E</p><p> Affection: 6</p></blockquote><p>“Uhg”</p><p>I unintentionally let out a groan.</p><p>A little bit stronger than a goblin.</p><p>He was certainly weak, but that small  difference was a big matter to me. The other adventurers had about the  same stats. Even if I hired 8 goblins, they were far off from being able  to overwhelm these adventurers.</p><p>What to do.</p><p>There was no certainty in winning or losing.  Should I leave it to fate and take a gamble? To risk my life on a  gamble. That wasn’t my style. I preferred to raise my chances in winning  before going into a fight.</p><p>As I was in deep thought.</p><p>“We’re almost there!”</p><p>An adventurer shouted.</p><p>We were almost at the Demon Lord’s room.</p><p>“Hah. Why is this cave so big?”</p><p>“This is your first time coming to a Demon  Lord’s Castle. This is nothing. Normally these castles are full of  traps, so you have to tread incredibly slowly.”</p><p>The adventurers were chatting rowdily.</p><p>There wasn’t much time left. I had to make a decision soon.</p><p>Should I make it up by numbers and hire a  lot of slimes or fairies? Or, should I hire the strongest golem and  attack them by surprise? No. Both sides were far away from being  ‘certain victory’. If I allow myself to get in danger……</p><p>……Okay. This was the best option.</p><p>“Alright! Let’s go in.”</p><p>The adventurers poured into the room.</p><p>I bit my lips forcefully. Skin tore and blood flowed into my mouth.</p><p>If I had to rate my chances, then 70%. It  was pathetically low for something that had my life on the line.  Regardless, this was the utmost best.</p><p>I thought I was free once my father had died. I ran away hoping that I could live a peaceful life.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I got this far and you’re telling me that my  life was in danger again? To fall into a strange world and to tell me  to die without a single clue on what’s going on just because I had  become a Demon Lord? Don’t make me laugh!</p><p>Who cares if I’m a Demon Lord or something.  If there was a fellow that was trying to end my idle life, then I’ll  face them with no mercy. I will live no matter what……</p><p>♦</p><p>The Demon Lord’s room was a miserable wreck.</p><p>“Is there really treasure here?”</p><p>This place had most likely been plundered  many times already. Be it the bed or the chairs, the wooden furniture  were toppled over. It was hard to believe that there was a treasure  vault in this mess.</p><p>The captain, Riff, spoke.</p><p>“Your honor. Hurry up and open up that Mooirakkutoung or whatever.”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“Yes. Do not worry. I know that…… ack!”</p><p>I fell over while getting off the new guy’s back. I had twisted my ankle on purpose.</p><p>The adventurers reacted in panic.</p><p>“Ouch, are you okay?”</p><p>“Hey! Support him properly!”</p><p>“I-I’m okay. I’m alright.”</p><p>I stood up by myself with trembling legs.  The core point of acting was to obtain sympathy. If I borrowed another  person’s shoulder here, there’s the danger that they might see me as an  annoying wounded person.</p><p>I went to a wall while limping.</p><p>“Everyone, it is here.”</p><p>“Ah? All I see is a wall.”</p><p>“There’s a carving here only visible to  Demon Lords. If you place your hand on the carving and recite a specific  spell, then the vault will open.”</p><p>I lied without missing a beat.</p><p>The adventurers had intrigued expressions on their faces.</p><p>“Oh. Magic, huh.”</p><p>Beginner adventurers were ignorant in  regards to magic, like these adventurers who originally used to be  simple farmers or lumberjacks until now. The majority of these men most  likely haven’t seen proper magic in their entire life. If I told them it  was magic, then they’d simply nod and say “Is that so.”.</p><p>I made a request while displaying a pained face.</p><p>“Everyone. I’m sorry, but please move 10 steps away from me.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Only a Demon Lord can release the magic on  the vault. It will never unlock if even one outsider is nearby. If a  mistake were to happen, a defense mechanism could occur and you may be  hurt.”</p><p>“A defense mechanism, you say……”</p><p>“Worst case scenario, the treasure could be sealed forever.”</p><p>The adventurer’s face immediately turned grave.</p><p>As if I had just threatened to take their  treasure away from these humans turned money grubbers, the effect was  instant. Following my instructions, all 10 men stood in a line and  backed off.</p><p>One step. Another step.</p><p>The adventurers spoke after taking exactly 10 steps.</p><p>“How is that. 10 steps, just like you asked.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>These adventurers were sincere in useless places.</p><p>I was in awe, but expression wise, I continued to smile firmly.</p><p>“That’s exactly 10 steps. No more and no  less. There is a good chance that you all will not be affected by the  magic at that range. Well done.”</p><p>The adventurers grinned broadly.</p><p>“This is nothing.”</p><p>“I’m a bit of a perfectionist.”</p><p>I think they wholeheartedly believed that.</p><p>I’m struck with wonder whenever I meet  humans as self-confident as these guys. Humans, with this kind of brain,  were able to be separated from Homo sapiens sapiens.</p><p>Wouldn’t this be considered a kind of miracle?</p><p>I turned my back towards them and faced the wall.</p><p>“I shall now begin casting the spell. Everyone, please be silent!”</p><p>Obviously, there was no carving on the wall. The fact that the treasury was here was a blatant lie, like I’ve been saying.</p><p>But there was something I did believe in.</p><p>‘Demon Lord Castle’s Wealth.’</p><p>White words appeared on the smooth wall.</p><blockquote><p>Demon Lord Castle’s WealthWithdrawal Amount: xxx LibraTotal Balance: 100 Libra※Warning. If you withdraw too much at once, you may go bankrupt.</p></blockquote><p>This was one of the game functions I found earlier.</p><p>Thanks to the Demon Lord’s right, I could  withdraw funds wherever and whenever I wanted. It’d all be over if I  took out a bunch of coins here.</p><p>However, it’d be troubling to simply hand over the money.</p><p>A small performance.</p><p>Add some spice and gift-wrapping.</p><p>Taking in a deep breath— as seriously as I could, I shouted.</p><p>“Mahabanyabaramildashimgyeong……!”</p><p>…… ……</p><p>…… I honestly did shout this seriously.</p><p>It was back when I wrote Minlakdong on the ground. The conversations were certainly being translated, but the adventurers could not exactly pronounce the word ‘Minlakdong’. Hence, all the conversations weren’t being translated cleanly.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Gwanjajaebosal Hengshimbanyabaramildashi  Jogyeonohoengaegoeng Doilchaegoaek, Sarija, Saekbeuligoen Goengbeulisaek  Saekjeukshigeong Geongjeukshisaek Soosanghaengshik Yeokbooyeoshi……” <em>(TL note: If you’re genuinely curious as to what he’s chanting, it’s the famous ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Sutra\">Heart Sutra</a>‘ in Manayana Buddhism. Don’t expect me to translate it because even professional translators are struggling to do so.)</em></p><p>For example, words that couldn’t be  translated into this world’s language; chemical formulas like H2O or  professional terms like ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_deformed\">Deformation</a>‘,  could not be translated. Furthermore, words that I perceived as proper  nouns weren’t translated either. This was the reason why the adventurers  had no idea what Minlakdong meant. Things like  Mahabanyabaramildashimgyeon were the same.</p><p>Despite the fact that Minlak had the meaning  of ‘citizen happiness’, it was not converted. Even  banyabalamildashimgyeon could be interpreted, but it wasn’t to these  men.</p><p>The reason behind this was because I wasn’t saying these words with the meaning in mind.</p><p>Thus.</p><p>“T-That’s the demon language?”</p><p>“I have no idea what he’s saying but it sounds menacing.”</p><p>“I feel like something is making my heart tremble……”</p><p>To the adventurers, it would really seem like I was shouting an unknown incantation.</p><p>“Beobgoensang Beulsaenbeulmyeol Beulgeuboojeong Boojeunbeulgam Shigo Geongjeongmoosaek……”</p><p>While I used my mouth to keep chanting, I used my eyes to earnestly stare at the window.</p><p>I had to slowly time when to take the money out.</p><blockquote><p>Demon Lord Castle’s Wealth</p><p> Withdrawal Amount: 79 Libra</p><p> Total Balance: 21 Libra</p><p> ※Warning. If you withdraw too much at once, you may go bankrupt.</p></blockquote><p>I decided to take out about 8/10 of all I had.</p><p>It’d probably be suspicious if I withdrew a solid amount of 80, so I purposely set it to 79.</p><p> “Ajaeajae Baraajae Baraseunajae Moji Sabaha—!”</p><p>I lifted my arms up and yelled gloriously.</p><p>As I said the last line of the incantation, I thought the word ‘withdraw’ in my mind.</p><p>Then, silver coins formed in mid-air and fell.</p><p>“S-Silver! It’s silver!”</p><p>“How much is all that!?”</p><p>“It really was magic!”</p><p>5 silver coins equalled 1 gold coin. In  total, 395 silver coins rained down. The average farmer in &lt;Dungeon  Attack&gt; made around 15 silver a year.</p><p>Meaning, this was a jackpot for the adventurers.</p><p>“Oh! Ooooooh……!”</p><p>Silver coins were forming a heaping pile on the floor.</p><p>80% of my entire fortune was pulled out in an instant.</p><p>Their bodies were probably burning up from seeing so much money rain in front of them.</p><p>“Hey. You guys haven’t forgotten that we’re splitting this up equally for each of us, right?”</p><p>“Of course. Whoever tries to change their word now, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>The adventurers stared at the silver with bloodshot eyes.</p><p>The smell of greed flowed from their mouths.</p><blockquote><p>Demon Lord Castle’s Wealth</p><p> Withdrawal Amount: xx Libra</p><p> Total Balance: 21 Libra</p><p> ※Warning. If you withdraw too much at once, you may go bankrupt.</p></blockquote><p>The final coin dropped.</p><p>Like a bunch of wolves, the adventurers tried to rush forward.</p><p>What impatient men.</p><p>Aiming for when they took their first step— I raised my hand quickly.</p><p>“Do not approach yet! You’ll be cursed!”</p><p>“C-Curse?”</p><p>Hearing the disturbing word, they came to a halt.</p><p>I fell to my knees</p><p> and as if I was under some intense pain, I started to groan.</p><p>“Gaaaah……!”</p><p>I contorted my face as much as I could.</p><p>Foam overflowed from my mouth.</p><p>The adventurers were startled by the sudden situation.</p><p>“W-What’s going on!? What’s going on, your honor!?”</p><p>“It’s black magic! He’s been cursed by black magic!”</p><p>The men stumbled back in fear.</p><p>In order to make my performance seem more  real, I collided my already broken ankle on the ground. Pain vibrated  through me. An agonizing scream ruptured from my lungs.</p><p>“Aack— Kuaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</p><p>I cried out while grabbing my eye sockets.  While doing so, I took a glimpse at the adventurers from between my  fingers. Their faces were pale. There were even some men trying to make a  run for it. My greatest performance was working.</p><p>“Oh God. That’s terrible……”</p><p>“Just what’s happening? Are you okay!?”</p><p>One of the braver adventureres tried to approach me, but I hurried prevented him from doing so.</p><p>“S-Stay back! This is the consequence for  using black magic…… If you get close, aaagh, you could be affected as  well…… kuh, gaah!”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Hiiih!”</p><p>The man stopped promptly.</p><p>The adventurers had watched silver coins  appear out of thin air. To them this was magic. They could do nothing  but believe that whatever I told them was magic was true.</p><p>The adventurers started to mutter to each other.</p><p>“By any chance. Did he tell us to take 10 steps back…… for our sake?”</p><p>“It was his chance to get rid of us……”</p><p>Yes.</p><p>This was the response I wanted.</p><p>If my plan was going to work, I had to raise  their affection rate towards me as high as possible. And what would  leave the strongest impression on someone?</p><p>When someone sacrifices oneself to save them.</p><p>Like right now.</p><p>“Huaaaaaaak!”</p><p>I writhed in pain more intensely.</p><p>“W-Wait. He’ll die at this rate! Are you sure we shouldn’t stop him!?”</p><p>“You idiot, did you not hear him say it was black magic? Have you not heard the stories of people dying by some weird curse!?”</p><p>“Dail is right. The only thing we can do is…… regrettably, wait here patiently.”</p><p>“Damn it.”</p><p>Some of the adventurers cursed angrily.</p><p>At this point, notice windows popped up continuously.</p><p>[Your devilish performance has captivated the people.]</p><p>[Adventurer Riff’s affection went up by 15.]</p><p>[Adventurer Dail’s affection went up by 13.]</p><p>[Adventurer Zed’s affection went up by 19.]</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>As intended, a sharp increase in affection.</p><p>With my nails, I ripped some skin off of my  face. Red blood spurted out. It was incredibly painful, however this was  light compared to the weight of my life. My screams continued on for a  while.</p><p>Moments later.</p><p>I let out a ragged breath.</p><p>“It’s, okay now…… You can collect the coins now…… it’s fine.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>“E-Ehem.”</p><p>They’re attitude had completely changed.</p><p>The wolves that desperately wanted to  swallow up the coins earlier were nowhere to be seen now. The  adventurers were all afraid that the coins might still be cursed.</p><p>“You go first and check.”</p><p>“No no. You know the saying ‘respect your elders’, the oldest should go.”</p><p>The men presented the chance to go first to one another, but never taking it themselves.</p><p>Having enough, the party leader stood forward.</p><p>“Screw it! You’re all cowards! I don’t know  why you have anything down there. I should probably chop it off with my  axe. You were all confident in conquering a Demon Lord’s Castle, but  look at you all now!”</p><p>The leader of this party, Riff, roared.</p><p>“And Dail, you one-eyed person. You’ve been with me for 2 years now. What are you doing hiding with those greenhorns!”</p><p>“Well, this is my first time witnessing black magic.”</p><p>“Oh, look at you still making excuses. What’s a fellow, who’s a senior, doing cowering like a newbie!”</p><p>“Then you go first.”</p><p>“Yeah. The captain should go first.”</p><p>The other men nodded in agreement.</p><p>Riff twitched his nose.</p><p>“I was going to even if you didn’t tell me, you cowards.”</p><p>Riff walked proudly towards the pile of silver.</p><p>The adventurers whispered to one another while watching their captain march.</p><p>“He’s being prideful again.”</p><p>“He’s got his nose bent plenty of times while acting proud, too.”</p><p>“What’d you say!?”</p><p>Riff glared at them. His bear-like face looked like some vandal when he scowled. The men avoided his glare and whistled.</p><p>Riff turned back to the silver pile.</p><p>“Hoo… hoo…… Here I go!”</p><p>He reached out and grabbed a coin.</p><p>It was obvious, but absolutely nothing happened. There was no black magic in the first place.</p><p>Not knowing this fact, Riff exaggeratedly laughed mockingly at the others.</p><p>“Look at that! Didn’t his honor, Demon Lord,  already say that there was no curse now? Idiots, I should just cut your  dicks off now! Kekeke!”</p><p>“……”</p><p>The adventurers glanced at each other awkwardly.</p><p>Watching the chain of events from a distance, I couldn’t help but mockingly smirk.</p><p>I wonder if it was because I had acquired  enough affection, but I could see more detailed information on Riff’s  status window. There, I could see the mental state of Riff that he  wasn’t voicing.</p><blockquote><p>Name: Riff Hoffman</p><p> Race: Human</p><p> Job: Lumberjack(B) Adventurer(F)</p><p> Reputation: Dust in the galaxy</p><p> Leadership: E \\ Might: E \\ Intelligence: F</p><p> Politics: F \\ Charm: F \\ Technique: E</p><p> Affection: 21</p><p> Current Mental State: ‘Ah, shit. I thought my liver was going to fall out. My legs are still shaking……!’</p></blockquote><p>It was a bluff.</p><p>Well done scolding your subordinates when  you were also trembling in fear. The other adventurers, not having  realized this, were scratching the back of their heads.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“T-Then let’s go as well.”</p><p>“Mm. The captain did prove it to us.”</p><p>“Lesser people like us should follow his lead.”</p><p>The men approached the pile carefully.</p><p>“Hah. You sorry batch of men.”</p><p>Riff was sneering but he didn’t try to stop the other adventurers from approaching in particular.</p><p>Following after, the other adventurers  started feeling up the coins greedily. In case someone tried to take  more coins than they should, the adventurers watched each other  intently.</p><p>“If there’s a single coin in your backpocket, I’ll beat you up personally.”</p><p>“Split everything equally. Don’t try to be a thief!”</p><p>Quite a lot of time had passed before they had finally counted all the coins.</p><p>Riff snorted with satisfaction.</p><p>“Hu. In total there’s 386 silver coins.”</p><p>Huh.</p><p>I narrowed my brows a bit. I’m certain I had taken out 395 silver coins.</p><p>Where’d the remaining 9 go to.</p><p>“……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>A couple of the men were fidgeting nervously.</p><p>……So they couldn’t hold back and managed to  steal some. Despite the fact that they kept threatening each other,  there were some people who were able to successfully steal in the end.  How marvelous.</p><p>“Alright. Let’s fairly split up 38 pieces each.”</p><p>“Then there’ll be 6 remaining. What about the change?”</p><p>“What about it? I, the captain. will take it.”</p><p>Riff shamelessly declared.</p><p> The other adventurers booed and sent jeers.</p><p>“Captain was the one that said to divide equally no matter what, in the first place!”</p><p>“That’s dirty. Dirty!”</p><p>“Shut up you swines! If it wasn’t for me, you cowards wouldn’t have approached the money at all.”</p><p>“That’s that and this is this!”</p><p>“What’s that and what’s this! Speak clearly!”</p><p>Beginner adventurer party had met internal conflict so soon.</p><p>It was like an argument between kids.</p><p>After a lively debate, it was decided that Riff would take the change.</p><p>“Tsk tsk. A bunch of narrow-minded bigots.”</p><p>Riff grumbled. It seemed that he got  offended that the others were so against conceding the leftover 6 pieces  of silver to him, the captain. I couldn’t tell who the narrow-minded  person was.</p><p>Anyways, it was starting to become time.</p><p>“Everyone.”</p><p>I opened my mouth.</p><p>“I’m sorry to disturb you all while you’re busy, but I have something to tell you all.”</p><p>“Hm? Oh, what is it?”</p><p>Their response was half-hearted. The  adventurers were occupied shoving their portion of the coins into their  bags or shoes. Some of them were even loosening their belts to shove the  silver into their underwear. It was quite dirty.</p><p>“I apologize, but the event we had feared has occurred. Just now, other adventurer parties has invaded the castle.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Their hands froze immediately.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I am a Demon Lord. There’s a magic system  set up that notifies me whenever someone invades my castle. A moment  ago, I heard a bell ring in my head.”</p><p>The adventurer’s eyes opened wide in panic.</p><p>“D-Demon Lord, is that true?”</p><p>“Yes. Unfortunately, this is the truth.”</p><p>“Isn’t there the chance that you heard wrong?”</p><p>“……Of course, there is the possibility. I  too am hoping that I heard wrong. However, I’ve heard the same bell ring  4 times this month. To be mishearing things now is very unlikely.”</p><p>I confessed to them with a sad expression.</p><p>The men were visibly shaken. While I acted,  there were times that I felt like I could see other people’s emotions in  the shape of a thick cloud. I was touching that cloud here and there  and forming it to my will.</p><p>“T-The numbers. Do you know how many people?”</p><p>“Not exactly. I could take a guess by counting the rings……”</p><p>I bit my lips, giving off the feeling that the number was hard to reveal. Seeing this, the adventurers grew more anxious.</p><p>“I don’t care if it’s an estimate! Just tell us how many there are!”</p><p>“……The bell rang 3 times in a row.”</p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p>“The bell rings once every 10 people who invade my castle. In other words, at the very least, 30 people has invaded.”</p><p>Thirty people.</p><p>An amount of people too large for the people in front of me to handle.</p><p>The adventurers became pale.</p><h3>Chapter 2: A Devil Steps on Stage (Part 3)</h3><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Adventurer, Cowardly Looter, Riff Hoffman<p> Empire Calender: Year 1505, Month 4, Day 4</p><p> Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>I didn’t like the situation at all.</p><p>According to what the Demon Lord had said, there was another group of  invading adventurers in the cave. The number was at the very least, 30.  This was no joke…… damn it.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I had picked weaklings on purpose to bring here. People with skill  demanded more money. In the case of my adventurer group, the treasure in  the vault was to be split fairly, but the bounty on the Demon Lord  Dantalian was all mine for the taking. If I wanted to establish this  kind of agreement, I could only gather these run of the mill  adventurers.</p><p>Shit. I should have just spent more money and hired skilled people.  No, even if I did, 30 people was too much. They wouldn’t be able to  handle this amount. My insides were strangely bitter……</p><p>“We could win if we hold out in this room!”</p><p>“Are you insane. It’s 30 people, thirty! We’ll be overwhelmed!”</p><p>“If you’re going to fight, then leave me out. I never had the hobby of killing myself. I’ll get out on my own.”</p><p>“Hah! This filthy coward! Finally showing your true colors!”</p><p>The men were split into two groups and arguing.</p><p>People who wanted to stay here and fight, and people who wanted to  escape. They had been arguing for over 10 minutes now, but they were yet  to come together like they did before.</p><p>Honestly, I didn’t have a good idea either. Obviously we should run,  but there was no certainty that we wouldn’t meet the other adventurer  party on the way out. That was the problem. Crap, what do I have to do  to get out safely……</p><p>……wait.</p><p>Think about it the other way around.</p><p>If we had to face them then face them. It’s fine as long as I get away safely. It’s not my problem if the others live or die.</p><p>I took out a map and checked. There were 3 routes from here to the cave entrance.</p><p>I approached the Demon Lord and asked him.</p><p>“Hey, your honor. How many paths are there that leads from the castle entrance to here?”</p><p>“There are 3.”</p><p>As expected, the map was accurate. Even the Demon Lord confirmed it.</p><p>“Do you know which route they’re coming from?”</p><p>“I’m sorry, but I can’t tell that far……”</p><p>The Demon Lord spoke with an ashamed expression.</p><p>“No, it’s fine. I’m grateful you even told me about the invaders.”</p><p>I lightly patted the Demon Lord’s shoulder. Once doing so, he lowered his head graciously.</p><p>I said this before, but this guy really has no guts. Even though he’s  a Demon Lord, he’s been speaking respectfully to a human like me. Does  he have no pride? To say it nicely, he knows his place. What more would  he get then get hit if he showed defiance. Kekeke.</p><p>At that moment, the Demon Lord looked straight at my eyes. He  appeared weirdly serious so I couldn’t help but become stiff in  response.</p><p>“Sir Riff. I’m fated to be captured by adventurers no matter what.”</p><p>“Hm? So?”</p><p>“Then, I at least wish to choose a safer path. You all did not kill  me the moment you saw me. Just that alone makes me wish to be on your  side. Please live, and make a wise decision.”</p><p>Aha.</p><p>He was begging for me to save his life.</p><p>I started to feel familiarity with the little one in front of me.  Pride wasn’t needed if it meant survival. I thought so as well.</p><p>“Hehe. You sure know your stuff, your honor. Okay, don’t worry. If  you believe in me then you will definitely get to the city safely.”</p><p>“Thank you. Thank you very much……”</p><p>It was cute because he looked like a pet, lowering his head over and over again like that.</p><p>I tapped the Demon Lord’s cheek while chuckling. It was a sign of affection. It’s okay to be happy.</p><p>I shouted at the men that were still arguing.</p><p>“Attention!”</p><p>They shut their mouths. I guess they realized that there was no point  in fighting each other. They glared this way with bloodshot eyes.</p><p>“We’re retreating.”</p><p>“But captain!”</p><p>“Listen up you greenhorns. Are you not able to see properly because  of the coins in your pockets? Who do you think you are? You guys only  faced 2 goblins on our way here. How do you plan to face 30 adventurers  with just that ability?”</p><p>I gave them a menacing look.</p><p>I’ve grown up being told that I had a vulgar looking face. There was no one here that was brave enough to face me properly.</p><p>“Stop dreaming. You’ll die without being able to do anything.”</p><p>“……but captain. There’s no guarantee that things will go well if we escape.”</p><p>The person to speak was the one who was silent and didn’t get involved in the argument.</p><p>This bald one-eyed man was a reasonably skilled senior.</p><p>“What are you going to do if we unluckily meet the enemy? We could at  least hold out here and fend them off, but there’s no answer if we meet  them out there.”</p><p>“I know, you bastard. That’s why we’ll split up and go down three separate paths.”</p><p>“Three separate paths?”</p><p>“There’s three routes from here to the castle entrance. Pick your path and run that way.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>A moment of silence passed.</p><p>The men creased their brows.</p><p>“……captain. Surely you don’t mean.”</p><p>“Yeah. One of the three groups will meet the enemy no matter what. However, oppositely, the other two groups will live.”</p><p>“That’s just an escape-goat!”</p><p>The one-eyed man retorted loudly. He must have been seriously enraged  because the veins on his neck were visible. Tsk, he’s a good guy but  the places he got serious at made it tiring.</p><p>The other guys complained as well, saying things like “That’s not right!” and “We’d rather all die together!”.</p><p>A bunch of peerless fools they were. You all don’t know what death  means. That’s why you’re easily able to say that you’re willing to die  together.</p><p>……but there was no benefit in speaking truthfully here. Let’s talk  while mixing lies here and there. What? I’m only honest to myself. I  never said that I was honest with other people as well, did I?</p><p>“Shut up you punks! My job is to send as many people as I can back home!”</p><p>They twitched. Would you look at that. They got scared just because I  shouted a bit. There’s a limit to expectations if they thought they  could fight 30 people with this attitude.</p><p>“You guys all have a family, right? Man’s pride? That’s good.  Companionship? That’s also nice. But what’s the point of worrying about  all that if we end up dead, huh? Who’s going to take responsiblity of  your families?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“What about your kids? What about the fellow village people working in the fields in our stead? What about your wives?”</p><p>A complicated silence fell upon them.</p><p>As expected, there’s nothing as persuasive as family. Even though I was illiterate, I at least knew how to deal with people.</p><p>“The one’s who are alive will take responsibility for the families of the one’s that have fallen.”</p><p>I made my words a notch softer and concluded.</p><p>“We have no more corners to back up to, you punks. Think about your  families and the village. Everything else is useless. Forget it all and  only think of your families……”</p><p>They lowered their heads.</p><p>Of course. If you thought with reason then my suggestion was the  best. It was just the fact that they had to sacrifice someone  else’s life that was hard to accept. They had to cut off that part of  their minds.</p><p>The adventurers separated into 3 units.</p><p>4, 3, 3 people each.</p><p>“Let’s get going now.”</p><p>I ordered sternly.</p><p>Which route met with the enemy, that all relied on luck. Well, if you  asked if it really was entirely based on luck then that wasn’t right.</p><p>I purposely placed the Demon Lord in another group. If the enemy had a  magical energy detecting device then it would react to the Demon Lord.  The target will naturally go to him. In other words, he worked as bait. I  was good at using my head in this kind of places.</p><p>Alright. Time to genuinely run away.</p><p>Please die, my close comrades.</p><p>So that way, I can live.</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 4, Day 4</p><p> Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle</p></h4><p>The adventurers patted each other’s shoulders lightly. They then departed down their own path out of the three.</p><p>“Go and die, you dogs.”</p><p>“You’ll be the one dying. I’ll make sure to enjoy your wife in your stead.”</p><p>The adventurers swearing at each other was simply a coping method.  They knew that if their farewells were heavy then their feet would be  heavy as well.</p><p>The leader of the unit I was with spoke.</p><p>“We should get going as well.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>I was on the back of the new guy again.</p><p>The unit I was with specially had 4 members. It was because they had  extra luggage to carry, which was me. The person that was temporarily  acting as leader was the one-eyed bald man. The person who refuted  against Riff earlier.</p><p>“……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Gloomy footsteps echoed throughout the cavern.</p><p>Not a single person said a word. The shadow of people reflected on  the cavern wall by the torches. The shadows wavered like a mirage.</p><p>When Riff suggested to divide the group into three, I honestly wanted  to run around in joy. That was the idea I was originally going to  propose. I was afraid of a group of 10 adventurers together, but I  didn’t fear a group split up into 3’s and 4’s.</p><p>They were foolish.</p><p>Riff suggested to split up in order to raise his chances of survival  as much as possible, however, he was mistaken from the premise. He  completely believed the words of a Demon Lord. Normally, adventurers and  Demon Lords were supposed to be hostile to one another, but they had  easily trusted my information.</p><p>Were they being careless, or did I really appear to be that pitiful.  If it was the latter, then that was a relief. It was proof that my  acting skills weren’t rusty yet. The price to pay for being careless  shall be huge, Riff.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I stared at the empty space in front of me.</p><p>A half transparent map was being projected.

There were  pathways that connected the routes at a couple of places, but only I,  who had the system map, knew this.

They trusted  the Demon Lord Dantalian when they should have been hostile against him.  They had not only lowered their fighting prowess, but they were  mentally unprepared as well.</p><p>The optimum requirement for a surprise attack.</p><p>But the reason why I was hesitating for a moment…… who knows.</p><p>If I hired monsters and attacked the adventurers here, then I’d be crossing the Rubicon River<em>(TL note: point of no return)</em>. For the adventurers to die or for myself to die. Only one of the two future existed. There was no going back.</p><p>“……”</p><p>The inside of my mouth felt dry.</p><p>It was impossible to return once I’ve made my decision.</p><p>I was realizing the weight of my choice.</p><p>Then, the second choice box since coming to this world had appeared.</p><p>[1. Annihilate the adventurers like this.]</p><p>[2. Be taken by the adventurers like this.]</p><p>…… just as I thought. I figured out in what situations these choices appeared.</p><p>When my life was on the line, or when other people’s lives were on  the line. These boxes popped up in those immensely vital points, as if  telling me to really think about my decision carefully.</p><p>Regardless, my obvious choice was option number 1.</p><p>A hopeful future for a Demon Lord captured by humans did not exist.  Even if the adventurers decided not to kill me, it was useless. The  adventurers will sell me over to the city in order to gain the bounty,  and then my head will be displayed on the town square to show off to the  people about how well the cutting off of my head was done.</p><p>So thus, I selected number 1.</p><p>I’ll kill every last human before me.</p><p>‘Hire Weak Golem.’</p><p>[You’ve hired a Weak Golem.]</p><p>[Would you like to summon Weak Golem?]</p><p>My entire fortune of 21 Libra shrunk down to a single Libra in an instant.</p><p>At the same moment, the cave floor was covered in light.</p><p>“H-Huuh?”</p><p>“What’s going on!?”</p><p>The adventurers panicked.</p><p>The light caused by the summoning circle lit up the dark cavern  entirely for a brief second. The moment everyone’s gaze was focused on  the circle, I bared my teeth.</p><p>CRUUUNCH! <em>(TL note: If you know a better word to portray biting down onto something, be my guest)</em></p><p>It sounded like a plastic bag was being ripped. However, it was  something much more raw than a plastic bag. With my teeth, I had bit  down strongly onto the ear of the newbie adventurer who was carrying me.</p><p>“Kuaaaaaah!”</p><p>The adventurer cried out and flailed his body. I, who was on his  back, fell to the floor. I was already preparing a safe way to fall, so  the impact wasn’t too big.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“J-Jack!? What happened! What’s wrong!?”</p><p>“Guh, ah, ear! My ear!”</p><p>The vision that was focused on the summoning circle moved to here.</p><p>With a genuinely fearful expression, I pointed towards the other side.</p><p>“Everyone! Behind you! Look behind you!”</p><p>In the spot I was pointing at was an arm made of stone reaching out from the earth.</p><p>The stone arm grasped the ground and, like a demon coming out of Hell  itself, a bulky body emerged. A disturbing ‘grrrrdduh, grduh’ sound  resonated. It was the sound of boulders grinding against each other. The  adventurers stared at the summoning magic with their mouths agape.</p><p>“M-My God……”</p><p>“Raise your shields! Take out your swords!”</p><p>The adventurers were moving about in confusion. Nevertheless, the  bald one-eyed man, proving that he wasn’t just the sub-captain by name,  gave orders to his comrades. However, your enemy wasn’t only the golem  that had suddenly appeared.</p><p>“Mmmm……!?”</p><p>I jumped back onto the back of the new guy and covered his mouth. The man opened his eyes widely.</p><p>His eyes looked like they were shouting, ‘What are you doing!?’.</p><p>He had a dagger on his hip that I had been eyeing since the  beginning. I pulled his dagger out and brought it down on his throat.  Once, twice, thrice, and finally for the fourth time. I didn’t even give  him the opportunity to resist.</p><p>“Eub, pbb…… huppbb……”</p><p>The newbie screamed, but the sound was muffled by my hand making it only sound like a moan.</p><p>Soon the groans became bright red blood and drenched my hand stickily.</p><p>“Uuh……eub……”</p><p>I silently stared down at the new guy’s eyes.</p><p>Finally, his body went limp.</p><p>This took 8 seconds.</p><p>The other adventurers had no idea that the newbie was murdered behind them.</p><p>Thus, I had committed my first murder, but I didn’t have time to get  sentimental. The situation was still dire. I immediately hid the dagger  in my clothes and turned my head.</p><p>“∎∎∎∎∎∎—!”</p><p>Right on time, the golem had climbed out fully.</p><p>As if celebrating the fact that it had escaped from the stifling  underground world, the golem raised its head and let out a long roar.  The ceiling of the cave shook, making the stalactites tremble as well.  Even if it was called ‘weak golem’, at this moment, the one dominating  this space was that monster.</p><p>This was a monster.</p><p>This was a demon.</p><p>It looked so much different from humans and that atrocious outer appearance was enough to plant fear into the hearts of humans.</p><p>“Hiiiik……!”</p><p>The adventurers shrunk back. One man’s arms were trembling so much  that he had dropped his torch. Since the light from the summoning circle  was gone, the cavern had returned back to being dark— that raised the  adventurer’s fears to no limit. The light from the torch gave the cave a  reddish glow, giving only slight glimpses of that massive body in the  distant darkness.</p><p>People who used to do farm work for a living in their hometown.</p><p>These people may have been realizing for the first time.</p><p>That adventurer was a discreditable occupation that normally faced against mythical terrors like this.</p><p>“E-Euuuuh……”</p><p>The three adventurers gathered together. This was an instinct  implanted into humans, to unite together with their comrades when facing  a large beast. However, in this situation that instinct had made them  commit a grave mistake.</p><p>“∎∎, ∎∎∎∎∎∎∎—!”</p><p>As big as the golem was, its footsteps were slow.</p><p>If the adventurers had spread out instead of grouping together, then  they may have been able to deal with the golem. But these men lacked  experience. Experience of fighting various types of demons.</p><p>Like a tank, the golem advanced towards the men. Its feet came down  with a thud and shook the ground. The tremors violently jolted the  darkness.</p><p>The adventurers could do nothing but hold up their wooden shields.  Their entire body had become rigid. They should probably be complimented  for not having run away on the spot.</p><p>“T-This person is dead!”</p><p>I intensely shook the already disordered adventurers by another level. I was holding up the new guy’s chest and shouting.</p><p>“He suddenly fell! It’s black magic! Someone unbeknownst to me is assaulting everyone! Quickly, please get away!”</p><p>“What……”</p><p>A moment of unrest.</p><p>However, faltering for even a second while a golem was right in front  of you, that was more than enough time to bring about a tragic end.</p><p>The adventurers’ attention was dispersed. Aiming for that chance, the  golem swung its fist. The target was the bald one-eyed man. As the  person responsible for this unit, when he had heard that the new guy had  died, he had turned this way for a brief second. The golem’s heavy  stone fist smashed into his body just like that.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>There wasn’t even a shout.</p><p>His skull was crushed and he was met with instant death.</p><p>The wooden shield which the village blacksmith had made was of no use.</p><p>“………… uh, aah?”</p><p>One step late, the survivors reacted.</p><p>Honestly, to say that it was a proper reaction was miserable.</p><p>One adventurer, as if giving up on all hope, fell to his knees. The  other adventurer decided oppositely and was about to escape. Tossing  away his torch and sword, he got rid of anything that was weighing him  down and ran.</p><p>It’d be troubling if I missed one person here.</p><p>“This way! Run this way!”</p><p>“Uh, ah! Aah!”</p><p>Giving me an obscure response, the adventurer ran towards me. It was  like the behavior unconsciously taken by people during a fire. When told  to escape this way, they ran towards that direction recklessly.</p><p>I pulled the man close and whispered.</p><p>“Calm your breathing. Golems lack good eye-sight and hearing. If you  quietly hide in the corner of the cave, then you’ll be safe. You can  believe me. I’m an expert on demon characteristics.”</p><p>O-Okay. I understand.”</p><p>“Now, follow after me and breathe slowly. One. Two. Hoo.”</p><p>“Hoo…… hooo.”</p><p>“Good. That’s it. Inhale and exhale slowly.”</p><p>The adventurer settled his breathing. I grabbed his hand tightly. It  was a well-known fact that people became relaxed when a professional  grabbed their hand during a crisis.</p><p>“One……”</p><p>The adventurer breathed while following my command. I stealthily pulled out the dagger.</p><p>“Two……”</p><p>It was at the moment he was going to breathe out. With the blade, I  slit his throat. Calm breathing could never come out of his mouth ever  again. Blood filled his gullet and his breathing couldn’t become words.  The only sound to come out were gurgles and coughs. Shortly after, the  man met death.</p><p>At about the same time the man stopped breathing in my arms, the golem had taken care of the other remaining person.</p><p>The golem simply raised its foot and stomped the last man. The human  body was a lot harder than I had expected. A man’s body wasn’t crushed  immediately.</p><p>A terrible scream came from the adventurer each time the golem’s feet  came down. The screams grew weaker as the stomping continued. At a  certain point, the screams itself had stopped completely. Only the sound  of bones breaking echoed lowly. The sticky substance attached to the  golem’s foot was probably the man’s guts.</p><p>It was a gruesome conclusion.</p><p>“……Hoo.”</p><p>I sat back against the cave wall.</p><p>Exhaustion weighed down on my entire body. The heat had yet to  subside. I didn’t know that warmth could be so unpleasant. On the other  hand, the cold coming off the wall was good. It was the perfect  temperature for me right now.</p><p>Half the temperature.</p><p>Half.</p><p>“……It’s not over yet.”</p><p>I muttered to myself.</p><p>I felt tired as if I had stayed up for four nights in a row.  Regardless, I had several manuals carved into my skull. Carved like the  ancient hieroglyphics in Egypt. The instincts, that was implanted into  me since I was a child, whispered to me.</p><p>‘Clean up everything.’</p><p>If you don’t want your crime to be caught henceforth.</p><p>‘End what you’ve started.’</p><p>If you don’t want malice and apprehension to remain.</p><p>“……”</p><p>I calmly knitted my brows.</p><p>My pounding chest slowed down.</p><p>My breathing settled and my composure returned.</p><p>Humans were beasts of instincts.</p><p>If you create an instinct for every possible situation, then no  matter when and where you are, you’ll be able to cope like a beast of  prey.</p><p>There was no need for trial and error.</p><p>In that sense, my father’s words were correct.</p><p>In truth, I, ‘whose life was in danger’ responded by ‘getting rid of  the humans who endangered me’ with no hesitation whatsoever. You could  say it was thanks to that I could stay alive. <em>(TL note: He means during the process of killing, not the instant before summoning the golem)</em></p><p>“At any rate, father is still…”</p><p>Even after death he was haunting me like a bothersome ghost.</p><p>I stood up and went through the pockets of the corpses. This was not stealing.</p><p>I’m only taking back what was mine. After going through all the inside pockets and shoes, my fortune went up to 34 gold coins.</p><p>It was enough to summon one more golem and a goblin as well.</p><p>“Map Window”</p><p>The inner map of the cave popped up in mid-air.</p><p>I wonder if it was because they were moving cautiously, but the other  two groups hadn’t gotten that far ahead. I decided to go and wait at  the locations that they’ll arrive at. Using a shortcut unknown to the  adventurers, I got ahead of them.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>♦</p><p>“Shit, why is there a monster left……!”</p><p>The second battle commenced.</p><p>The plan was very simple.</p><p>The golem was sitting in a dark corner of  the tunnel. As much as its body was made of stone, in a dark tunnel, it  was impossible to tell the golem apart from the other boulders. So thus,  right when the adventurers were passing by, I launched a sudden attack.</p><p>The surprise attack worked nicely.</p><p>On the first hit an adventurer’s head was  destroyed. Another adventurer was then grasped by the golem’s hand, it  then crushed the body with ease.</p><p>It took merely 40 seconds for the unit of three to shrink down to only a single man standing.</p><p>“Keuuk!?”</p><p>I stabbed the back of the remaining adventurer who was focusing on only the golem.</p><p>This time it wasn’t a dagger but a long sword. The blade fully pierced through his chest.</p><p>“It can’t, be……”</p><p>The adventurer looked down at his chest. He  had an expression on his face as if he couldn’t believe that a sword was  going through his chest.</p><p>The adventurer twisted his face, bright red bloodshot eyes glared at me.</p><p>“Demon Lord, you bastard…… betrayed us……!”</p><p>“……”</p><p>I pulled the long sword out.</p><p>The man fell to the floor. I wonder if the  blade had sliced his lungs. His last breath just now was wheezy. Like  the sound of air leaking out of a punctured bicycle wheel. That was the  man’s last scream.</p><p>“Betrayal, huh.”</p><p>You were wrong.</p><p>I never betrayed you men. On the contrary,  it was the opposite. You men were the invaders and this was Dantalian’s  home. If you had not charged in here, then you wouldn’t have had to die.</p><p>“Haah.”</p><p>I went through the pockets of the corpses.</p><p>Red blood was stained on the copper and silver coins. I held these coins tightly.</p><p>As long as I was trapped in the role of the  Demon Lord Dantalian, other adventurer parties will come to capture me  in the future. In preparation for that day, I have to collect war funds.</p><blockquote><p>Demon Lord Castle’s WealthWithdrawal Amount: xx LibraTotal Balance: 58 Libra</p><p> ※Warning. If you withdraw too much at once, you may go bankrupt.</p></blockquote><p>I deposited the money into the castle vault.</p><p>If you included the 20 Libra that I had  spent on summoning the golem, then I was almost back to having the  original amount I had started with. Now everything will be over once I  got rid of Riff’s group. I climbed up onto the golem’s shoulder and  headed towards the next stage.</p><p>In a moment, I arrived at the entrance of the castle.</p><p>I made the golem lie in wait and stood in a dignified stance at the cave entrance.</p><p>Around 20 minutes passed. From the other side of the tunnel a group emerged. It was Riff’s unit.</p><p>“Hm? If it isn’t your honorable Demon Lord.”</p><p>Riff recognized me and creased his brows.</p><p>“How come you’re by yourself? Where are the others?”</p><p>I did not answer.</p><p>I wonder if they had noticed that the  atmosphere was grim. The group stopped walking on their own. Well, if  you had eyes then it was normal to feel like something was off. My  entire body was fatigued.</p><p>“Your honor. I asked where the others are.”</p><p>Riff asked again. Impatience started to show  on his face. ‘Everyone is alright. They left to do something real  quick’. He was probably hoping for this kind of response. I cut down  that hope mercilessly.</p><p>“They’re dead.”</p><p>“…… eh?”</p><p>“They’re all dead. Not just the group that  was with me. Excluding your group, all seven men have died. They’re  probably enjoying a nice beer together in the after life.”</p><p>A voice so cold came out of my mouth that it  even surprised me as well. It wasn’t simply cold, but a strong feeling  of mockery was mixed in as well. You could tell by the contorting look  on Riff’s face.</p><p>“Don’t tell me…… the enemy attacked on both sides?”</p><p>“Sir Riff. Please stop acting the fool when  you already understood what has happened. If what you said was correct,  then there’s no chance for me to be standing here like this.”</p><p>I chuckled.</p><p>“There are no invading enemy forces anywhere in the castle. That was a lie. A big fat lie.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Do you still not understand? It was purely a strategy made to kill each and every one of you.”</p><p>The adventurer’s faces changed dramatically.</p><p>From welcoming to suspicion. From suspicion to rage.</p><p>But this wasn’t enough. My goal was to raise their rage into wrath. I twisted the edges of my mouth and grinned widely.</p><p>“It’s all thanks to you, Riff. I’m honestly  grateful that you believed me so easily. Adventurers trusting a Demon  Lord. The main character to make this unlaughable comedy a success was  not me, but you.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“It was all a trick……?”</p><p>“Yes. I killed all 7 people with these hands.”</p><p>I took out the dagger I had hidden within my clothes. You could see the blood distinctively on the blade.</p><p>“This person and that person were all  nothing but fools. Each time I stabbed their necks with this dagger,  they each reacted by opening their eyes wide. Did you all honestly  believe that a Demon Lord like myself would obediently cooperate? That’s  why beginner adventurers who lack experience are laughable.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“The newbie’s reaction was especially  amazing. He looked at me and muttered ‘It can’t be’ even though blood  was pouring out of his throat. So I politely stabbed him one more time.  His wife back home should be relieved. She’s better off not having such a  foolish hu—”</p><p>[Adventurer Riff’s affection went down by 21.]</p><p>[Adventurer Zed’s affection went down by 23.]</p><p>[Adventurer Zack’s affection went down by 20.]</p><p>The affection of the three adventurers  instantly fell to 0. And amongst those three, someone had thrown a stone  at me as hard as they could. With a thuck the stone  hit my forehead. The rock contained a lot of killing intent. He probably  intended to finish me with that. But, unfortunately, the aim was  slightly off so after scratching a bit of my forehead it had flown  passed me.</p><p>“—That’s not right.”</p><p>I’m sorry to say, but that was your last  chance to hit me. If you had tossed it a bit better I may have died. You  may have received the happy ending of ‘the adventurers defeated the  Demon Lord’. It might have been a very slim chance but that opportunity  very much existed.</p><p>“Not the side of my head, but here.”</p><p>I tapped the center of my forehead with my finger.</p><p>“∎∎∎∎, ∎∎∎∎∎—!”</p><p>It was at that moment the golem attacked  them from behind. The golem, that was crouched like a boulder a second  ago, reached out its arms.</p><p>It was the final battle.</p><p>Please do your best to resist, Riff. You’re  the first human to push my head down onto the ground in the past 10  years. I’ve been vowing to repay you back fully for what you did for  quite a while now.</p><h4>▯Adventurer, Cowardly Looter, Riff Hoffman<p> Empire Calender: Year 1505, Month 4, Day 4</p><p> Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle</p></h4><p>Impossible. This is impossible!</p><p>What is that man? He’s giving off a completely different atmosphere  compared to earlier! Where’d the man who kept lowering his head like a  small fry disappear to? Who is that man over there who’s grinning so  shamelessly……!?</p><p>“Kuaaaaaaah!”</p><p>Shit, another one got done in.</p><p>It was especially bad that the golem had come from behind. Before we  could even react someone was already dead. We tried our best to fight  with just us two but…… damn it.</p><p>The weakness of inexperienced adventurers was revealed here. The  other remaining adventurer was getting too worked up so he wasn’t able  to back me up properly. This half-wit. Excitement will only become  poison during combat. How has he not shoved this basic information into  his skull yet!</p><p>…… no. The person who brought these greenhorns to the Demon Lord’s  castle was me. I was blinded by greed and ended up making a mistake. At  the time I didn’t think it was wrong. I kept telling myself that it was a  smart idea. In the end, did my foolishness bring upon this  misfortune……?</p><p>The words the Demon Lord had said while he was being cynical was  right. We were too careless. Shit. But I don’t plan to die easily, you  know!</p><p>Despite everything, I’m still a professional when it comes to  surviving. I’ll struggle disgracefully to the very end if I have to.</p><p>“I-I surrender!”</p><p>I tossed away my shield and sword.</p><p>The man before me uttered a “Oh?”, and raised the corners of his  mouth. That smile came incredibly naturally to him. That was probably  his true-self; cold-blooded, merciless, and more sinister than anyone  else.</p><p>“Aren’t you being quite well-behaved, Captain Riff.”</p><p>“I will do whatever you want if you spare my life. I-I really did not  know. That your honor was such a terrifying person. Please, I beg for  your forgiveness.”</p><p>I did my best to display a pathetic expression.</p><p>It was obvious what was going on in your head, Demon Lord.</p><p>You had won and I had lost. The positions were suddenly switched. The  Demon Lord who was pretending to be the loser until now was finally  able to reverse the situation.</p><p>You’re probably thrilled and excited. It’s clear that you’ll want to  enjoy this as much as you can. To take delight in your victory by  humiliating me as you please.</p><p>“I was dull and foolish. I apologize, honorable Demon Lord! Please  feel pity for this lowly human and grant me mercy! I will never step  foot in your honor’s territory ever again……!”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I slammed my forehead against the floor repetitively.</p><p>I didn’t care if this method was loud and pathetic. It was better if  it was noisy. The most important part was to satisfy the other person’s  pride. Sure enough, the Demon Lord grinned.</p><p>“I see. If you wish to apologize then do so by cutting off your own hand.”</p><p>“M-My hand?”</p><p>“Yes. Do so and I will let you live. I won’t cut your arms or legs off either.”</p><p>The Demon Lord chuckled.</p><p>“Think carefully. In truth, I’m the one at a loss in this trade.”</p><p>It was the exact words that I had tossed in ridicule at the Demon  Lord before. Those words came right back at me like an arrow. I grinded  my teeth.</p><p>But this was a chance. I would be able to take out a weapon without having to worry about drawing suspicion.</p><p>“Of course. I will more than gladly cut my hand. Thank you for forgiving me. Thank you very much, honorable Demon Lord……”</p><p>I took out the dagger that was attached to my hip.</p><p>While lifting up the dagger in the air as if to bring it down onto my  hand, I stood up just like that and charged at the Demon Lord.</p><p>You naively showed an opening, Demon Lord Dantalian!</p><p>“Haaaaaaaaaa!”</p><p>I ran while crying out. I’m sorry to say but I’m gifted at  controlling people’s psychology. It’s your own fault for getting  overconfident and lowering your guard just because you were so close to  winning.</p><p>The Demon Lord may have been holding a long sword, but it was too  late to get into a proper stance. The golem behind me probably won’t  make it on time. Even if the front or the back moves, I’ll be the first  to stab this blade into the damn Demon Lord!</p><p>I put more spirit into my body and thrust my dagger forward and—</p><p>My body staggered right before I could reach him.</p><p>“Uhiik!?”</p><p>I ended up letting out a questionable noise. My foot had suddenly  stopped. When I looked down I saw a bluish slime wrapped around my right  foot.</p><p>I was unable to withstand the momentum I was running with a second  ago and fell forward. I groaned as I desperately tried to take my foot  out of the slime. It wouldn’t budge.</p><p>1 second, 2 second had passed before my mind started catching up to  what had happened. Since when did he prepare something like a slime?  Don’t tell me, from the very beginning? Are you telling me that he knew  from the start that I was pretending to surrender?</p><p>Then, something large crushed my body.</p><p>“Kuuaah!”</p><p>The golem had slammed its fist down onto my lower body. My legs were  obviously destroyed and my waist along with them. I could vividly feel  the sensation of my bones breaking. The intense pain made everything in  front of me start to blur and fade.</p><p>Something was flowing out of me. Was it my blood? It could possibly  be my innards. Whatever it was, this was my end. I had never experienced  something like dying before, but for some reason I had the strong  feeling of ‘I will die here’.</p><p>“Damn, it……”</p><p>I vomited blood. I couldn’t even muster the strength to talk. A  blurry shadow came into my fading vision. The shadow moved, then, a  blade stabbed into my throat.</p><p>To make sure that I was dead at this point.</p><p>Isn’t that a bit too much for a life that was already destined to die?</p><p>Before everything went dark I was able to see the other person’s face  for just a moment.

It was the aftereffect for running my brain on full throttle for 3  hours straight.</p><p>After receiving a mysterious survey in my email I was dropped into a  different world. It was a shock that I had become a Demon Lord in a  world where a hero was the protagonist, but to also discover that I was  the weakest Demon Lord, Dantalian. Without being able to properly figure  out what was going on, I had to face a group of adventurers and was  eventually able to kill them all.</p><p>This all happened in 3 hours. It was obvious that my brain would be so exhausted. Thank you for going through the effort, <em>my pretty brain(TL note: He says this in English)</em>.

      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><h4><strong>Chapter 3: Faceless Disease (Part 1)</strong></h4><p>A memory from long ago.</p><p>It was around the time I had started elementary school.</p><p>“Father. Why didn’t you marry only one girl?”</p><p>At that time I had learned that monogamy was common sense in nearly every country. Our country was the same. In other words, it meant that my growing environment&nbsp;being unusual was confirmed on a national level.</p><p>“Son. You probably won’t understand, but there are&nbsp;good women around the world, albeit rare. And even more rare than that are good men. If a good woman and a good man were&nbsp;to meet, then it’s inevitable that they’ll have sex.”</p><p>My father declared shamelessly.</p><p>As he always would.</p><p>“Oh? So for father, you were able to meet 5 of those so-called&nbsp;‘rare good women’?”</p><p>“That’s because I did a lot of good things in my past life.”</p><p>“Maybe I should try believing in Allah next time.”</p><p>During that time, I would go to&nbsp;church every week and would constantly pray for a lightning to strike down upon my father’s head. I’m not sure why, but my father was still fine. Perhaps it was because God was running an international business. He didn’t think&nbsp;the desperate plea of a 8-year-old child was important. Thus I decided to not get involved in God’s business industry.</p><p>Give and take.</p><p>There was always a background for the reason why I had become an athiest.</p><p>“My shrewed son. Keep in mind your father’s words.”</p><p>“Although I think that the reason why my personality became so rotten is 80% your fault, father. What is it?”</p><p>“If you’re lucky then you will meet good women. You’ll know they’re good&nbsp;just by looking at them. No matter what you do. Never. Never let those women&nbsp;go.”</p><p>“Couldn’t you have at least used the singular term instead of the plural, father? Thanks to that all I hear is a very trash-like statement.”</p><p>“Trash, huh…… oh well.&nbsp;Son. Be prepared beforehand. No matter what you choose, you will live a life more harsh than I.”</p><p>“Why would I? My personality is already more mature than you, father.”</p><p>“Because you’re more competent than I am.”</p><p>He raised the corners of his mouth.</p><p>“People who are overly competent won’t marry just anyone. In the end, they’ll search for a companion who can understand them. The only person capable of understanding a competent man is an equally competent woman. Then what will happen?”</p><p>My father raised an index finger.</p><p>“Since two competent people are together they’ll most likely achieve great things. Once you reach a higher position, you’ll end up meeting another woman as competent as you are. You’ll be able to understand one another and then it’ll become 3 people together.”</p><p>He raised his middle finger.</p><p>“Now that there’s 3 you’ll get to an even higher position. Once at the top you’ll take a look around and find another competent woman. Now there’s 4. And before you know it, it’ll increase to 5.”</p><p>He finally lifted up his ring finger and pinky.</p><p>I was dumbfounded and retorted back.</p><p>“……In my entire life, I had never heard nonsense as nonsense as this. I thought it was impossible for pregnancy to happen between a dog and a human, but when I look at you, father, I worry that I might be the one to have gotten passed that impossible barrier as a miracle and was born.”</p><p>“You are more of a Devil than I am. This dad of yours limit was 4 women. That’s as far as I could get. Regardless, I look forward to see how far up you’ll go.”</p><p>“Garbage of a father, I will not go out with anyone—”</p><p>I looked him straight in the eyes.</p><p>“And even if I do end up doing so, I will only date a single person. I will never&nbsp;do something like cheat and hurt the person that is important to me.”</p><p>“That’s not a surprise, coming from you.”</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>Annoyingly.</p><p>Even as his son, it was a cool smile.</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 4, Day&nbsp;18</p><p>Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle</p><p>Life was beautiful.</p><p>To the point that the people who think themselves as nihilistic should admit as well&nbsp;that life was so beautiful.</p><p>Following the setting in Dungeon Attack, Demon Lords are a clump of magical energy. All bodily functions are handled by magic. In other words, if you don’t eat or sleep, thanks to the magical energy, your mind will still be fully active.</p><p>There was no problem even if I rolled around on my bed for 4 days straight.</p><p>I didn’t even have to work for food.</p><p>Isn’t this the very life that NEETs all around the world had dreamed for?</p><p>I’d like to borrow this position and make a declaration.</p><p>Demon Lords are the best.</p><p>Demon Lords, hooray.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Here’s to you, Demon Lords</p><p>“……Your highness, Dantalian.”</p><p>There was a time I had actually thought&nbsp;all&nbsp;that.</p><p>I turned my head slowly because of the abrupt voice.</p><p>I was currently lying down on my bed, so if I wanted to turn my head then I had to flip my entire body as well. It was an incredible amount of wasted energy. As if I was looking at the Minister of Environment who had just finished reading the report on electricity consumption during the Summer, I looked at the person with an accursed gaze.</p><p>“Why are you calling&nbsp;me?”</p><p>“Today is the deadline. This time, no matter what, I will have your highness pay back the debt and interest.”</p><p>There a female,&nbsp;who wore her hair in two braids, stood.</p><p>She looked around the age of a girl who had just graduated high school. Not matching her outer appearance, her face was incredibly&nbsp;void of emotions. Like a straggler returning&nbsp;from&nbsp;war would often be like, the girl looked as if she had long ago burned off all the fuel that was in the thing called emotions.</p><p>Should I call it&nbsp;dryasdust?</p><p>That was this girl’s normal expression. It had been half a month since I had first met her, but I had never witnessed something even remotely close&nbsp;to a smile from her. I’m starting to suspect that she has some sort of illness. Perhaps forever-on-her-period syndrome. That sounded like a sickness that existed.</p><p>The girl spoke.</p><p>“The 100 Libra that you borrowed three months ago. If you include this month, then the interest alone is 96 Libra. I will be taking a total of 196 Libra.”</p><p>“I’m saying it again, but I have never borrowed money from you.”</p><p>I dug the inside of my nose with my pinky.</p><p>“How am I supposed to repay money that I had never borrowed? Give up.”</p><p>“That is wrong. Your highness has most definitely received a loan from the Keuncuska&nbsp;Firm<em>(TL note: This needs a better name 쿤쿠스카)</em>. Please look at this bond of debt. Your highness’ thumbprint is certainly here.”</p><p>The girl took out a scroll parchment from her bag.</p><p>In a vintage handwriting, a contract was written on the parchment.</p><blockquote><p><strong>IOU</strong></p><p><strong>100 Libra Coins(40% interest every month)</strong></p><p>Rank 71st, Demon Lord Dantalian, has been loaned the above written&nbsp;amount of gold.</p><p>The interest must be paid on the&nbsp;<strong>10th of every month</strong>, and the principal is due by&nbsp;<strong>Year 1505, Month 4, Day 11th.&nbsp;</strong>In the case that the interest is overdue, the creditor may at anytime demand all of the principal and interest. The debtor, Demon Lord Dantalian,&nbsp;during that time shall&nbsp;not display opposition.</p><p>Year 1505, Month 2, Day 1</p><p>Rank 71st, Nameless Demon Lord, Dantalian</p><p>Keuncuska Firm, Exclusive Consultant, Lapis Lazuli</p><p>Hereby vow to Hermes and Hades.</p></blockquote><p>“As you can see.”</p><p>The girl displayed to me the parchment and spoke&nbsp;methodically.</p><p>“The deadline date was originally the 11th of this month. A week has already passed. Your highness had requested for us to delay it for a week. Your highness. The time limit is up.</p><p>“Did I— do that—. I don’t remember—.”</p><p>“It is of no use to feign ignorance.”</p><p>I was going to pretend to be indifferent&nbsp;but this girl sternly cut me off.</p><p>“I can not delay the deadline any further.”</p><p>“Can&nbsp;you not&nbsp;push it back another week?”</p><p>“That is impossible.”</p><p>Immediate reply.</p><p>“Didn’t your highness say the same thing last time? Delaying the deadline may be possible once, but two times in a row will not be&nbsp;allowed.”</p><p>A spiteful girl.</p><p>She was the type of person who could kill someone without blinking.</p><p>♦</p><p>A week ago.</p><p>This girl had suddenly visited my castle while introducing herself as an employee of some firm. These type of guests were usually unwelcomed back in my original world, and&nbsp;sure enough, she had abruptly pushed a debt bill on me and pressured me to pay up.</p><p>“A debt……?”</p><p>“That is correct, your highness.”</p><p>The girl lowered her head and bowed. It was like she was a veteran maid.&nbsp;Her every movement was well-disciplined.</p><p>Except the fact that I couldn’t even feel the least bit of respect towards me. She gave off the feeling that she had only bowed because greetings were a core part in social interactions.</p><p>Well, I was only a Demon Lord in name. I was still something that would compare to a ricefish, Dantalian. I’m grateful she displayed even the smallest bit of etiquette towards me, on the contrary, I should be the one that should be bowing. I had no complaints.</p><p><em>(TL note:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://animalia-life.com/data_images/japanese-rice-fish/japanese-rice-fish2.jpg\">Ricefish</a>)</em></p><p>“Your highness had taken a loan of 100 Libra from our firm, Keuncuska, around this time two months ago. Since the day to pay the interest has arrived, this lowly one has come in person to meet your highness.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“My god……”</p><p>I closed my eyes tightly.</p><p>I didn’t think that Demon Lord Dantalian’s position could get any worst than this, but it seems that I had been overly optimistic.</p><p>I had put my life on the line and was able to repel the adventurers but now a personal moneylending business had arrived at my doorsteps. Economic aggression after an armed protest. It was an actual standard colonial policy. It was admirable. If need be, I wanted to applaud this clean diplomatic method. If the person directly involved wasn’t me, that is. Fucking hell.</p><p>“Your highness?”</p><p>While I was up to my neck with despair, the girl had tilted her head. She most likely&nbsp;had been an acquaintance of Dantlian&nbsp;for quite a while now. She might notice that I was suddenly acting strange compared to before.</p><p>For now, in order to figure out&nbsp;the person’s name, I muttered in my head.</p><p>‘Status.’</p><blockquote><p><strong>Name:&nbsp;</strong>Lapis Lazuli</p><p><strong>Stamina:&nbsp;</strong>E rank</p><p><strong>Power:&nbsp;</strong>D rank</p><p><strong>Defense:&nbsp;</strong>F rank</p><p><strong>Affection:&nbsp;</strong>0</p></blockquote><p>So her name was Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>I composed myself to have a serious expression. It would be&nbsp;fitting&nbsp;to lie from here on. Since the affection was at 0, it’d only be appropriate to speak a bit coldly to her.</p><p>“Lazuli. There’s a secret that I must tell you.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Eh?</p><p>I don’t know why, but the girl had slightly raised her eyes. It seemed like she was surprised by what I had said. I didn’t really say anything strange yet, and yet her reaction was weird.</p><p>“What’s the matter?”</p><p>“My apologies. This one&nbsp;had never expected in their&nbsp;wildest dreams that your highness would remember this one’s&nbsp;name. Normally, your highness would refer to this one as crossbreed, low-life, larva, or prostitute……”</p><p>Dantalian was a piece of trash that went beyond expectation.</p><p>I cleared my throat and changed the subject.</p><p>“Ehem. Bearing that in mind, this is an issue which involves that as well. You may not know this, but exactly one week ago a group of adventurers had&nbsp;invaded here. While I was retaliating against said&nbsp;adventurers I had hit my head against the ground. Then what do you know. I found out that&nbsp;I had lost parts of my memory.”</p><p>I then pointed at my leg.</p><p>“My leg was also&nbsp;seriously injured and had only just recently healed a couple of days ago. If things went wrong then I would have died. Honestly speaking, other than knowing that your name is Lapis Lazuli, everything else is rather&nbsp;fuzzy and vague.”</p><p>“…… Is that so.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli gazed at me with eyes containing suspicion.</p><p>Of course, there was no way she would easily believe the words of a man who had suddenly claimed to have&nbsp;lost his memories. Nevertheless, I stayed brazen. For a moment, an atmosphere as if we were trying to analyze one another flowed.</p><p>It seemed Lapis Lazuli had understood in her own way and bowed her head once again.</p><p>“To serve your highness would be a privilege for this one. If there is anything that this one can do to help your highness, then say so and this one shall do her utmost to help.</p><p>“Good. Then I’d like to request something immediately.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“…… Could you possibly delay the deadline a bit.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli blinked.</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“I currently do not have the money on me. I will most definitely pay within this week, so please grant me a bit more time. Okay? I beg of you.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Her gaze became cold.</p><p>Ten to one, she had&nbsp;most likely misunderstood and assumed that I had claimed to have lost my memories in order to delay the deadline. Sadly, I did not have the ability to fix the misunderstanding……</p><p>Lapis&nbsp;Lazuli was a level-headed woman.</p><p>If I was allowed to be more subjective, then she was a devilish woman. She did not consent to delaying the deadline by even a week. Despite my plea, she only gave&nbsp;me 2 days.</p><p>From that day on for a week, I played a game of cat and mouse with that loan shark.</p><p>On the first day.</p><p>“Your highness. The interest has already been pushed back by two months. The original loan was 100 Libra, but the interest alone is already at 96 Libra. Please make your payment.”</p><p>“In the first place, is it not&nbsp;ridiculous that the compound interest is 40% every month!? That’s excessively expensive!”</p><p>I exclaimed while walking down one of the cavern paths.</p><p>In one corner of the cave there was an underground lake. Interestingly, the lake was&nbsp;heated just like a spa. My hobby was to go there every day and spend my time peacefully enjoying&nbsp;the heat of the water enveloping my body. However, that moneylender had solved her lodging problem in this cave and kept bothering&nbsp;me. Thanks to that, I couldn’t properly enjoy my simple hobby.</p><div></div><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Keuncuska Firm or whatever they’re called, I’ll make a formal complaint! This kind of interest rate is both economically and logically an evil influence to this society!”</p><p>“That is why this one had warned your highness since the beginning. That, unless it was a desperate situation, to never&nbsp;borrow money from our Keuncuska Firm. But the one to had kept pushing for the loan two months ago was none other than your highness, Dantalian.”</p><p>“No. That wasn’t me who borrowed that money……!”</p><p>I clenched my teeth and roared.</p><p>Why did I have to pay back the money that someone else had borrowed?</p><p>It was irrational. Ah, irrational beyond measure. Life being beautiful was, as expected, a delusion. Life was dirty and cheap. I cursed at my fate of possessing a Demon Lord.</p><p>Demon Lords were the worst.</p><p>Demon Lords die.</p><p>“I apologizes, but this one does not understand what your highness means.”</p><p>“I’m saying that it was some half-wit named Dantalian that had taken that loan……!”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli looked this way&nbsp;as if she was looking at something rotten.</p><p>Isn’t your highness that Dantalian, is what her eyes were asking me. Yes. People other than myself probably wouldn’t be able to understand what I meant. That was obvious……</p><p>“If it truly is too difficult, then there is also the option to declare bankruptcy.”</p><p>“I have to be concerned about bankruptcy right from the start, huh. Ahaha.”</p><p>Hello, people of the nation.</p><p>This is exemplary citizen turned Demon Lord.</p><p>When talking about Demon Lords, you’d think they’d command an army of demons and mercilessly devastate humans, but for some reason&nbsp;I seemed to have absolutely nothing.</p><p>I thought it was unfair that I had almost died to adventurers as soon as I had opened my eyes, but to now also tell me that I had to repay a debt? Where should I go to deal with this unfairness? The cops? Court? Or maybe a mental hospital?</p><p>I just wanted to comfortably live the remainder of my life as a NEET in the corner of my house. Peacefully. Without causing any fuss. Were you blocking me off from even this small desire? Was the world messing with me?</p><p>I wanted to kill myself……</p><p>“Your highness. It is not embarrassing to not have the ability to pay back the loan. However, the thing that is embarrassing is the attitude of trying not to repay the debt. What does your highness mean by having lost your highness’ memories? How could a great Demon Lord, like your highness, resort to such a childish excuse.”</p><p>“I really am going through partial memory lost!”</p><p>“…… haaa. Of course.”</p><p>“You really do have the knack of making people upset, huh!?”</p><p>The corners of my mouth twitched.</p><p>“Anyways, give me a week. Just a week. Once a week has passed I will do whatever you tell me to.”</p><p>“This one shall wait one more day.”</p><p>“So frugal……!”</p><p>Second day.</p><p>It was morning and&nbsp;as I was getting up from my bed,&nbsp;as if she had been waiting for me, Lapis Lazuli entered the room. I should add that I had the habit of sleeping naked.</p><p>Based on a logical conclusion, when Lapis Lazuli had invaded my quarters, I was&nbsp;sporting a new fashion style of not even wearing my underwear. Thus, as soon as I saw her I had let out a scream.</p><p>“Get out! I said get out!”</p><p>“Your highness. The interest……”</p><p>“I’m not wearing anything below right now!”</p><p>“That is fine. This one does not care for your highness’ body.”</p><p>“I care!”</p><p>With all my strength I threw a pillow at her.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli didn’t even move an inch and&nbsp;allowed herself to be hit. Of course, the attack didn’t work. Her face was still calm and emotionless.</p><p>“This one will say it again, but declaring bankruptcy is also a fine&nbsp;idea. If your highness&nbsp;can’t possibly pay off the debt then please do put into consideration this option.”</p><p>“…… I’ll hear you out.”</p><p>I spoke while slowly getting dressed.</p><p>I was getting a headache by this loan shark.</p><p>“What will happen if I declare bankruptcy?”</p><p>“For starters, our firm will claim all rights to the Demon Lord castle.”</p><p>They’ll seize my home.</p><p>A beautiful hell of a life was already being spread before me.</p><p>“After that, our firm will make&nbsp;<strong>a few requests</strong>&nbsp;to your highness. All your highness has to do is oblige.”</p><p>“So I’ll be downgraded to your firm’s puppet……”</p><p>“My apologies, but that is so.”</p><p>I had done this kind of work before, so I knew about it well.</p><p>Like a large company supporting a poor politician and using them as&nbsp;a chess-piece. In this world, it was a big firm taking advantage of a Demon Lord in poverty.</p><p>“Look around, Lazuli. I am a Demon Lord with nothing.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I told her earnestly.</p><p>“It wouldn’t even be fun to use me as a puppet.”</p><p>“That is alright. There’s an infinite amount of economical uses by just being a Demon Lord. Our firm executives are putting&nbsp;a lot of expectations on your highness, Dantalian.”</p><p>“You really are quite honest!”</p><p>“Unfortunately, the only product that your highness can purchase from this one is honesty.”</p><p>But you don’t have anything so you can’t buy anything, anyways.</p><p>Was the nuance that she had plainly put into her words.</p><p>I disliked her.</p><p>I really disliked her.</p><p>I disliked her to the point that I wanted&nbsp;to step on her foot.</p><p>“……your highness?”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“Your highness is right now stepping on this one’s left foot.”</p><p>“I consider it a boast that my thoughts and actions line up.”</p><p>“It hurts.”</p><p>“You don’t look like you’re in pain.”</p><p>“I’m sorry…… but I actually feel more pleasure from it.”</p><p>“Were you perhaps a pervert!?”</p><p>“Despite this one’s looks, there is succubus mixed into this one’s blood.”</p><p>“Was it not you who stated that all succubus being perverts was just a bias last time we met! You&nbsp;yourself said it!”</p><p>“Please throw away the bias that all biases are nothing but bias.”</p><p>“Why are you the one acting high and mighty……!”</p><p>“I’m sorry, but I’m actually a very competent person.”</p><p><em>(TL note: She stops using ‘this one’ here.’)</em></p><p>“Annoying! You’re seriously annoying!”</p><p>“I am a half-breed of a human and a succubus. My birth is&nbsp;so low that I&nbsp;am&nbsp;considered an outcast. Born an orphan, I roamed the bottom of the streets for 20 years. However, I was able to succeed in life with my ability alone. Now I am currently a white-collar worker for the biggest firm in the demon continent, Keuncuska. Adding to that, I am now here with your highness Dantalian as your exclusive consultant.”</p><p>“You really are competent……!?”</p><p>“That is correct. It is on a completely different level to your highness who was born a Demon Lord. But also, your highness is a Demon Lord and is yet to have achieved anything, but this one was able to climb up this far by her&nbsp;power alone.”</p><p>“You’re competent but as expected you’re annoying as well! What’s with that.”</p><p>“My apologies. Since this one is always honest to your highness.”</p><p>“If that’s honesty, then the world is better off if everyone was a liar.”</p><p>I wonder why.</p><p>This person wasn’t insulting me but Dantalian, but for some reason I feel offended. The girl shooting spiteful remarks at me with no emotions stabbed into my chest.</p><p>“I will make myself clear now. I do not plan to become&nbsp;someone’s puppet.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli nodded.</p><p>“Then please pay the debt.”</p><p>“Sorry, but I don’t have money either. Tsk tsk, it’s quite the shame. I want to give you the money but it seems my pockets are empty so I can’t! Haha! Ahahaha!”</p><p>“……”</p><p>In truth, there was 80 Libra hidden under my bed in the Demon Lord’s Quarter.</p><p>That was the money that I had risked my life to take back from the adventurers. Like I’d give the money to some frugal forever-on-her-period succubus.</p><p>“Your highness.&nbsp;Do you truly have the will to pay back the debt?”</p><p>“Indeed. I’m a man who’s constantly burning with will. Aah, what a tragedy. I sincerely want to give you the money, but alas, since I am penniless I am unable to do anything. Restrictions. These restrictions.”</p><p>“Then work to pay it off.”</p><p>“……Eh?”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli’s right hand glowed brightly.</p><p>A light pink magic circle formed for a moment before shortly after Lapis Lazuli was holding a pickaxe in her hand.</p><p>A pickaxe.</p><p>It was something you’d see a rough worker using in a mine.</p><p>“……Why are you giving this to me?”</p><p>“Does your highness not know? Compared to other areas, Demon Lord castles have a high concentration of magical energy. Perfectly, your highness’ castle is in the form of a cave, so if your highness picks any deposit and mines from it, then your highness should immediately get magic stones. Magic stones with a large amount of magical energy in them can sell for a very high&nbsp;price.”</p><p>“Are you perhaps telling me to become a miner and work?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Are you serious.”</p><p>I unintentionally spoke with honorifics.</p><p>It was such a shock that I had forgotten for a moment that I was a Demon Lord.</p><p>“Did&nbsp;your highness not say&nbsp;that you were overflowing with will?”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli handed the pickaxe to me.</p><p>I stared blankly at the wooden stick with another iron stick attached to it.</p><p>“Now all your highness has to do is emit that will.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“……”</p><p><strong>CLANG!</strong></p><p><strong>[You have extracted 1x Iron Ore.]</strong></p><p><strong>CLANG!</strong></p><p><strong>[You have extracted 1x Iron Ore.]</strong></p><p><strong>CLAANG!</strong></p><p><strong>[You have extracted 1x Iron Ore.]</strong></p><p><strong>CLANG……</strong></p><p><strong>[You have extracted 1x Iron Ore.]</strong></p><p><strong>CLAAANG………</strong></p><p>And thus, on the third day.</p><p>I glared at Lapis Lazuli ferociously.</p><p>“—I declare bankruptcy.”</p><p>“But only one day has passed.”</p><p>“It was a miracle that I was able to last 30 minutes of manual labor!”</p><p>I tossed the pickaxe as far as I could.</p><p>My body was screaming because of my sore muscles. As a person who was aiming to become a peerless house corner dwelling NEET, a large amount of labor was too tough for me. There was also no profit. Even if I swung the pickaxe all day, the most money I could earn was&nbsp;merely a single silver coin.</p><p>“How could I continue to do something like this!”</p><p>“It was just that your highness was boasting so much that this one had high&nbsp;expectations.”</p><p>“Isn’t the efficiency the worst!? The efficiency! If I made 1 silver every day, then even if I worked for one whole month, all I’d make is 6 gold! The interest alone is about to be 80 Libra this month and that’s 10 times the amount I’d make. How do you expect me to waste my time mining!”&nbsp;<em>(TL note: 5 silver = 1 gold, A gold coin is referred to as a Libra. Silver is just silver)</em></p><p>“……”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli had abruptly stopped talking.</p><p>Her blue pupils had grown slightly bigger. For some reason, I think she was surprised at me. It was incredibly rare for Lapis Lazuli to show an emotion.</p><p>That was strange.</p><p>Nothing that I had said just now was weird. From what I could tell, a reason to be surprised didn’t exist either. I wonder why Lapis Lazuli,&nbsp;whose default was always void of emotions, was surprised.</p><p>“Why are you looking at me like that?”</p><p>“…… I’m sorry. This one did not expect that your highness would possibly be able to do simple mathematics. It was so unexpected that this one had become&nbsp;speechless.”</p><p>It was an outrageous response that went beyond my imagination!</p><p>“Your highness’ deduction is correct. It would be difficult to repay the debt with just mining.”</p><p>“Yes. If it was you then I did not doubt that you would agre…… wait. If you knew that it would be difficult to repay the debt with that then why did you make me go mining&nbsp;in the first place?”</p><p>“This one does not understand what your highness’ is talking about. How could someone as lowly as myself possibly make a Demon Lord do something.&nbsp;All this one has done was gift a pickaxe to your highness.</p><p>“Oi, this bitch……?”</p><p>I looked at Lapis Lazuli with slanted eyes.</p><p>“Lazuli. This is the first time I’ve met a woman like yourself.”</p><p>“I do not deserve such high praise.”</p><p>“I’m not joking.”</p><p>A life over 20 years.</p><p>The only woman to have messed with me excluding my mother, was my second half little sister. Putting being a half-breed and an outcast aside, it was amazing that Lapis Lazuli had still not fallen.</p><p>For example.</p><p>I was purposely treating Lapis Lazuli with affection. My goal was affection points. A Demon Lord like myself was treating a low status person&nbsp;like her equally. I had judged that this by itself would be enough to raise her affection considerably.</p><p>However, the results was a failure.</p><p>If I talked to her slyly, then she’d match me and responded&nbsp;slyly. If I tossed a joke at her, then she’d, with her emotionless face, would respond with a joke.</p><p>That was it.</p><p>She gave off the feeling that&nbsp;‘since a Demon Lord like myself wanted this kind of chatter, then it was only appropriate to humor me’. As a result, she didn’t open herself up to me.</p><p>Like the need to greet in social interactions.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli treated me with only a dry and businesslike attitude.</p><p>…… and so, time passed helplessly.</p>"

Except one thing, I still had access to the  function to see the stats and affection of other people.</p><p>I could know if the other person truly had an interest towards me……  This was a precious skill. Especially for a person like me whose  everything relied on acting and politics.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli’s affection was only 2.</p><p>If I did not have this ability, then I would have most likely assumed  that ‘I’ve gotten on friendly terms with Lapis Lazuli now’. I wouldn’t  have been able to figure out what emotions lurked underneath that stoic  face of hers.</p><p>But I was certain now.</p><p>This person had a frozen heart.</p><p>I was nothing more than an object of business to this succubus girl.  The fact that the affection had barely gone up during this entire week  proved that. She was a formidable girl.</p><p>To get close to her and then use her…… that original plan of mine was disposed of. It failed magnificently.</p><p>Regardless, it didn’t mean that all my methods had vanished.</p><p>There was a method of handling people who moved with their heads instead of their hearts. I knew exactly what that was.</p><p>Except, it was one of the more drastic out of other drastic measures.</p><p>If you wanted to hunt a tiger then you had to take up the gun  yourself and dive into the mountain. At worst, I had to be prepared to  be torn apart by savage beasts. That mental attitude wasn’t something  you could simply order at a fast food restaurant and get moments later.</p><p>My own resolution.</p><p>If I don’t kill them then I’ll be the one to be killed, this kind of thinking was vital.</p><p>“Your highness.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli informed me calmly.</p><p>“If your highness does not repay the debt and interest or declare  bankruptcy, then the Keuncuska firm will have no other choice but to  take your highness’ property and body by force.”</p><p>“I am a Demon Lord. A person with one of the highest nobility amongst  demons. Who could possibly forcefully capture this Demon Lord?</p><p>“The Keuncuska Firm has a countless number of supporters. Amongst  them, there are other Demon Lords like your highness. Rank 5th Demon  Lord Marbas and Rank 9th Demon Lord Paimon are also included.”</p><p>The highest of Demon Lords.</p><p>They were people that a rank 71st like me couldn’t possibly face.</p><p>“Our firm is famous for being merciless to debtors who fail to make  their payments. In the past, there was an incident where Rank 25th Demon  Lord Glasyalabolas received a loan of 20,000 Libra and did not pay back  the interest for 2 years. At that time, our firm had hired a small  number of 9,000 mercenaries and left them in the command of Rank 12th  Demon Lord Sitri. Your highness. Demon Lord Glasyalabolas could not even  hold out for 3 weeks before surrendering.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli let out a sigh.</p><p>“…… That is the Keuncuska Firm’s strength. It is rational violence.  That is also the reason why our firm has been able to stay as the  highest amongst demons for the past 500 years. Your highness Dantalian,  this one is sincerely suggesting this. Please, declare bankruptcy a day  sooner.”</p><p>I pushed down the sheets of my bed.</p><p>“……”</p><p>It was fine.</p><p>I could still win.</p><p>If things goes as planned, then I could rip this girl in front of me apart and make her mine.</p><p>I firmed my resolve and—</p><p>slowly, opened my mouth.</p><p>“Lazuli. I will give you a proposal that will most definitely benefit you.”</p><p>“Yes, your highness. Please tell this one anything.”</p><p>“Seeing as it has already come to this, I shall borrow <strong>more</strong> money from that firm of yours.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli narrowed her brows.</p><p>Even if she were to hear that the world was going to be destroyed,  she would probably respond to that by saying, ‘Let it be destroyed in a  single moment’. For that Lapis Lazuli to narrow her brows was a huge  gesture.</p><p>“This one objects.”</p><p>Her voice became a level drier.</p><p>“Your highness Dantalian already has a debt. But it is still okay. If  your highness works hard for a while then your highness could more than  likely pay it all off. However, if your highness receives more of a  loan here……”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Then I’ll fall further into a swamp pit.”</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>“That’s what I want.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“Lapis Lazuli. Let us not be prudish and speak honestly.”</p><p>I held a soft smile on my lips.</p><p>“Even if you claim to be my exclusive consultant, you are still a  pawn for the Keuncuska Firm. Profit for your firm will, in the end,  become profit for you as well.”</p><p>According to her, Demon Lords had more than enough political uses.</p><p>To succeed in turning that figure into a puppet for the firm, Lapis  Lazuli will most likely receive high praise from the executives. She  will advance up faster than anyone else. To take a step, no, 20 steps,  ahead of other competition.</p><p>“……”</p><p>The mixed blood succubus still had a poker face.</p><p>Was she perhaps pretending to not know what I was talking about.</p><p>“Wouldn’t myself not being able to pay the debt off be a profit to you?”</p><p>“That is a misunderstanding. This one has always, for your highness……”</p><p>“I know full well of the habits of a merchant.”</p><p>If the other person tried to make an excuse then shift the topic.</p><p>We were not fighting with weapons, but with our words. I had to  attack fiercely. There was no need to listen to the other person’s  useless excuses.</p><p>“Since olden times, merchants did not invest into things that  wouldn’t give them profit. However, for some reason, the Keuncuska Firm  had loaned me 100 Libra…”</p><p>The fact that Dantalian was incompetent was already obvious to the world.</p><p>Even if they loaned him money, there was a zero to none chance of  getting anything back. It didn’t make sense. It was like a bank giving  millions of won to a credit defaulter.</p><p>This meant that they didn’t plan to collect the money <strong>in the first place</strong>.</p><p>“To put a dog collar on me.”</p><p>I grinned.</p><p>“To turn me into a puppet with the debt as a pretext. From the beginning, this was your firm’s goal. Am I wrong?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“You said it before. That if it was too difficult then that I had  ‘the option’ to declare bankruptcy. But in your mind, you honestly  wanted to say this.”</p><p>That bankruptcy was my <strong>only</strong> option.</p><p>A choice never existed from the get go.</p><p>The loan itself was a trap, and two months ago, the Demon Lord Dantalian got caught in it stupidly.</p><p>Now, deadpan succubus. Go on and respond.</p><p>You’re like a mountain fortress. Since it was built on top of a  rugged mountain, it was a wall that was difficult to conquer. It was  something annoying for invaders to even approach.</p><p>Regardless, if the fortress was sieged then it was over. I will not  give you a path to escape. I’ll capture your fortress in an instant……</p><h4>▯Keuncuska Merchant, Mixed Blood, Lapis Lazuli<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 4, Day 18</p><p> Keuncuska Firm Office</p></h4><p>Demon Lord Dantalian was smiling before my eyes.</p><p>…… Honestly confessing, I underestimated him.</p><p>It had been 1 year since I had become Demon Lord Dantalian’s exclusive consultant.</p><p>I had thought he was a good for nothing piece of trash, but it seems I  was mistaken. Truthfully, I was surprised. The intimidating sharp look  in his eyes and his gaze looking this way as if he was testing me.</p><p>His pupils were as dark as a well.</p><p>I couldn’t see the bottom…… that was the natural feeling I got. Was Dantalian always this kind of character?</p><p> Someone who got lucky and was born as a Demon Lord and thus lived a lazy  and sleazy life. At most, that was all I thought he was……</p><p>‘Ah’</p><p>For the first time, I realized my mistake.</p><p>Because of the unexpected blow I had taken, I had unintentionally stopped talking.</p><p>To make such a mistake. To be silent here meant that I was admitting that he was correct. I had to change the topic.</p><p>“Let us assume that what your highness has inferred is correct.”</p><p>“I do not want to know about hypotheses. What I want to know is the simple truth.”</p><p>…… Are you not even giving me a corner to escape to.</p><p>The back of my neck felt cold.</p><p>Demon Lord Dantalian had most certainly changed.</p><p>Half a month ago, Dantalian was being threatened by a group of  adventurers. Conveniently, it was a group of adventurers with a map of  the Demon Lord castle. They may have been a group of adventurers on the  same level as a small vigilante group in some far off mountain valley,  but Demon Lord Dantalian was in a serious situation…… was that it? Does  experiencing near death really change people so drastically?</p><p>Dantalian was a Demon Lord that I was in charge of. If that person  was to become competent then unmistakably it was a situation that I  should be welcoming with open arms. But honestly, it was hard to be  happy.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I wanted a Demon Lord on the level of a fox. I did not want a Demon  Lord on the level of a tiger. It would be troubling if the puppet was to  become too clever. Who could have expected for this to happen.</p><p>The Demon Lord gazed at me hard.</p><p>“Lala. Go to the Keuncuska Firm and tell them.”</p><p>Lala?</p><p>I blinked.</p><p>“Lapis Lazuli shortened to Lala. It’s a suitable nickname.”</p><p>“……Is your highness giving a lowly one such as myself a nickname?”</p><p>“Do you not like it?”</p><p>“This one is only grateful.”</p><p>The demon world was strictly a hierarchical society.</p><p>Even if the race was the same, if the tribes were different then your  status was different as well. If there were some orcs that were  considered to be nobles, then there were also  orcs that were treated as  slaves. If one were to try and figure out each and every of the ranks  that existed then they’d have to go through hundreds, if not thousands  of tribes and races.</p><p>I was an outcast. A half-breed of a succubus and a human. Succubus  already received scorn as being a race of prostitutes. But amongst  those, the person to be born between one and a vulgar human, was none  other than myself…… Thus I was a crossbreed.</p><p>A leprosy of society.</p><p>I could not dare to come in contact with other people with this  filthy body. By chance, if I were to even touch a person of a higher  status than myself then I would have to cut off a finger, if I were to  enter a temple then my toes would be severed, and if I were to even  recite a scripture from one of the Gods then my tongue would be sliced.</p><p>That was why, when Demon Lord Dantalian had stepped on my foot I  became nervous. Thankfully, it was shrugged off as a joke, but if  someone else had seen this then my foot would have had to been cut off.  Now looking back at it, that was most likely Dantalian’s way of  threatening me.</p><p>As expected, I had to go along with the Demon Lord’s rhythm here.</p><p>I shall lower my head at once.</p><p>“What is the message that this one should deliver to the firm?”</p><p>“Demon Lord Dantalian has finally gone mad. Because he did not have  anyone else to rely on he had entrusted his mind and body to you, a  succubus. You, making full use of your charm, was able to successfully  entice the Demon Lord.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>What were his intentions.</p><p>I couldn’t grasp what was going on in his head. However, even if I  honestly spoke my mind about how foolish of an idea that was, I’d  probably be pushed back in the battle of vigor. For now, I will respond  as if I understood completely and as if that sounded like an interesting  idea. There were times where an empty boast was a valid tactic.</p><p>“So. A mere peasant such as this one will become your highness’ concubine……? That is an interesting story.”</p><p>“Since long ago, there was nothing more romantic than the story of a  prince falling in love with a peasant. It is a story that goes over big  regardless of what time period it is told in. Tell your firm executives  that I am so head over heels for you that it seems like I won’t be able  to get out.”</p><p>“That is quite the part being given to this one. That is more than this one deserves.”</p><p>“Aah. Dantalian, doing whatever he can for money, started to spout  nonsense. He claims that a disease will spread within two months, and  that he knows what the cure for that disease is. That he’ll monopolize  the ingredients to the cure before the plague spreads and he’ll be able  to gain a fortune. Tell the firm that I wish to gain another loan with  that statement.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>I see.</p><p>I was able to understand just barely.</p><p>Right now, Dantalian was setting himself up to be a clown. A Demon  Lord who fell for a mere succubus. Adding to that, in order to gain  another loan he made up a ridiculous lie……</p><p>“The loan amount then, huh. About 10,000 gold coins should suffice.”</p><p>“To say 10,000 gold coins……”</p><p>It was an amount that couldn’t be paid off even if he worked for 130 years.</p><p>If you included the interest, then it was an even more distant sum.</p><p>The firm executives would probably welcome it with open arms.</p><p>That was obvious. The larger the debt, then the stronger the collar  on Dantalian’s neck would become. It was like a Demon Lord making a mad  dash straight into a trap to self-destruct.</p><p>I’d be the very person to have lured the Demon Lord to his own  destruction in this comedy, thus gaining an incredible amount of merits.  No matter how low my status was, people could not ignore my  contribution. At once, I’d become a candidate to become an executive  for the firm.</p><p>“How about it? Does this much attract your interest?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>A sweet offer.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>No matter how you looked at it, it was an opportunity to gain an enormous amount of profit.</p><p>…… It was so tempting that I felt more suspicion from it.</p><p>Where would Dantalian get any benefit from this? This was a story  only good for me. I didn’t expect him to give me a proper response, but I  should ask him for now.</p><p>“Your highness. This one does not understand. Where does your highness plan to gain profit from this grand play?”</p><p>“You are a merchant.”</p><p>His highness Dantalian responded calmly.</p><p>“Merchants thoroughly check if there’s profit to be gained and if  there is, then they’ll dash for it. If you see profit in my offer, then  shouldn’t you be taking it with no questions asked?”</p><p>“Your highness is correct. However, to be cautious in front of  game that appears excessively appetizing, is also a proper merchant’s  attitude. If this one had woken up one morning and was told that a fox  was sprawled out at the front door, then that would be hard to believe.”</p><p>Upon saying that, his highness grinned.</p><p>“Why not? The fox could have fallen for you at first sight.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>He was smooth.</p><p>His talking ability wasn’t on an average level.</p><p>Even if he had been at death’s doors before, was it possible for a  person to change this much? It was strange. From a common sense point of  view, this was incomprehensible.</p><p>“Lala. When a hunter is catching a fox, there are no cases where the  hunter shows consideration for the fox’s feelings. That would be  laughable. As a hunter, what you have to do is simple. First, take out a  crossbow—”</p><p>His highness Dantalian moved his hands.</p><p>As if there really was a crossbow there.</p><p>“Go after the fox with the resolve to kill. If you fumble the shot  then you will only startle it and cause it to flee. Aim exactly at the  center of their forehead. And then……”</p><p>The invisible bolt on the crossbow was aimed at my forehead.</p><p>His highness Dantalian pulled the trigger.</p><p>“Bang.”</p><p>Playfully, he fired.</p><p>“Splendidly finish it off in one hit.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Go to the firm right away and tell them. That Dantalian has finally  gone insane. That it’s the golden opportunity to forever bind that  pathetic Demon Lord.”</p><p>His highness Dantalian lightly patted my shoulder.</p><p>A corner of my mind felt uneasy. On one hand, my rationality was  saying that his highness was correct, but on the other hand, my heart  was throwing up red flags.</p><p><strong>This was a trap.</strong></p><p>A cruel snare was placed before me.</p><p>If I put my foot forward thoughtlessly then it could be my end.</p><p>……Whenever my mind and heart reacted separately I would always follow  the former. The problem was this situation, my heart was pounding at an  unprecedented speed.</p><p>Pushing down the ominous foreboding feeling.</p><p>I moved my lips.</p><p>“Your highness. This one only fears this one situation. Namely, the  game that this one had thought to be a fox had turned out to be a tiger.  One arrow is not enough to catch a tiger.”</p><p>“Well. Then I guess you can only get eaten by the tiger at that point.”</p><p>His highness Dantalian put out his right hand.</p><p>Not understanding what that hand gesture meant, I stared blankly.</p><p>His highness, thinking it was helpless, smiled wryly.</p><p>“How long do you plan to leave my hand by itself like this?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>At last, I realized that his highness was requesting for a handshake.</p><p>To ask for a handshake. I did not know how to respond.</p><p>I had never held someone’s hand before up until now. The fact that  our feet had touched was still excusable, but if our hands were to touch  then that would be a clear crime.</p><p>“……A person of obscure birth such as this one could not dare dirty the hands of your highness.”</p><p>His highness Dantalian most likely knew this as well.</p><p>He was a person who had held a peerless amount of pride when it  involved aristocratism, after all. He didn’t even consider something  like myself as a person. I didn’t hold a personal grudge because of  that. It would be stranger for a Demon Lord to not treat a  succubus/human mixed blood like so.</p><p>I did not have a desire to sever my wrists.</p><p>“Pardon this one’s opinion, but while this one is grateful, this one  would only trouble your highness’ dignity. Please withdraw your  highness’ hand.”</p><p>“What a strange place to be worried about losing face while discussing such a daring topic.”</p><p>His highness Dantalian chuckled.</p><p>“If you shake my hand then would my hand suddenly become defiled,  make me catch a cold, and cause my social status to drop? I merely wish  to shake hands with the meaning of treating each other well from this  point on.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Even if your highness were to now have a negative opinion of the  hierarchical system, the majority of the people do not share that  opinion. If a peasant such as this one were to come in contact with your  highness’ body then upon this one a legal punishment will……”</p><p>“Ooh. So are those ‘majority’ here?”</p><p>With exaggerated movements, his highness Dantalian takes a look  around. Naturally, there were only his highness and myself, the two of  us here.</p><p>“Demon Lord Dantalian is also a trash like person anyways. I am only a  Demon Lord by name. I do not have anything at all. Lala. Do you still  wish not to shake my hand?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Having said that much, I did not have the right to refuse.</p><p>Carefully, I reached out and touched his hand.</p><p>The first person’s hand that I had ever touched was cold. I furtively  felt the touch of his palm. Upon doing so, his highness Dantalian  grasped my hand tightly.</p><p>“Treat me well from now on.”</p><p>“…… Yes. Please treat this one well as well, your highness.”</p><p>It felt like it would be a long relationship.</p><p>I wasn’t sure why, but my intuition told me so.</p><p><img src=\"http://novelfull.com/uploads/novel/chapter3page2.jpg\"></p><h4>▯Keuncuska Executive, Miser Goblin, Torukel<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 4, Day 20</p><p> Keuncuska Firm Headquarters, Conference Room</p></h4><p>“For there to be a full assembly. Quite the rare occasion, keruk.” <em>(TL note: That’s the sound he’s making ‘keruk’. It has no meaning.)</em></p><p>An order had suddenly come from the firm headquarters for a full assembly.</p><p>Keuncuska executives were dispatched across the continent. I too had  plans to go to Bataafse today to direct a fleet. This full assembly was  clearly not scheduled.</p><p>To suddenly call for all the executives to gather…… it wasn’t an  everyday occurrence. I had a bad feeling. Did something big happen  somewhere, perhaps.</p><p>Concealing my anxious mind, I made my way to the headquarters. In a large meeting room all of the executives were gathered.</p><p>“Keruruk.”</p><p>Still as usual, there were a bunch of rough mugs. Vampires,  werewolves, lizardmen. It was quite the exhibition of races. ……Hm? In  one corner of the conference room there was a girl that I had never seen  before. Her hair was a light pink. Races with that hair color were  rare.</p><p>It was then that I had made eye contact with that girl.</p><p>“Hm……!”</p><p>Unintentionally, I gulped.</p><p>The venomous eyes on her emotionless face were out of the ordinary.  Those were eyes of a person who had killed before. And not only one or  two people, but eyes that had killed a countless number of times.  Thankfully, the time we exchanged glances was short. The girl had  shortly after turned her head.</p><p>Keruk.</p><p>I didn’t know who she was, but this emergency assembly was probably  called for because of her. Situations always precipitate because of  unwelcomed guests. There was a girl I had never seen before here. I  could easily analogize.</p><p>The executives were voicing their discontent.</p><p>“Now that Miser Torukel is also here, start the conference already.”</p><p>“Do you know how many pushed customers there are?”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s right. It’ll be bad if I can’t sell all of the dried herrings today.”</p><p>What impatient people.</p><p>Even I had plans to hold an audience with the merchants of Phrygia at  the harbor. I had a fairly busy body. Time is essential for a merchant.  Be it a meeting or whatever, start already. And if possible, end it  soon.</p><p>“Well. Everyone calm down.”</p><p>The old vampire sitting in the upper seat calmed the executives.</p><p>“There is a reason why we have called for all of the executives to gather. We will not waste your time so do not worry.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok.</p><p>That old man with the splendidly grown white beard was our firm’s  highest executive. He could be referred to as the actual person who was  controlling the entire firm.</p><p>Fitting for a person known as vampire, he had lived for over 600  years. Although, I do have to say that he should crawl into his coffin  and have his funeral carried out already. He sure does live for a long  time.</p><p>“Now then, Lapis Lazuli. Explain.”</p><p>“Yes, chief.”</p><p>The girl responded at the center of the conference room.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli? ……  I had heard of that name before.</p><p>“It’s the fellow born with the cursed bloodline.”</p><p>“Why is something like that attending this executive conference?”</p><p>Several of the executives had recognized the identity of the girl.  While creasing their brows they started to whisper among one another.  They were openly displaying their discomfort.</p><p>Aah. I remembered. It was the kid who, despite being an outcast, was able to successfully settle into our firm.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>There was a time that a topic of a girl who had talent that surpassed  her status was going around. Keruruk, so that girl was the main  charater of that dispute.</p><p>Certainly, her voice was clear. She was calm even though she was  standing before this galaxy-like group of executives. It wasn’t normal  courage, that was for certain.</p><p>“Chief, that isn’t even an executive candidate. Is that not just an office clerk? What is this? There are limits to exceptions.”</p><p>“It is already unpleasant that I have to breathe the same air as a crossbreed.”</p><p>The executives poured out their complaints.</p><p>How idiotic.</p><p>The hierarchical system was nothing more than a useless antique. It  was a tool that stupid nobles used to raise their even dumber sons and  daughters. Despite that, do you scorn this outcast. In the first place,  us merchants already had low ranks. Tsk tsk, they were cutting off their  nose to spite their face. <em>(TL note: An expression used to describe a needlessly self-destructive over-reaction to a problem)</em></p><p>Ivar Lodbrok smiled bitterly.</p><p>“How about listening to what she has to say first. It is something  profitable. Gold that’s been in a pig’s stomach and gold that has been  dipped in holy water, they all have the same value…… Lapis Lazuli.”</p><p>“Yes. Demon Lord Dantalian has requested for a loan.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli spoke calmly.</p><p>“Currently, Demon Lord Dantalian has a debt of 196 Libra. Even if he  has to raise his debt further, he is planning to obtain a come from  behind victory.”</p><p>“Hm.”</p><p>The executives turned to look at each other.</p><p>Regardless to their previous attitude, these people still had a good  head on their shoulders. They quickly realized that this was a heavy  agenda. Putting behind Lapis Lazuli’s status for now, the executives  started to mutter amongst one another.</p><p>“Is he planning to use debt to stop debt.”</p><p>“That’s the height of stupidity right there.”</p><p>“The bunny is offering to get itself caught in the trap, there’s no reason to decline.”</p><p>“So? How much does he want to borrow?”</p><p>My thoughts were the same.</p><p>Demon Lords had a political use, even if he was a rank 71st Demon Lord. It’d be good to use this chance to tie him up.</p><p>However, after the following response, all of the executives went silent.</p><p>“The amount that Demon Lord Dantalian has requested is— 10,000 gold coins.”</p><p>What?</p><p>The expression of the executives was dumbstruck.</p><p>“Is he sane!”</p><p>“Ha, for a bumpkin who couldn’t even handle 100 gold coins.”</p><p>He was crazy, that’s insane. Those kind of words flew out openly.  Despite the fact that we were badmouthing a Demon Lord, who were at the  peak of social status, it was fine. There was no one other than us to  hear it.</p><p>“Are you certain. 10,000 gold coins. Was that what he said exactly?”</p><p>“Swearing on the River of Styx, I am certain.”</p><p>“He really has gone mad……”</p><p>The executives smirked.</p><p>10,000 gold coins was about the amount an Earl would earn annually if  the population in his territory reached 50,000. Last year, the budget  processed by the Imperials from the Habsburg Empire was about 500,000  Libra.</p><p>For Demon Lord Dantalian, who didn’t have either territory or  citizens, to request for 1/50 the amount earned by a great empire in a  year? Did he have a slime in his skull instead of a brain?</p><p>“My dear Keuncuska comrades.”</p><p>He had probably judged that the atmosphere was getting complex. Ivar Lodbrok opened his mouth.</p><p>The meeting room slowly became quiet. If that old vampire spoke, then even the most proudest of executives closed their mouths.</p><p>“I personally think that this is a good opportunity. Certainly 10,000  gold coins is a fortune. However, if it means to make a Demon Lord  forever be our housekeeping pet, then it is not that much of a precious  amount.”</p><p>“Keruruk.”</p><p>I carelessly let out a laugh.</p><p>Sacred and inviolable representatives that symbolizes absolute  dignity, one of the 72 lords that commands an army of demons. To have  referred to such nobility as a housekeeping pet…… Indeed he was one of  the three ancient vampires to still remain in this world. It was a  haughty attitude fitting of Ivar Lodbrok.</p><p>Well, I’d feel sorry for leaving this entire meeting to only Ivar Lodbrok. Let’s step forward a bit here.</p><p>“Wait, chief. I have something that I wish to ask on my side.”</p><p>“Mm. Do not mince your words and speak your thoughts.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok met my eyes.</p><p>Pure red pupils. It was a color that reminded people of blood. There  were some executives that’d whisper to one other that those eyes were  frightening, however, for some reason, I could only think of those eyes  as beautiful. Cold-hearted, harsh, and a cynical vampire…… Ivar Lodbrok  will most definitely establish this firm into an imperishable company.  If possible, I want to be there when that happens. That was my small  dream.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Could it not be a trap?”</p><p>“A trap?”</p><p>“Not one or two gold coins, but no less than 10,000 gold coins.  Keruk. If Demon Lord Dantalian truly wasn’t insane, then he would have a  plan.”</p><p>I did not think that Demon Lord Dantalian could possibly possess the  ability to handle this huge loan. Regardless, one must consider every  possibility in the world. This had to be made clear.</p><p>“That is a fairly good point.”</p><p>Hm?</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok was smiling faintly. It was an expression he’d show when  he was thinking of a wicked plan. Even if he was as old as old can be,  that man had cool wrinkles.</p><p>“Lapis Lazuli shall explain that part.”</p><p>“Yes, chief. I’d like to inform the pillars of Keuncuska. Currently, Demon Lord Dantalian is regarding myself as his concubine.”</p><p>“……What did you say?”</p><p>“This may be rude to say, but on my own decision, I had used my charms to entice the Demon Lord Dantalian.”</p><p>This time, the executives could not hold back their astonishment.</p><p>On the other hand, Lapis Lazuli—from start to finish maintained her emotionless face. Always calm.</p><p>No, I didn’t know whether to call that calm. Any sign of tension on  her face was completely missing. For a normal office worker to not even  twitch a brow when in front of all these executives? Calm or not, that  was clearly strange……</p><p>“Lapis Lazuli. What do you mean by charm?”</p><p>I spoke with a sour tone.</p><p>“Are you saying that you captured the Demon Lord by using your body?”</p><p>“Just as you say, sir Torukel.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli looked straight this way.</p><p>Solid pupils as blue as azure.</p><p>Her transparent gaze did not even budge.</p><p>“I had relations with Demon Lord Dantalian.”</p><p>“My god.”</p><p>A few executives murmured to themselves.</p><p>If one were to fornicate with a mixed blood crossbreed, a curse from  God will fall upon you. It may have just been a superstition but when  90% of the population on this continent believed it seriously, you could  not brush it off. For a sacred and inviolable Demon Lord to be defiled  by a crossbreed. That itself was the obstinate problem. This would cause  a tremendous issue to occur.</p><p>“Do you understand what you have done!”</p><p>“We could be excommunicated by the temple!”</p><p>The executives were thrusting their fingers at Lapis Lazuli’s face.</p><p>If you wanted to sell and buy products in this continent, then you  had to have received a permit from the temple. Also, excluding the  temple of Aphrodite and Artemis, all other temples strictly forbid  outcasts from having intercourse with people of different social  status……</p><p>The executives, with red faces, shouted.</p><p>“Chief! Kick that whore out right this instant!”</p><p>“Not only did she go against the laws from the Gods, but she has also  put our firm in danger! We shouldn’t have let that accursed being into  our firm in the first place!”</p><p>“This leprosy-like scum……!”</p><p>Criticism took the conference room by storm.</p><p>The prostitutes of the demon world, succubus.</p><p>And amongst those, the especially disgusting crossbreed.</p><p>Even I, who disliked the hierarchical system, was speechless.  However, Ivar Lodbrok was calmly sitting in his seat and watching the  succubus.</p><p>“That is not all. There is still one part that must be explained to the executives. What are you doing? Hurry up and tell them.”</p><p>There was a mischievous laugh mixed in Ivar Lodbrok’s voice…… he was  enjoying this? Even though, adding a bit of exaggeration, the life and  death of our company was on the line? In any case, vampires were not  sane. Their heads were weird since they didn’t receive any sunlight.  Lack of nutrition gives a serious blow to your mind. As a goblin with  both refinement and common knowledge, I couldn’t keep up with him.</p><p>“Yes. There is something that I have still not told all of the executives.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli continued to speak in a low tone.</p><p>She had received all kinds of curses and swears a second ago. Are you  telling me she was still unfazed? She really was not normal.</p><p>“As you all may know, originally our firm did not deal with Demon  Lords below the rank of 60 as customers. Since it meant that the class  of our firm would go down. Regardless, I have been working as Demon Lord  Dantalian’s exclusive consultant for the past year now. There was only  one reason for this.”</p><p>After taking one breath, Lapis Lazuli announced.</p><p>“I, personally, had strongly requested for that consultant position.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“From the beginning I had been aiming for the position of Demon Lord Dantalian’s mistress.”</p><p>The executives started to get noisy.</p><p>The people who were criticising the succubus a second ago were now  baffled. It was because Lapis Lazuli had spoken in such a dignified  fashion. The situation was going further away from the area in which the  executives could understand.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>At that moment, someone laughed.</p><p>Turning my head, Ivar Lodbrok was laughing loudly. To be laughing in  this kind of situation. Ignoring the fact that the executives were all  dumbfounded, Ivar Lodbrok let out a roar.</p><p>“Comrades. Do you still not understand? Demon Lord Dantalian did not  suddenly go insane. Everything was done by that succubus. In no more  than a year, that kid was able to turn Demon Lord Dantalian into a slave  of passion.”</p><p>So was that it. That’s what it was!</p><p>At last, everything made sense.</p><p>Although Lapis Lazuli’s status was low, she had quite the remarkable  appearance. She had captivated the Demon Lord with her looks. And,  unknown to us on how, she was able to incite the Demon Lord into  borrowing a large fortune from the firm……</p><p>The other executives must have also realized the true nature of the  situation. Their faces were becoming pale. They weren’t giving Lapis  Lazuli looks of contempt anymore.</p><p>“But…… why such a reckless act……?”</p><p>“To succeed.”</p><p>“Succeed?”</p><p>“The Demon Lord will become the firm’s informant. My contribution on this matter will most likely receive high praise.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Everyone. All of the members in the meeting room were at a lost for words.</p><p>What were they supposed to say to the office worker who had just  confessed with an emotionless face that ‘I had sold my body in order to  succeed’.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok, alone, has been laughing since before.</p><p>“How is it, comrades. Is this not a masterpiece!”</p><p>“…… a masterpiece?”</p><p>I ended up asking back.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok stood from his seat. He had spread his arms out wide as  if he were showcasing something. It was like he was introducing the next  actor to step on stage.</p><p>“That is so. A masterpiece. That half-breed is the trash of society.  Born as a rat crawling on the floor. From the start she was destined to  silently age and die in some back alley…… and yet, look! That succubus  was not only able to get into the highest firm in the demon world, she  was able to become the mistress of a Demon Lord!”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“If this is not a masterpiece then what would it be. Is this pure  desire to succeed not beautiful. Is this pure desire for power not  blinding. Ooh, whenever I see a militant young lad like this I can’t  help but shed a tear and praise out. <strong>Power is a lady! Thus, they will always only love warriors!”</strong></p><p><img src=\"http://novelfull.com/uploads/novel/volume-1-page-2.jpg\"></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>The executives were overwhelmed by Ivar Lodbrok’s madness.</p><p>But I was a bit different.</p><p>My heart was pounding.</p><p>That was the madness that I had fallen for.</p><p>Like a mosquito born in a dark and moist swamp would yearn for the  glorious sun. I, who was always normal and followed common-sense,  couldn’t help but be attracted to Ivar Lodbrok who was located in the  complete opposite of my position.</p><p>“Lapis Lazuli. Go and tell the Demon Lord! That we will gladly lend something like 10,000 gold whenever he desires!”</p><p>“I shall carry out your order at once, chief.”</p><p>“And that great desire to succeed where you had even offered your  virginity just for our firm. Truthfully, I took a liking to it.  Keuncuska is a place only concerned about one’s skills and  contributions. You have more than enough rights to receive a reward.  Tell me what you desire.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok spoke coldly.</p><p>“Is it gold? Is it honor? I could even offer to adopt you as  my daughter. Your biggest weakness is probably your status, right? If  you become my child then that weakness will disappear considerably.”</p><p>“Chief! No matter how much she has done that’s—”</p><p>“Do not impede on another person’s conversation, comrade.”</p><p>When the executives tried to oppose, Ivar Lodbrok silenced them.</p><p>“I’m trying to enjoy a conversation with this outcast who was able to entice a Demon Lord.”</p><p>Eyes as red as blood slowly gazed over the executives.</p><p>A thick killing intent. The executives shrunk back their shoulders. The air in the meeting room instantly became cold.</p><p>“So, Lapis Lazuli. Tell me what you desire.”</p><p>“Please prepare a seat for me in the executive meetings.”</p><p>The other executives were badly shaken.</p><p>A normal white-collar office worker had just requested to become an  executive. It was impressive. However, there was something more  impressive. What shocked the executives more was Ivar Lodbrok’s  response.</p><p>“Not gold or honor, but authority. Okay then.”</p><p>“C-Chief……!”</p><p>“If the plan goes well, then I shall promote you to the executive in  charge of the entire region of Dolstat. With the Rhine River as the  center, Cologne, Xanten, Wirthen, Strasbourg, Duisburg, Worms, and Mainz  will be in your jurisdiction. How is that?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ivar Lodbrok was examining the girl. He was most likely testing her boldness with his eyes.</p><p>“It would be an honor.”</p><p>“The strength of the Empire has weakened, so in accordance to that,  the autonomy in these cities are at the highest point ever in history.  As much as the development has suddenly changed, empty-headed people  will be tossed to the side and only the true talented people will  survive. Lapis Lazuli. I wonder if you will be able to withstand these  conditions.”</p><p>“I will prove it with my ability.”</p><p>“Of course you will. Since if you took out ability, then you’d have nothing.”</p><p>For the second time, Ivar Lodbrok laughed loudly.</p><p>In the dark conference room, all the executives were dumbfounded. It  was as if this old vampire and this cold succubus were in a world of  their own.</p><p>I must admit, this had become an absurd situation.</p><p>To make a succubus who lacked a lot of experience, and was also a  half-breed, into a branch manager. There was a limit to advancing  quickly. This will be the first time in Keuncuska history, as well as it  will be its last for this to happen.</p><p>“Keruruk.”</p><p>But, Demon Lord Dantalion, huh. I did get the feeling that we were  looking down on him too much…… but oh well. He was only rank 71st  anyways. It would be good enough to just put a decent amount of caution.</p><p>This was interesting. I ended up getting a bit excited too.</p><p>Let us enjoy playing around with his highness Demon Lord.</p><hr><p>TL note: Oh boy two illustrations in one part! That means there won’t be another one for a long time!</p><p>Okay, sorry for the, I guess you could say, late update. I have a  policy of not working on the translations during the weekend because I  want to be able to rest fully. But honestly, after the positive response  I got from puttin’ this story up on novelupdate. I might change my own  policy.</p><p> I actually ended up getting really excited to translate this story  because of that, so there might be some weird parts here and there  because of the excitment. I did my best to reread this chapter like 5  times before I published it, but mistakes will exist!</p><p>It’s honestly a lot tougher than I expected to convert old Korean  speech into English. Mainly because I’m not really sure how to write  proper olden time English. So basically in my mind, “harder sentence  structure = how people spoke long ago”. Feel free to let me know if I  should change that.</p><p>There’s also an important question I’d like to ask you guys. There  are illustrations at the front of the light novel that I haven’t really  shown, so I was wondering if you guys would want phone camera quality  images of ’em. Albeit, the illustrations are pretty much for the last  chapter in the volume. (Sorry I can’t scan ’em since I don’t have access  to a scanner! These illustrations aren’t anywhere online either. Just  other people also taking photos on their phones)</p><p>I ended up writing an essay in the TL note… whoops! (シ_ _)シ</p>"

Despite the way I am, the fate of the universe is being spread out in my head.”</p><p>Two months had already passed.</p><p>Ever since I had borrowed the gold, I had spent the past 2 months plainly&nbsp;doing things at my leisure. It had already become a daily routine for Lapis Lazuli to come find me and start sighing.</p><p>“The piled interest is already no less than 2,000 Libra.”</p><p>“Ah, this book is quite enjoyable.”</p><p>I was flipping through a book while lying down. The title of the book was &lt;Chronicles of the Great Demon Lords and the Custom Laws That Were Derived From Them&gt;.</p><p>The reason why I was reading this kind of literature was simple.</p><p>The information I had of this world was heavily leaned towards one side.</p><p>&lt;Dungeon Attack&gt; was a game where you played in the shoes of the human hero. Thanks to that, I may have been knowledgeable about the humans and their society, but I was ridiculously ignorant regarding the demon world.</p><p>At most, there was a vampire heroine that falls for the protagonist and thus surrenders to him. But that was it. That heroine never went&nbsp;into details about the demon world.</p><p>Well. It just meant that I had to study it on my own.</p><p>“Hoh. In this world, for a Demon Lord to attack another Demon Lord, they must have at least sent a declaration of war two times, huh. What a pointless place to stick to formality. Although, it is an impressive mean to prevent war. Hm, hm.”</p><p>“If your highness continues to not take any measures like this, your highness will end up bankrupting within 3 months. Please be aware, your highness.”</p><p>“I want to eat some ice cream—”</p><p>“……”</p><p>She&nbsp;had&nbsp;probably realize that this side was completely ignoring her.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli pressed her forehead with her index finger and thumb. Although her face was still emotionless, I could judge by her mood&nbsp;that she was receiving a lot of stress.</p><p>I gave her a bold-faced smile.</p><p>“Do not worry. Since all the preparation is already complete.”</p><p>“…… My apologies, your highness. Excluding the order that your highness had given this one two months ago, has your highness done anything else?”</p><p>“That was all the preparation needed.”</p><p>About 50 days ago.</p><p>I had made Lapis Lazuli purchase a certain herb in mass. Right now, it was a plant that most people would only look at to be merely a useless piece of greenery. However, I knew the future.</p><p>The current date was year 1505 on the Empire calendar.</p><p>This summer, an infectious disease will occur and spread across the entire continent.</p><p>In the future this disease will be known as the Black Death and spread throughout&nbsp;the continent as the symbol of fear. Nearly 40% of the entire population on the continent will be wiped out, making it so that calling it a nightmare wouldn’t be even remotely close to describing the event. In Dungeon Attack, the game started around the time that the Black Death had already past…… to be exact, the game story started in the year 1515 on the Empire calendar.</p><p>A tragedy yet to have arrived. It was something I shouldn’t be concerned with, right? The interesting part was what came next.</p><p>This plague, surprisingly, had a cure.</p><p>The name was plainly&nbsp;‘Black Herb’. Since it cured the Black Death, it was&nbsp;thus&nbsp;called&nbsp;Black Herb. The people of this world had a dreadful naming sense. They’d probably give an illegitimate child a better name.</p><p>‘Angel’s Herb’, ‘Goddess’ Mercy’, ‘Apollon’s Liver’, these kind of glittering nicknames followed after. However, this was also talk of&nbsp;the future. The summer of 1505 on the Empire calendar, before the plague had arrived, this Black Herb was simply a weed. In many regions, this was a plant that didn’t even have the honor of having a name.</p><p>That was it.</p><p>A weed.</p><p>It was a piece of greenery with absolutely no monetary value—</p><p>I, using&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;10,000 gold coins, invested into this plant.</p><p>Truthfully, it was easy.</p><p>First, I made a contract with the smaller merchant firms around the continent. Next, through the smaller firms, I was able to form a contract with the pharmacists spread throughout the land. And finally, the pharmacists hired herb gatherers from cities and villages. Instantly, a three-way contract was signed. The broker and transportation fee for the small firms, 2,000 gold coins. The pharmacy fee and herb gatherers’ personnel expenses, 6,000 gold coins. In addition, in order to be able to keep the herbs as fresh as possible, I had obtained&nbsp;a semi-permanent storage of the highest quality.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I was still not used to this world’s customs, but it was fine. I planned big wherever I was. All the detailed(lazy) affairs were handled by Lapis Lazuli as a proxy.</p><p>The person to go around making contracts with the small firms and pharmacists was not myself, but Lapis Lazuli. Some could say we were a good match. We were quite the amazing combination.</p><p>People who didn’t know the inside story would probably burst out in laughter if they saw this.</p><p>He had borrowed 10,000 Libra and we were curious as to see what he would do with it, but would you look at that. He bought a bunch of plants that weren’t even used to eat, and was storing them as if they were some sort of treasure.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli had tipped me off on what the executives at the firm were saying, ‘That’s the biggest joke I’ve heard all year’, they said and laughed their heads off, is what she told me.</p><p>Demon Lord Dantalian’s antics were even&nbsp;the talk of the town.</p><p>‘The foolish act of the lowest and crazy Demon Lord.’</p><p>‘10,000 gold coins worth of bullshit.’</p><p>‘Throwing his life away just for some attention!’</p><p>etc etc</p><p>I was incredibly pleased.</p><p>To be able to put laughter into other people’s lives with such trifling matters. Was this not the true fruits of life? Besides, we all lived an endlessly hard and dry life. If I was able&nbsp;to put a smile on these people’s faces then I could not be more happy.</p><p>Was I serious?</p><p>That’s why I’ll be making it more interesting.</p><p>Not the best joke you’ve heard all year, but the best joke you will ever hear in your entire life. ‘The plant that we thought was just a weed was actually as rare as a jewel!’, that was the kind of ending that awaited. If you had common sense, then you could only laugh till your insides shook.</p><p>“I truly am curious as to what face you will show me in a month.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“Since you display&nbsp;no emotions all year round. It’ll be alright for you to look forward to it. I will most certainly make you laugh.”</p><p>“…… This one does not understand what your highness is talking about.”</p><p>“Wait patiently and you will know everything.”</p><p>While rolling around on my bed, I giggled.</p><p>Was it because I had teased her a bit too much. A notice popped up.</p><p><strong>[Merchant Lapis Lazuli’s affection went down by 1.]</strong></p><p>Oh dear. With this, Lapis Lazuli’s affection had&nbsp;become 0. It had been dropping since 2 months ago, and now it had finally reached the bottom. A stranger would probably treat me better than her now.</p><p>“Apologies, but this one shall make her leave here. There are a lot of paperwork from the firm that has been pushed back.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli coldly turned her back towards me.</p><p>“Ah, Lala.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“Take this with you.”</p><p>I tossed her a piece of parchment.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli received the note with both hands.</p><p>“…… your highness. This is?”</p><p>I gave her a playful wink.</p><p>“It is fine to not return to my castle for the time being. Instead, go to that location and look at the situations there. Since you will discover something interesting.”</p><p>After Lapis Lazuli gave me a gaze full of a suspicion, she soon departed.</p><p>That piece of paper was the last trap. Lapis Lazuli will most likely realize the existence of the trap much later. I look forward to that day.</p><h4>▯Keuncuska Merchant, Mixed Blood, Lapis Lazuli</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 6, Day 27</p><p>Syracuse Relaxation Hot Springs</p><p>“Haa……”</p><p>Sighs kept coming out. I wonder how many times that made it now.</p><p>The great Keuncuska executive candidate, Lapis Lazuli, was currently at a hot springs. It was a place where the citizens enjoyed to take baths. Men and women were proudly walking in front of me in the nude.</p><p>Although I’m saying this, I too was&nbsp;unclothed. Men would stroll through the halls and look this way with an obscene gaze. Their eyes were incredibly unpleasant…… I wanted to crush the eyes of each and every one of these men.</p><p>Hot springs were not only a place for relaxation, but it was a type of love area as well. In other words, you could say people were dating in the nude.</p><p>A man and a woman would go into a spring and naturally start to&nbsp;philander. It was a kind of culture. Even now, I could hear the sound of moaning over on the side…… I was desperately keeping my head turned away.</p><p>“Haa.”</p><p>Another sigh.</p><p>There was a reason, that was so simple that is was shocking, to why&nbsp;I was here in Syracuse, the southmost area in the continent. In the note that his highness Dantalian had passed onto me had contained strange words.</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Sardinia Kingdom, Syracuse, Citizen Bathhouse, Clinic</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Starting point</em></strong></p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p><strong><em>Joint pain, high temperature, skin turning black</em></strong></p></blockquote><p>At glance, if one had no context then it’d appear like some code.</p><p>His highness Dantalian had been mentioning a disease for the past two months now. At the time, I had misunderstood that it was just his highness purposely saying nonsense. However, after seeing him write this note and pass&nbsp;it on to me, it seemed he was actually&nbsp;serious about it…… This was a joke, right? Anyone was fine, so please tell me this was a joke.</p><p>Was that so. Was there no one.</p><p>“Haa.”</p><p>I had sighed for the third time already.</p><p>Diseases themselves were not rare. Regardless, to predict when and where a disease would appear? In addition to that, to also already know what the cure to that disease was? That was impossible. That was why it was natural that the executives were treating his highness as a madman.</p><p>Honestly, it may had have been a little amount, but I had hopes.</p><p>His highness, who was once helpless but&nbsp;had overcome a life or death situation, to be reborn as a true Demon Lord…… That kind of folktale-like story, it may have been a small amount, but I had hopes for it.</p><p>But rank 71st.</p><p>Was he just&nbsp;an idiot that was beyond remedy.</p><p>Demon Lord Dantalian really did absolutely nothing after having bought all those plants. He only rolled around on his newly bought bed like a child. It was honestly pathetic.</p><p>“Ooh. Lady, you’re quite the pretty one.”</p><p>A pedestrian who was also using the bath tried to talk to me.</p><p>I was currently using magic to disguise myself as a human. It may had been magic but it was nothing impressive. I had only changed my hair color to red. Succubus were&nbsp;a demonic race, but their outer appearance was pretty much identical to that of a human. I was able to simply conceal my identity.</p><p>“How ’bout it, in a single pool for 3 silver…… euut!?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>I looked into the man’s eyes for a moment.</p><p>He had probably mistaken me for some prostitute working in this bath, so I had returned him a cold gaze. As soon as we made eye contact he had taken a step back.</p><p>It seems that there was a peculiar murderous intent hidden in my eyes. There were not a lot of people who were able to stare me straight in the face. As the person directly involved, I didn’t understand&nbsp;that well.</p><p>“S-Sorry. I mistook you for someone else. Have a nice day!”</p><p>The man hastily ran back out to the halls.</p><p>His fleshy waist shook violently as he ran. It was pathetic. How could he have expected to buy me&nbsp;with 3 silver coins with a body like that. At the very least 10 gold. If he did not offer that much then an exchange itself couldn’t possibly be established. No matter how I looked, men who couldn’t judge their appearance objectively were all shabby.</p><p>I turned my steps towards the clinic of the hot springs. There were many patients here who got admitted believing in the effects of the hot springs. If perhaps, in a one in a million chance, his highness Dantalian’s prediction about the disease was correct, then this was the starting point.</p><p>“Ah. What can we do for you, ma’am?”</p><p>The doctors welcomed me. They thought I was the daughter of some noble family. That a pure maiden, ignorant of worldly affairs, was coming to do volunteer work. Yes, I had used charm and suggestion magic to purposely delude them.</p><p>“How are the patients?”</p><p>“Well, it’s pretty much the same. Day in, day out they groan and moan about it hurting. Truthfully speaking, the majority of the patients here are completely fine.”</p><p>“I’d like to meet the most recent patient.”</p><p>“There’s a bloke who was brought in just yesterday. But I don’t really recommend for you&nbsp;to visit him, miss.”</p><p>“Is there a reason?”</p><p>“Yeah. This guy’s fake illness is rather serious. My armpit hurts, my groin feels like it’s ripping, and so on. Talk about fussing over nothing. You’ll detest it, miss.”</p><p>“……”</p><p><em><strong>Joint pain</strong></em></p><p>“……no. That is alright. If it’s a patient, then I’d like to trust his words for now. I’d like to meet that person first.”</p><p>“Haa. How good-natured of you. I may be a petty doctor, but it’s been a long&nbsp;time since I’ve met someone as sincere as you, miss.”</p><p>While being delighted, the doctor lead me to the sick ward. As soon as we had opened the door, a patient who was further inside started to holler.</p><p>“Aaah, I’m dying! This merchant for the great land of Syracuse is going to die because of a quack! Towns people! Someone beat that quack up for me!”&nbsp;<em>(TL note: Quack = Fake doctor)</em></p><p>“Gah. He’s like a pig in heat.”</p><p>The doctor sighed.</p><p>I understood why he had warned me about visiting this patient. The doctor, after taking a quick&nbsp;glance at me first, approached the patient.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“So what’s the problem this time, that’s making you have an epileptic fit?”</p><p>“Problem? What’s my problem? All right, I’ll explain it to you one more time, so this time make sure to carve it into your ear. First, the bed is so hard that my spine is about to become flat. Second, I’m not sure if the servants here are bringing me bread or stones, but my teeth are about to break apart. Third, the long-term doc friend I had keeps sighing whenever he sees my&nbsp;face and&nbsp;that’s starting to&nbsp;make my life&nbsp;miserable.”</p><p>“You, moron. My life is becoming miserable because of you.”</p><p>“Yeah? Good. We have finally reached the point where we make each other miserable. But that’s the same with the misses as well. My wife and I have been at each others throat for a while now, and at this point we’re only thinking of ways to screw with each other. Oi, pal. If you aren’t planning to become my second wife, then shit! Hurry up and act like a doctor and fix me up!”</p><p>“Damn it. This guy isn’t even helpful in life.”</p><p>It seemed&nbsp;that&nbsp;these two had been friends since they were kids.</p><p>It meant that they were close enough to be able to freely swear at each other’s faces.</p><p>It was a&nbsp;strange&nbsp;scene for someone like myself. Friendship. Could that actually exist?</p><p>Commonly, people would praise that friendships last forever. It was suspicious. No matter what sentence, whenever the adverb ‘forever’ was included, then I’d start off by being doubtful. I personally thought this was a good habit.</p><p>There were only backstabbers or potential backstabbers that existed in the world. That was my opinion. Friendship simply referred to a person who hadn’t betrayed you yet.</p><p>“Sorry, miss.”</p><p>The doctor abruptly apologized.</p><p>“This guy always had a crude mouth. Just think of it as his limit of education and ignore&nbsp;it if you can.”</p><p>“I am okay. Please proceed with the&nbsp;checkup.”</p><p>“Okay then.”</p><p>The doctor placed his hand on the patient’s forehead.</p><p>“Places here and there are indeed hot. But no matter how I see it, it’s just a summer cold. I’ll prescribe you with some medicine, so if it does get bad then take the medicine. Other than that you should be fine, so don’t worry.”</p><p>“……”</p><p><em><strong>High temperature</strong></em></p><p>For an instant, disbelief had crossed my mind.</p><p>…… There was no way. I was over thinking it. Joints aching and having a fever, these were symptoms you could find anywhere. You couldn’t consider something like these to be a sign of a disease.</p><p>“Eh, how do you expect me to believe the words of a quack?”</p><p>“If you keep calling me a quack, I’m going to prescribe you poison instead. If you keep saying something like that so loudly then you’ll be hurting my dignity. You bastard. Are you planning to ruin your childhood friend’s business like this?”</p><p>“It really hurts like hell! Here, look.”</p><p>The patient suddenly pulled his top off.</p><p>The doctor panicked and turned to look at me, but I was the same&nbsp;as ever and stood calmly. I didn’t care about the naked body of a man at all. More than that, there was something else that had caught my gaze.</p><p>The patient’s right chest.</p><p>There was a&nbsp;<strong>black</strong>&nbsp;spot the size of a thumb.</p><p>“…………”</p><p>My entire body went stiff.</p><p>Like a person who was petrified.</p><p>“Ara, what’s this?”</p><p>“There’s no reason to have this bruise if it was a normal cold.”</p><p>“That, well. I guess you’re right……”</p><p>The two didn’t notice my sudden change in mood.</p><p>The doctor and patient were busy discussing with each other.</p><p>“That’s weird. Did you perhaps catch an endemic from someone else?”</p><p>“That’s something you, the doctor, should know. Not the merchant, you quack. If you don’t want to get a job change to an undertaker,&nbsp;then cure me already. If I end up being a corpse by tomorrow then you don’t have to worry about your reputation, because your life as a doctor will be over.”</p><p>“Bah, spitting out annoying words, this dumbass.”</p><p><em><strong>Skin turning black</strong></em></p><p>“…… I just recalled something that I have to do. I shall take my leave.”</p><p>“Ah? Oh, sure. Stay safe.”</p><p>With fast steps, I made my way out of the ward.</p><p>I did not have the leisure to give a proper farewell at the moment.</p><p>The situation.</p><p>I couldn’t understand the situation.</p><p>Turmoil wrapped around my head and shook it violently. What was going on. Surely, you weren’t telling me that a disease was actually starting to run rampant? And for it to&nbsp;also be according to Demon Lord Dantalian’s prediction?</p><p>That was impossible. That was absolutely impossible. The ability to foretell the future only manifested in the smallest amount of the already small amount of saintesses. Even then, the last&nbsp;recognized case of a prophecy coming true was 210 years ago. There was no chance for his highness Dantalian to have such an ability, or it was supposed to be that way. But why?</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>…… I had to be calm. It was too soon to get ahead of myself. At most, it was only one patient. There was still the chance that it was just a coincidence that a patient with the symptoms that matched the nonsense that&nbsp;his highness Dantalian had spouted was here. For starters, I had to visit the other doctors in Syracuse.</p><p>At least 2, no, at least 4 patients had to have the same symptoms before it could be judged as a disease. I must not panic. Prophecies were fantasies that appeared in story books. There was no way they could happen so easily in real life.</p><p>‘But, if his highness Dantalian was right……”</p><p>A simple speculation.</p><p>I had only thought of it for a moment but the back of my neck was already cold.</p><p>His highness Dantalian, claiming they were the cure to the disease, had bought bulks of&nbsp;a certain weed. Naturally, the price of the leaf was incredibly low. Most of the gold was spent&nbsp;on personnel. Due to the exorbitant price, however, the amount of the plant that his highness Dantalian had bought……</p><p>Was no less than&nbsp;<strong>30,000</strong>.</p><p>If those truly were the cure, then no matter how low the price was, they’d sell for at least 2 gold each. Thus,&nbsp;<strong>60,000 gold coins</strong>. That transcended the amount that his highness had initially borrowed.</p><p>No, that was still the situation where&nbsp;the money earned was set to the least. If the contagion were to spread across the entire continent then it could cost 5 gold…… it would reach&nbsp;a preposterous state.&nbsp;An unprecedented amount of chaos would occur.</p><p>No one in the firm would predict this. A blunder among blunders. They will probably find the one responsible to blame, and ten to one, I will end up being that escape goat.</p><p>The goal of becoming an executive in Keuncuska.</p><p>The promise to leave me in charge of the entire region of Dolstat, as well.</p><p>Naturally, all of these will pop&nbsp;like bubbles.</p><p>“……”</p><p>I carefully bit my lips.</p><p>Born in a back alley, I had lived my life scavenging sewers and trash. I had just barely been able to grab hold of an opportunity to escape that hell. I could not let all that go down the drain.</p><p>Certainly, I had hoped that his higness Dantalian would awaken as an actual Demon Lord. However, his awakening was only meant for my success and growth. Thus, I had never considered this situation.</p><p>My feet moved faster on their own.</p><p>On that day alone, I had visited every doctor in the city of Syracuse. And I had no choice but to give an objective conclusion.</p><p>Severe fevers.</p><p>Pain spreading from the joints.</p><p>A symptom where the skin would turn black in areas.</p><p>“……”</p><p>In my hands was the piece of parchment that his highness had handed me. Standing in the center of the city square, I kept staring down at the note for a long time.</p><p>16 clinics in the city of Syracuse.</p><p>29 patients with similar symptoms.</p><p>The next day the patients increased to 56 people.</p><p>25 patients complained of a sharp pain and then died.</p><p>10 days later, the patients in the hot springs that I had visited before had all died. Half a month later, the entire city was filled with the pained cries of the citizens.</p><p>His highness Dantalian’s prediction was correct.</p><p>It was an epidemic.</p><p>An epidemic was going rampant.</p><h4>▯Keuncuska Executive, Miser Goblin, Torukel</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 7, Day&nbsp;16</p><p>Keuncuska Firm, Amstel Branch</p><p>“Sir Torukel, an emergent report has arrived.”</p><p>“Keruruk. You discourteous fellow! Did I not tell you that no matter what happens, to not bother me when her highness Paimon was visiting!”</p><p>A fancy reception room.</p><p>I had gotten upset because of&nbsp;a&nbsp;secretary that had suddenly started pounding&nbsp;on the door.</p><p>Her highness Paimon was sitting across from me, that&nbsp;idiot. She was one of the most precious guests to the Keuncuska Firm. When this person was visiting, be it work or contact, I had forbade everything. This was a problem of common courtesy!</p><p>“Oh dear. This lady is fine, Torukel.”</p><p>Fortunately, her highness had displayed understanding first.</p><p>“It must be quite the urgent matter&nbsp;if he had to come in contact with you immediately.”</p><p>“I sincerely apologize. That secretary normally isn’t like this……”</p><p>“I said that I was fine. This lady will be enjoying the fragrance of the tea, so you may take your time.”</p><p>Her highness Paimon smiled gently.</p><p>I wonder how benevolent this person was. She would always treat me, a lowly merchant, with gentleness. While being moved, I bowed several times.</p><p>Of course, once I had left the reception room, my expression had twisted.</p><p>“You fool. What is it, keruk?”</p><p>“I-I’m sorry.”</p><p>The secretary lowered his&nbsp;head while being nervous.</p><p>Even if you did that, the thought of forgiving you doesn’t come up. How dare he interrupt a meeting with her highness. Having come this far, it wouldn’t even be satisfying to cut his head off. He better be prepared.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“An urgent message had arrived from the firm headquarters. A mage wrote down the information onto a note and has delivered it.”</p><p>“No matter how urgent the message is, the person in that room is her highness Paimon. If the message turns out to be a matter of no importance, then I personally will cut your head off.”</p><p>“S-Sir Torukel……!”</p><p>“Hm.”</p><p>I quickly snatched the note away from the secretary and scanned it. Just like our firm to put importance on efficiency, only brief words were written down. Additionally, it was written in a code that only the executives understood,&nbsp;so&nbsp;I was the sole&nbsp;person&nbsp;here that was able to read it.</p><blockquote><p><strong>An epidemic outbreak.</strong></p><p><strong>Centering the harbors, the plague has spread throughout the entire region of the Sardinia Kingdom.</strong></p><p><strong>It is certain that it will spread to the countries in the vicinity soon.</strong></p><p><strong>Fatality rate: 80%</strong></p></blockquote><p>“What……?”</p><p>Once I had decoded this far, my brows creased.</p><p>For it to say that the fatality rate was 80%. Doesn’t that mean that if 10 people were to catch the disease, then 8 people would die. This wasn’t a normal contagious disease.</p><p>It also stated that it was ‘certain’ that the disease will spread to the countries in the vicinity. This was also serious. It was a rule for merchants to not exaggerate information. In these type of situations, it was normal to write that it was ‘expected’ to spread.</p><p>Surely, Ivar Lodbrok couldn’t have possibly made a mistake on this part……</p><p>Certain? Did it mean that the epidemic was spreading at that much of an incredible rate? This was not good. An ominous premonition was looming over me……</p><p>The following sentences made my pupils stop.</p><blockquote><p><strong>The cure to the disease is in&nbsp;the Demon Lord Dantalian’s&nbsp;possession.</strong></p><p><strong>Currently estimated value, 1,200,000~3,000,000 gold coins.</strong></p><p><strong>All executives are to return to the headquarters immediately.</strong></p></blockquote><p><em>(TL note: I’m not very sure about the value. It might be referring to the amount that Dantalian will make in total. Cause 1,200,000 gold per plant sounds insane)</em></p><p>“…………”</p><p>This didn’t make sense.</p><p>“I-I am sorry. Sir Torukel. I truly am sorry. I too, wanted to wait till her highness Paimon had left before handing this to you.”</p><p>This couldn’t be happening.</p><p>“To tell you the truth, this was a note delivered about an hour ago. &nbsp;But it was branded with the first class classified seal. I thought it’d be troublesome for Sir Torukel if it were to be delayed any further……”</p><p>It was impossible.</p><p>“S-Sir Torukel? Are you listening to me? Sir Torukel……?”</p><h4>▯Keuncuska Firm Owner, Pure-blood&nbsp;Vampire, Ivar Lodbrok</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 7, Day&nbsp;16</p><p>Keuncuska Firm Headquarters, Highest floor</p><p>We were tricked.</p><p>Honestly, I was completely deceived.</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>In a dark room I was drinking wine by myself.</p><p>My glass continued to empty. It meant that I was that deep in thought.Somehow, it felt&nbsp;like I was going to be drinking till late at night, tonight……</p><p>Who was it. Which person was the one to have&nbsp;made Ivar Lodbrok into a fool.</p><p>Demon Lord Dantalian was a small-fry. He lacked the ability to plot such a grandiose plan. Then who was it.</p><p>There was only one answer. The half-breed succubus, that girl was the one who had schemed everything……</p><p>“Lapis Lazuli.”</p><p>While rolling the fragrance of the wine around my mouth, I spoke the girl’s name. Was it just my imagination. The alcohol tasted a bit sweeter.</p><p>The desire to succeed was beautiful. To not be satisfied with one’s current position and continue to aim higher. That was the attitude that everyone should naturally take. That was my thought.</p><p>Except.</p><p>If you show your fangs towards me then the story became different.</p><p>I will now teach Lapis Lazuli a lesson.</p><p>It was unfortunate that I had to stomp on a junior who had such a promising future ahead of them. I was speaking the truth. If you asked what I&nbsp;meant by that, then it was because Lapis Lazuli was going to become a living but not living doll.</p><p>I hold out my glass.</p><p>“Another cup.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>A servant girl poured&nbsp;more&nbsp;wine without a word.</p><p>At a time, this girl too was a promising executive candidate. She was just like Lapis Lazuli. Having a low status, her desire for power was mesmerizing. The beauty of her eyes were&nbsp;peerless. However, the decisive part was that she was a fool. She had revolted against none other than myself.</p><p>The bright eyes that would always shine with intelligence, was now a hazy and achromatic color.</p><p>Having lost her will and conscience, she had dropped down to being a slave doll that obeyed my every command……</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“What a shame. Why is it that all the useful talents can’t resist the temptation to go against me?”</p><p>A sigh came out on its own.</p><p>I had turned my head towards the side, and there my face was reflected by the window. Surprisingly, I was grinning. Uncontainable joy was floating around the corners of my mouth. It appeared as if I was having a fair amount of fun.</p><div></div><p>It was true.</p><p><strong>The fact of it being a shame was a lie.</strong></p><p>What’s there to hide.</p><p>Personally, I was having the most fun I’ve ever had since forever.</p><p>For an unpredictable twist to occur, that was the joys of life.</p><p>To personally be able to trample the junior with a promising career ahead of them, that was the fruits of life.</p><p>To turn that junior into a puppet, and like one would store wine to mature, to store her like a doll in my own personal collection—</p><p>That was the highest of pleasures.</p><p>“Lapis Lazuli.”</p><p>Once again.</p><p>I murmured the name of that beautiful girl.</p><p>I will cut every last hope that you have.</p><p>I will defile you from head to toe.</p><p>Once you fall into despair and begin to flounder, I shall pierce my fangs into your white neck and make you into my slave for eternity.</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>I couldn’t hold back any longer.</p><p>I pushed my teeth into the servant’s neck.</p><p>“……Ah, aah…… aaaah……”</p><p>The servant shuddered slightly.</p><p>Her conscience may had been gone, but her sense of pain remained.</p><p>The fragrance of her blood was like that of a well matured first grade wine.</p><p>I had collected&nbsp;<strong>wine dolls</strong>&nbsp;like her for the past hundreds of years.</p><p>But for the past 60 years, the number of dolls had stopped at 32. Because people had stopped showing defiance towards me. It was a boring time.</p><p>The true owner of the Keuncuska Firm. Richest person in the demon world. One of the three pure vampire to walk this land. All of these were addressed to myself. Young ones brave enough to go against me were extremely rare.</p><p>In that meaning, Lapis Lazuli was the first obstacle to appear in 60 years. She was precious in that regard, and she was also precious as my&nbsp;33rd wine.</p><p>…… Now that I thought about it. In my collection there was an elf, a witch, a werewolf, a centaur, a mermaid, and more. I had all kinds of races but not a succubus. Thus, Lapis Lazuli’s value as a collection piece was higher.</p><p>I do wonder what fragrance of wine she’ll&nbsp;give off.</p><p>I sucked the blood of the servant until she had fainted and laughed.</p><p>Keuncuska, oh great Keuncuska.</p><p>You shall repay blood with blood.</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 7, Day 16</p><p>Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle</p><p>Life was beautiful.</p><p>To the point that, I, the most pessimistic person in history, should slowly start to admit that the world was beautiful as well.</p><p>According to the setting in Dungeon Attack, Demons Lords did not have parents. If you were asking what I was talking about, I was referring to the fact that Demon Lords were born from magical energy abnormally gathered at a single point. Purely made by&nbsp;chance. Their birth had nothing to do with having a good personality or being talented, it all relied on luck……</p><p>That was why people couldn’t help but look down on them.</p><p>It was like a competent peasant scorning an incompetent noble. People who had reached the top through their talent and ability alone looked down on Demon Lords. ‘They were only born as a Demon Lord by chance anyways. They wouldn’t be a challenge if you faced them&nbsp;heads on.’, was what they’d say.</p><p>They were carelessly letting their guards down.</p><p>And it was fatal for someone to drop their guard, for even a second, around someone as villainous&nbsp;as I was.</p><p>There were only two cases where I’d think that the world was beautiful.</p><p>First, it was when I did absolutely nothing and rolled around on my bed.</p><p>The&nbsp;second, was when I stabbed a dagger into the&nbsp;people who underestimated me on their own. During these times were when I felt like I understood the true meaning of life.</p><p>…… My little sister said that this was a perverted preference and fiercely denounced it. But I didn’t get her. Was it not the person who lowered their guards that were&nbsp;at fault?</p><p>When a lion hunts a rabbit, they put their all into the hunt. That was why hunting was an incredibly tiring job. If you were not going to do your best from the beginning, then it was better off not starting the work&nbsp;in the first place. Half-assed work only returned half-assed results. It would be more efficient to&nbsp;just be like me and laze around all day and save energy.</p><p>If one had to endure their laziness and go hunting, then in one hit.</p><p>Kill the game off without giving it a single chance to resist.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Currently, the results of that was spread before me.</p><p>“Ooh, Lala. Your complexion looks rather dark today.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli was standing silently.</p><p>Her expression wasn’t as sharp as it used to be. The eyes of hers, which used to be as transparent&nbsp;as glass, were unclear now. They were eyes that I had seen a countless number of times before, the eyes of a defeated person.</p><p>“Is it perhaps, that? The magical spell that falls upon women every month? You too, have a rough life.”</p><p>“…… how did your highness predict this.”</p><p>“Oh dear, Lala. I can hear impatience in your words.”</p><p>Like the reclining Buddha statue, I was lying while supporting my head with my arm.<em>(TL note:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.siiren.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1st-buddha.jpg\">This</a>&nbsp;pose)</em></p><p>“Always cool-headed and calm, that is your charm. Please do show some more consideration to your beauty.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli’s complexion grew darker.</p><p>A pitiful fellow.</p><p>Regardless, I rather liked mentally tantalizing the loser. Please partake in my ridiculing a bit longer.</p><p>“What is the reaction from the Keuncuska Firm?”</p><p>“…… It was&nbsp;like a stirred bee hive. A call up order for all the executives was sent out only a few hours ago. This one had also received the summon to come to the headquarters immediately.”</p><p>“Oh ho. Then why are you here instead of going to the firm?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli didn’t respond.</p><p>No, it would be correct to say that she wasn’t able to respond.</p><p>I smiled slyly.</p><p>“Should I guess what you’re thinking? You had judged that your life would be in danger if you were to go to the firm now. The firm executives have no idea&nbsp;that I was the one to have planned all of this. In their minds, the culprit to this incident was you, Lapis Lazuli.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli glared at me.</p><p>Like a wounded beast staring with hatred at their hunter in the last moment.</p><p>“Was that why your highness had sent this one to Syracuse? To plant a misunderstanding in the firm executives. This one, on purpose.”</p><p>“Correct.”</p><p>If you thought logically, then the act of predicting a plague was impossible.&nbsp;<strong>Someone</strong>, mobilizing unknown methods, had spread the disease in Syracuse on purpose. That was the normal conclusion people would come to.</p><p>Who could that person be.</p><p>Who would the firm executives point their fingers at, as the criminal.</p><p>“The person to become the concubine of a Demon Lord and entice him, was also you.”</p><p>There was one woman who had captivated Dantalian with their body.</p><p>“The one to have seduced the Demon Lord into borrowing a large amount of gold from the firm, was also you.”</p><p>There was one woman who had passionately convinced the executives that it was the perfect opportunity&nbsp;to put a collar on the Demon Lord.</p><p>“Coincidentally, the person to have stayed in the area where the disease had first spread, for a week at that, was also you.</p><p>There was one woman who had first reported exactly where the Black Death outbreak initially&nbsp;occured—.</p><p>“Finally, the person to have bought several thousands of the plant that could cure said disease, was none other than you.”</p><p>That was so.</p><p>Just for this, I had left all the detailed affairs to Lapis Lazuli. The meeting of the small firms and pharmacy, and also the process of buying the plant. All the paperwork was done through Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>Now then.</p><p>“Now your firm executives have no other choice but to suspect you as the prime suspect.”</p><p>The most that Demon Lord Dantalian was, in this act, was a puppet controlled by the succubus. The one pulling the strings was the half-breed, Lapis Lazuli, was what all the executives would assume.</p><p>Although they were completely wrong.</p><p>I chuckled.</p><p>“Lala, you should&nbsp;have thought this far as well. That’s why you came here instead of returning to your headquarters. A good judgment. If you had gone to your headquarters you would have been punished, no questions asked.”</p><p>Silence took over for a moment.</p><p>In a ruin-like Demon Lord room, previously destroyed by adventurers, excluding the bed the room was full of dust and rubbish, in this grey room, Lapis Lazuli was the first to break the silence.</p><p>“…… why?”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli slowly opened her mouth.</p><p>“Why was your highness revealing everything to this one?”</p><p>“Because I evaluate you very highly, Lala.”</p><p>I stood from my bed.</p><p>“You are beautiful. I’m not complimenting your looks. I’m referring to your inner beauty.”</p><p>Rolling my snake-like tongue, I approached Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>“Despite being born a half-breed outcast, you did not throw away your passion for authority. You even tried to sacrifice a Demon Lord for your own success. Just one more step. If you were able to take one more step, you could have become an executive at Keuncuska……”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>An unusual amount of lust for power.</p><p>Cool-headedness that did not fear sacrifice.</p><p>Adding to that, talent that leaped over one’s origin and rank.</p><p>“I want to obtain you.”</p><p>I lifted Lapis Lazuli’s chin.</p><p>Endlessly blue eyes looked up at me.</p><p>“Abandon the Keuncuska Firm and come under my command. Keuncuska, in the end, is nothing more than a&nbsp;firm. Money may be great but it is not greater than authority. The thing that truly excites and enthuses people is authority.”</p><p>“…… Your highness has only just succeeded.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli spoke quietly.</p><p>Our faces were so close that we could feel each others’ breaths.</p><p>“Of course, your highness will make a lot of money. However, there won’t be any authority there yet. Your highness is still rank 71st, the lowest Demon Lord, there is no adequate foundation. How does your highness plan to present authority to this one?”</p><p>“I shall leave all the trading&nbsp;of the cure to you.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli hesitated.</p><p>I slowly moved my face closer to hers. I did not rush. She was already caught in the center of the spider web. She could not run away.</p><p>“Close your eyes. Imagine. The continent will scream as the nightmare like plague&nbsp;envelopes over it. No matter how short it lasts, 2 years. If it goes on longer, then over 5 years. Hundred and thousands of people, hundreds and thousands of people will die off. Among them there will be nobles and the rich. They, in order to stay alive, will do whatever they can to struggle.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli, listening to my order, closed her eyes.</p><p>In a soft voice, I whispered into her ear.</p><p>“This cure that will allow you to control these people’s lives, I shall give it to you.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Countless number of people in power will run to you in order to trade. If you sell the cure, then those people in power will live. If you don’t sell the cure, then those people in power will meet their end. A single word from you could make numerous authorities delighted, despair, sad, and regret for eternity……”</p><p>I stroke her hip with a hand.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli, albeit weakly, furrowed her brows.</p><p>With my palm, I faintly felt her skin. It was a smooth body with no useless fat. As if I was searching through the unknown, I passed my hand over here and there of her body.</p><p>From her chest to her stomach.</p><p>From her stomach to her waist.</p><p>“Half-breed. The rubbish of demons. Daughter of a whore. An outcast. You who used to be condemned by these names and scorned will instantly grasp the lives of hundreds and thousands of people. How is it, Lala. How is that feeling, Lapis Lazuli.”</p><p>It was then, I felt something hard against my finger.</p><p>I found it.</p><p>“The thing you’re feeling right now,&nbsp;<strong>that is authority.</strong>”</p><p>I daringly pushed my hand into her clothes.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli furrowed her brows further. Did she think that she would be violated here? While being all smiles, I pulled out the round metallic object that was hidden&nbsp;underneath&nbsp;the waist of Lapis Lazuli’s clothes. Once I did so, Lapis Lazuli let out an “ah” sound while opening her mouth. It was a look of surprise.</p><p>It was silver-colored metal object.</p><p>At first glance it appeared to be a pocket watch. But if it was a real watch, then the key used to coil around the clockwork was supposed to be connected to the watch. This object didn’t have a watch chain.</p><p>“This is why I evaluate you highly.”</p><p>I playfully waved the metallic object in front of her eyes.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli bit her lips.</p><p>“…… Did your highness perhaps know from the start?”</p><p>“Well, it was a simple guess.”</p><p>Memory Play, a magic artifact.</p><p>It was a type of recording device that recorded audio and saved it. If the quality was good, then it could even record videos like a video camera.</p><p>This was an item that sold for a tremendous price in Dungeon Attack. It was most likely the same in this world as well.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli most likely wanted to prove her innocence to the firm executives. The problem was that she didn’t have any proof. Thus, Lapis Lazuli was going to make new evidence……</p><p>What evidence could&nbsp;prove her innocence. The most effective way would obviously be to get the confession from&nbsp;the actual culprit. There was no doubt that she would mobilize the use of&nbsp;the Memory Play artifact.</p><p>“It is sad. Mm, it has become quite unfortunate. If you did well, there was still the chance to become a proud branch manager in the Keuncuska Firm, but. Oh goodness. Would you look at that—.”</p><p>I dropped the silver object to the floor.</p><p>And then, raising my right foot, I stomped down using the heel of my boot.</p><p>With a ‘crack’, you could hear the precise sound of mechanical parts breaking. I repeated the action 5 times. I then picked up the already wrecked device and tossed it as hard as I could at a wall.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I shrugged.</p><p>“It seems your last possibility has broken.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Lala. You have two choices in front of you. These are choices that you can not refuse. First choice. Like this, abide to your summon from the firm and return with no evidence. Earnestly plea&nbsp;your innocence there. Then, hm. Then…… if you’re lucky then you might be able to keep your life.”</p><p>I softly tapped her shoulder.</p><p>“…… What is the second choice?”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli spoke. It was splendid. Despite being checkmated her voice was still cold. No matter what desperate situation this girl was in, even if her life was on the line, it was clear as day that she would maintain calmness.</p><p>Like I did three months ago.</p><p>While surrounded by adventurers.</p><p>“Come under my wing. Lapis Lazuli. Oh, half-breed low one. If you devote to me your talent, then I will provide you status. If you devote to me your loyalty, then I shall give you power. I will make true the hopes and desires that you contain in your chest on this land, and you shall protect me from the hopes and desires of other people.”</p><p>In brief, give and take.</p><p>Was this not the most loveable logic.</p><p>“What will your highness do if this one was to betray your highness.”</p><p>“Ah, don’t be mistaken. I am not asking for absolute loyalty from you. If you wish to betray me, then do so. If you think someone other than myself will be able to give you more benefits, then of course you should.”</p><p>I did not believe in friendship.</p><p>I did not believe in love more.</p><p>Similarly, I did not have any trust in loyalty.</p><p>“But I will promise you this, you will enjoy to the fullest the highest power of authority.”</p><p>What I did believe in was equivalent exchange.</p><p>The act of reasonable people exchanging items of the same value.</p><p>“……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli stared at me. I did not avoid her eyes. Silence was only awkward when there was no meaning in each others’ eyes. We still had much to figure out from each others’ gaze.</p><p>I had something inside of myself.</p><p>And she as well, had something hidden inside of her.</p><p>We had no reason to fear silence.</p><p>At last.</p><p>“I understand, your highness.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli got down onto one knee.</p><p>She looked to the floor and vowed.</p><p>“I, Lapis Lazuli. Born from a Humbaba succubus and raised in the back alleys of towns and cities, a person to have worked as a third degree merchant for the Keuncuska Firm for 10 years, shall forget her past and live solely for the purpose of being Demon Lord Dantalian’s subordinate. This heart. This head. This soul, shall forever be in the possession of your highness.”</p><p>As soon as her oath of fealty was over several notices appeared.</p><p><strong>[Lapis Lazuli has been recruited as a subordinate.]</strong></p><p><strong>[The degree of loyalty will appear in Lapis Lazuli’s status.]</strong></p><p><strong>[Unstable loyalty. The other party purely regards you as a lord contractually. The other party can betray you at any time.]</strong></p><p>I smiled.</p><p>I especially took fancy the line of being betrayed at any moment. Be it sticky friendship or eternal affection, instead of high-flown lines like those, that line was more trustworthy.</p><p>The undying love that my father had vowed with my mothers, in the end, met with failure. Humans didn’t have the strength to revere that kind of love. To dump emotions that you both can’t handle onto one another will only&nbsp;bend your knees.</p><p>Dry from the start.</p><p>Instead of being bothered by such useless things, I’d rather be lazy.</p><p>Instead of being crudely serious, I’d rather be seriously crude.</p><p>This was my creed, my ironclad rules.</p><p>All of a sudden, from my memories, my father’s thick lips moved clearly.</p><p>‘Son. Be prepared.’</p><p>‘No matter what you choose—’</p><p>‘You will live a life more harsh than I.’</p><p>Sorry, father.</p><p>I do not plan to repeat the life you had.</p><p>You had succeeded as a member of society. However, you had horribly failed as a husband. I had been displeased by that since long ago. Why would you be obsessed with something when you know you would fail?</p><p>If you weren’t certain to succeed then don’t dive in. That was my answer. It meant that&nbsp;people wouldn’t have to be in despair because of me. You were the one remorse in my life, father. I do not want&nbsp;to be the remorse of another person……</p><p>“Good. Lapis Lazuli.”</p><p>I got on my knee as well to match her eye level.</p><p>We were not simply lord and vassal. Contractor and contractor. We were partners made on a promise of equal rights.I wanted to express that to her with my body.</p><p>“I, Dantalian, shall never return thy advice with silence and shall never return thy suggestions with scorn. If thy&nbsp;sweat and bleed for my behalf, then I shall repay every drop of sweat and blood.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I held her hand tightly.</p><p>I had felt it before, but her hand really was soft.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli, after looking at me for a long time, slightly, ever so slightly nodded her head.</p><p>“…… My service to you, your highness.”</p><p>Three months since having fallen into this world.</p><p>I had appointed my first vassal.</p><h4>▯Keuncuska Executive, Miser Goblin, Torukel</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 7, Day 20</p><p>Keuncuska Firm&nbsp;Headquarters</p><p>The firm headquarters was more unsettled than usual.</p><p>Goblins were looking deeply into crystal balls and deciphering codes. And with the deciphered codes, they’d write it down on a piece of parchment in one stroke, then passed it on to a fairy.</p><p>Fairies the size of a palm groaned as they moved the parchment. From the operating department to the countermeasure department, distribution department, and the high-officer department. The headquarters&nbsp;was a rather large building, and yet the fairies were moving around so much that traffic congestion could be seen near the ceiling.</p><p>“Reports of a patient being discovered in Cologne!”</p><p>“We’re certain that the plague is following the Rhine River and spreading north.”</p><p>“That made the closure of the Sardinia Kingdom completely useless.”</p><p>“The lady of the House of Sforza has fallen due to illness……”</p><p>Reports from all over the continent were arriving en masse. Headaches were wrapping around the employees. Among them, there was a goblin that had presumably skipped sleep for the past few days because his eyes were bloodshot and swelling. Keruruk, how pitiful.</p><p>Going through the headquarters, I made my way straight to Ivar Lodbrok’s personal office. For a second, I had thought that I had entered the wrong room. There were so many piles of papers stacked up, that you couldn’t even see the form of Ivar Lodbrok. If I hadn’t heard his gloomy voice over the heaps of papers, then I would have most definitely had left the room.</p><p>“Is that Torukel.”</p><p>“Quite horrible. Keruk.”</p><p>“Oho, is this horrible. But it’s going to be more horrible later. Sit.”</p><p>“…… to sit, where?”</p><p>Of course the desk was out of the question, but there were piles of parchments all over the floor as well.</p><p>“Anywhere is fine. I have already put&nbsp;all the information over there in my head, anyways.”</p><p>“A freakish&nbsp;memorizing ability as ever…… So, is the plague showing any signs of dying down?”</p><p>“Not at all.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok replied instantly.</p><p>“The disease is spreading at a terrifying speed. Kalmar Union and Kingdom of Moscow, excluding Venetia, are all eroding to the plague. The remaining countries will also face the disease very soon. Our firm analysts are already predicting a 30% casualty.”</p><p>“30% of the entire continet are going to die? Are you joking?”</p><p>“If I had ever told a joke in my entire life, do tell.”</p><p>I unintentionally murmured to myself. 30%. It was unimaginable. It meant that millions of demons and humans will die. I couldn’t even speculate how bad the damage was going to be.</p><p>“Every lord has temporarily ceased all trade with our firm.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok spoke in a tone as if he was enjoying something.</p><p>Was he going to keep up with his jovial attitude even in this situation? He really wasn’t sane. Wait, more important than that, did he just say that every lord had ceased trades with us.</p><p>“Isn’t that a big deal!?”</p><p>“Aah, it is a big deal. They are afraid that we will deliver not only the product but the disease as well. Due to that, the items we had prepared for a long time now are waiting in the cargos and storages only to&nbsp;rot.”</p><p>“Don’t tell me the other firms too……”</p><p>“They are the same. All commerce has stopped.”</p><p>It was an unprecedented crisis.</p><p>This plague wasn’t bringing harm to solely mankind. The economy itself on the continent was breaking down. That’s why it didn’t matter if you caught the disease or not, this was no different from everyone rushing straight to hell.</p><p>Once my face turned blue, Ivar Lodbrok changed his tone to be serious.</p><p>“Us demons at least have better circumstances. Since, different from humans, we have studied black magic for hundreds and thousands of years. We have an understanding on how to handle diseases and keep the damage to a minimum. However, humans are different. They had banned black magic on a national degree. Thus, they are&nbsp;overwhelmingly lacking in&nbsp;experience and information. For them, not 30% but 40%. It could even possibly go up to 50%.”</p><p>“Oh, Lord. Goddesses……”</p><p>“The problem was how Lapis Lazuli had predicted this epidemic.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok took a pipe out from underneath his clothes.</p><p>He started to mutter while pressing tobacco into the chamber of his pipe.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“To know what the cure of the disease was and claim a monopoly on it. This was not a coincidence. There’s no doubt that this plague was made artificially.”</p><p>“Are you saying…… that someone had spread this disease on purpose?”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok nodded.</p><p>But was that possible? Lapis Lazuli was merely a half-breed succubus. She did not have the ability to make this kind of disease on her own. No, there was no one on the entire continent that was capable of doing this.</p><p>As if he had read my mind, Ivar Lodbrok spoke.</p><p>“If you thought with common-sense, then it’s an impossible tale. However, if it was Demon Lord Barbatos, then it is&nbsp;possible.”</p><p>“Demon Lord Barbatos……”</p><p>Rank 8th Demon Lord.</p><p>She was known as the greatest warlock on the continent and was also referred to as the&nbsp;Immortal Monarch.</p><p>The army that Demon Lord Barbatos lead consisted entirely of 5,000 undeads. They were corpses that had died long ago. If it was Barbatos, the maestro of black magic and diseases, then she could have created a plague like this. Was what Ivar Lodbrok had concluded……</p><p>That meant that Lapis Lazuli was Barbatos’ pawn.</p><p>Dantalian was just the&nbsp;fake bait displayed at the front.</p><p>Was the true perpetrator Barbatos? Was that it. Was this the truth……</p><p>“This is not a baseless assumption. Demon Lord Barbatos has always despised humans. If there were to be an outbreak, then the damage on the human side will heavily outweigh the damage on the demons. This was obvious.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok continued to speak in a composed manner.</p><p>“Therefore, it wouldn’t be weird if Demon Lord Barbatos was aiming to exterminate the human race with an epidemic. It would be more appropriate to compliment that rational assumption.”</p><p>“……That is horrible.”</p><p>I now understood why Ivar Lodbrok had told me that it was going to be more horrible&nbsp;later.</p><p>To spread an epidemic just to simply get rid of a single race. Escaping all rationality, this was an unforgivable crime. The thought, ‘Could people actually become this villainous’ floated through my mind and gave me the&nbsp;urge to vomit.</p><p>“Demon Lords, in the end, are that kind of character. In order to make their dreams a reality, they do not care about fair means or fouls. It has been like this for thousands of years.”</p><p>“……Should we be standing here without a word? While millions of people cry out in agony, Barbatos, Dantalian, and Lapis Lazuli are in cahoots. Retaliation is required.”</p><p>“I share that opinion. Torukel. Look at this.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok flicked his finger.</p><p>A certain scroll on his&nbsp;desk lifted up in mid-air and flew towards me. Receiving the scroll, I spread it out left and right.</p><p>On the parchment, it was written that in one month time all the Demon Lords were to&nbsp;gather together to hold a meeting. It was called Walpurgis Night.</p><p>The location, Niflheim— as it so happens, it was the city our Keuncuska Firm headquarter was located in. It was okay to look at this as a golden opportunity.</p><p>“Keruk. It’s the big meeting that only happens every&nbsp;several years.”</p><p>“It is most likely to create a countermeasure for the plague. Demon Lord Dantalian will also be attending. Ten to one, that little succubus will come along with him. We will end those two there.”</p><p>But.</p><p>In the deduction that Demon Lord Barbatos was the true culprit, we still had no proof. However, if we threatened either Dantalian or Lapis Lazuli and then tortured them, then we’d be able to gain whatever evidence we required.</p><p>“Tell me what I should do, Lodbrok.”</p><p>Especially Lapis Lazuli. This girl, I could not be forgive.</p><p>Despite the fact that we had summoned her, Lapis Lazuli had not responded. Contact itself was cut off. There was no other choice but to see this as a clear betrayal to the firm.</p><p>For her to forget about the grace we had provided for her by taking her in.</p><p>A punishment must be ordered at once.</p><p>“For now, I will get in contact with Dantalian. Torukel. You go to her highness Paimon and make a request.”</p><p>“……To her highness Paimon?”</p><p>“The culprit is Barbatos. Only her highness Paimon could face against her.”</p><p>I nodded my head.</p><p>It was renown that Barbatos and her highness Paimon were on bad terms. If it meant to get a free hit on Barbatos, then her highness Paimon would not refuse.</p><p>Oh, great Keuncuska.</p><p>You shall repay blood with blood.</p>"

The reason Caesar was assassinated was because he had uselessly wandered around outside.</p><p>The most memorable death was that of philosopher Rene Descartes. This man originally spent his time taking naps, however, his superior had suddenly ordered him to ‘come to work by 5am’, and thus resulted in Rene Descartes dying of overwork. After learning of&nbsp;such historical tragedy, I had come to a conclusion at a young age: Never go outside. Then your safety will be certain.</p><p>History scholars&nbsp;would probably gladly give a standing ovation to such a brilliant solution. My name would be forever remembered as the advocate of theory in the history books.</p><p>But, I couldn’t be happy.</p><p>The world was overflowing with people who begrudged geniuses. It may be possible to impress the history scholars, but to receive the admiration of the public was incredibly difficult. Recently, I had been experiencing my mornings gloomily, like a genius being tragically eaten alive by the jealously and envy of the people……</p><p>“Your highness Dantalian.”</p><p>The culprit to create this tragedy was Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>Ironically, she was my first vassal.</p><p>“It is already 11am. Please wake up.”</p><p>“Mm, mmm…… is 11am not still the crack of dawn……?”</p><p>“This one does&nbsp;not know where to raise an argument first. If this one had to point out one thing then it is that 11am absolutely is not dawn.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli spoke calmly.</p><p>This inflexible succubus, representing the people, did her utmost to interfere with my shut-in life. I think she had mistaken that doing so was her duty by fate.</p><p>I groaned as if I was a politician being assaulted by the nasty media.</p><p>“Who, with what right,&nbsp;said&nbsp;that 11am is not dawn……?”</p><p>“Sound common sense decided so.”</p><p>I pulled my blanket over my head.</p><p>To want to take me away from this comfortable feeling. If this wasn’t an unimaginable violence, then I didn’t know what it was. Not only was that succubus’ period getting worse, but there was a loose screw in her head, I was certain.</p><p>“Most people have a mental sickness. Common sense is nothing more than rules that those mental people had arranged on their own. Therefore, rules for a mental hospital. As a unique sane individual, such as myself, I shall not fall to the pressure of those psychopaths……”</p><p>“Haa. Your highness has been sleeping for&nbsp;<strong>22 hours</strong>&nbsp;now.”</p><p>Show some moderation and get up.</p><p>Was the small warning I could hear from her voice.</p><p>I hugged my pillow even tighter, displaying my will to resist desperately.</p><p>“Stop thinking so firmly. The world won’t come to an end. And since it isn’t, then it’s better off getting in 10 more minutes of sleep.”</p><p>“…… Did your highness mention the end of the world just for 10 more minutes of sleep? This one cannot help but be amazed by your highness’ extraordinary leap in logic.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli spoke as if she was dumbfounded.</p><p>“It is a conceptual shift. I live life to the fullest everyday as if it was my&nbsp;last. In short, I do my very best to be lazy.”</p><p>“This one had never imagined&nbsp;that the word lazy and the word best had such a close relation to one another. No matter how much this one looked, your highness’ use of words is always marvelous.”</p><p><em>Tack</em></p><p>The sound of a finger snapping could be heard over my blanket.</p><p>The moment after, my blanket started to move restlessly and then rose up by itself. It was magic. I hurriedly reached up and tried to at least grab the edge of my blanket, but it&nbsp;was in vain.</p><p>“Ah, aah! Wait!”</p><p>“Please sleep moderately. &nbsp;There is no need to sleep excessively in one’s life. Even if one were to die, then wouldn’t they be able to sleep for all of eternity in their grave?”</p><p>The blanket was sent flying across the entire room.</p><p>I glared fiercely at Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>“Magic is cheating!”</p><p>“This one had thought that your highness loved cheating.”</p><p>“The only one allowed to cheat in this world is me. It’s only appropriate for&nbsp;everyone else to live life being fair and square. That way I’ll be able to gain profit whenever I want, is that not right!?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“By the looks of it, it seems that this one might have chosen the wrong lord to serve……”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli let out a small sigh.</p><p>“Your highness. The Walpurgis Night will be held on the day after tomorrow. If we do not depart now, then we may end up not being able to attend the meeting.”</p><p>“Not attend. That’s good. Not attend. Truthfully, that&nbsp;has a beautiful ring to it.”</p><p>“You cannot. If your highness Dantalian is absent from the plague countermeasure meeting, while being in possession of a mass amount of the cure, then your highness will receive heavy criticism and be berated. If it means to protect your highness’ honor, then this one is prepared to use drastic measures.”</p><p>“Hoo. You’re coming on rather strong.”</p><p>I snorted.</p><p>“Sorry, but I don’t have parents or a family, nor do I even have a childhood friend that was separated from me at a young age. In other words, I’m the&nbsp;<strong>absolute strongest</strong>! How you plan to bring down I, Demon Lord Dantalian, when he doesn’t&nbsp;have a single weakness, is something I wish to see. Go ahead, use that drastic measure that you seem to be so proud of.”</p><p>“Yes. Then as this one is ordered to.”</p><p><em>Taack</em></p><p>Lapis Lazuli snapped her finger again.</p><p>The pillow that was held tightly between my arms had smoothly slipped out of my grasp.</p><p>“Nooooooooo!?”</p><p>“Then. This one has done as your highness has commanded.”</p><p>“Why are you slyly lifting your chin up proudly!? Return my pillow immediately! That is not a simple pillow! That is my&nbsp;<strong>soul</strong>. That is a part of my soul!”</p><p>“My apologies.”</p><p>It was then, with a ‘poof’, the pillow exploded.</p><p>White feathers rained down.</p><p>“My pretty soul—!?”&nbsp;<em>(TL note: He says this in English)</em></p><p>I screamed.</p><p>Like a hero who had just lost his childhood friend(engaged&nbsp;• 2 months pregnant) that was a mage&nbsp;to the Demon Lord, my body shook violently.</p><p>“The soul has died.”</p><p>“You Devil!”</p><p>“It is fine to call this one a Devil. With Devil like ways, this one shall make your highness get up. Even if your highness was to punish this one, this one shall remain loyal till the very end.”</p><p>“Why is your side the one being conceited!?&nbsp;Has our positions not switched!?”</p><p>“Apologies. Since this one is, in reality, quite the distinguished subject to your lord.”</p><p>“It sounds like your repenting but it actually sounds annoying……!?”</p><p>“It has been one month since this one has been appointed to your highness Dantalian. During that short period of time, this one had met with no more than 72 firms and sold the cure to the disease. In order to purposely sell the black herb at a high price, this one had released the supply slowly, thus allowing this one to sell the herb for an extraordinary price of 10 gold a piece. Due to this, there is a total of 500,000 Libra&nbsp;in your highness’ vault. There are still over 25,000 herbs that we have yet to sell. This trade, with no doubt, will go down in history.”&nbsp;<em>(TL note: The author made a mistake here. 10 x 5000 = 50,000, so he actually has 50,000 libra in his vault. The mistake is fixed later by the author)</em></p><p>“You really are distinguished……!?”</p><p>“That is so. One could say that this one was&nbsp;on a different dimension to your highness, who had spent the past month philandering with a pillow.”</p><p>I thought it was more impressive in another meaning that Lapis Lazuli could speak from start to finish with a completely stoic face. Really.</p><p>If I recalled correctly, in &lt;Dungeon Attack&gt;, the annual income of the Imperials in the Habsburg Empire was 500,000 gold. Lapis Lazuli was able to earn an amount similar to that in only a month.</p><p>Honestly, I admitted that she had an enormous ability.</p><p>If she had not interfered with my sleep, then I would have even patted her head.</p><p>However, she had not only plundered me of my blanket, but she had destroyed my pillow as well— Lapis Lazuli had done something irreparable and had crossed the Rubicon River.</p><p>Compromise was impossible.</p><p>I, as a proud member of the Roman&nbsp;Res Republica elder council, sincerely despised the tyrant that didn’t know his place and was trying to become a dictator. It’d be a good idea to celebrate your victory now, Julius Caesar. In the end, you will be stabbed in the back by the child you thought was kind and gentle……</p><p>“…… What should I&nbsp;do. Just because I had destroyed a pillow, the man who I&nbsp;had sworn&nbsp;to serve as my lord is glaring at me&nbsp;as if I&nbsp;was a sworn enemy. Before being troubled, I feel more shocked.”</p><p>“Lala.”</p><p>I warned her seriously.</p><p>“It is fine to use my name in order to gain authority. It is also fine to fill your back pockets&nbsp;as you earn money. There is one thing. Regardless of all that…… it is absolutely unforgivable to treat my pillow with contempt! Do you understand? This is a strict order!”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Lapis Lazuli looked at me.</p><p>She had the&nbsp;eyes of a person looking at unrecyclable industrial waste.</p><h4></h4><h4>▯Mixed Blood, Lapis Lazuli</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 4, Day&nbsp;18</p><p>Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle</p><p>I was able to drag his highness outside.</p><p>According to his highness Dantalian, it has been four months since he had last gone out. Ever since Riff’s adventurer group had invaded, he had shut himself in the cave.</p><p>By any chance, was his highness Dantalian not a Demon Lord but a vampire? I could believe this kind of nonsense right now. One could only be astonished by his highness’ laziness.</p><p>“T-The sun, it’s too strong……!”</p><p>As soon as we had left the cave, his highness screamed.</p><p>Covering his face with his arms, he sunk to the floor.&nbsp;…… Are you a ghoul? Are you the type of undead whose flesh melted when under the sun?</p><p>What was worse was that it wasn’t even the afternoon. It was the evening. The beautiful glow of the setting sun was floating in the sky. Even ghouls with rotten innards would move around energetically during this time of the day. As soon as I had pointed that fact out to his highness, his highness gave me a serious look.</p><p>“How ignorant. Originally, people as weary of life as I am find even the setting sun to be blinding and overwhelming.”</p><p>“That speech may be nice, but the actions done by your highness is the worst.”</p><p>I still can’t believe it that well.</p><p>Was this lazy man truly ‘the’ Dantalian that had&nbsp;vastly toyed with the Keuncuska Firm? It wasn’t some mistake, right?</p><p>A sigh drifted out of my mouth. That was the 21st sigh today. I should be cautious to not let this&nbsp;become a habit.</p><p>“……Originally, using teleportation magic would be the fastest method of transportation. However, because of the plague outbreak, all cities has placed a ban on teleportation. We will be using a different method.”</p><p>“How splendid. To be quickly trying to put countermeasures for the disease, that shows how competent the city management are. I give them my respect. And in that sense, I shall wait patiently for the ban to be lifted.”</p><p>His highness turned his back and tried to move towards the cave entrance.</p><p>However, without being able to take two steps, he stopped. I had grabbed hold of his highness’ cloak beforehand.</p><p>“This one will never let your highness go.”</p><p>“Damn forever-on-her-period succubus.”</p><p>“It does not matter if your highness swears at this one. Does your highness know how many hours it took to drag your highness all the way here?”</p><p>“Uuuuh……”</p><p>“It does not matter if your highness makes a pitiable face&nbsp;as well.&nbsp;In the first place, a pitiful expression does not fit your highness. Please restrain&nbsp;yourself from ever doing so&nbsp;again since there is the danger that it will cause the on looking party to vomit.”</p><p>“You really are excessively honest!?”</p><p>I pulled out a pocket watch and checked the time.</p><p>Since teleportation magic wasn’t possible, I had called witches.</p><p>The Berbere sisters. They were one of the 5 talented groups in the demon world. Although, in this day and age, broom travel had become an antique due to teleportation magic, there was no other choice. You had to make do with what you could get……</p><p>“They should be arriving soon.”</p><p>The pocket watch pointed towards 11 hours and 55 minutes.</p><p>This clock interlocked with the other party’s pocket watch. It displayed when the other party would arrive. This was an essential magical tool for busy merchants.</p><p>The starting point was 12 o’clock on the dot. The further they were from your location, the time would change accordingly. If it was 11:55 then it meant that they were 5 minutes away. The witches were going to arrive within 5 minutes.</p><p>And sure enough.</p><p>The sound of a song could be heard. It felt like it came from the sky, but it also felt like it was coming from across the forest that was spread out in front of the cave.</p><p><em>“A dream world, we drift into the magical sky.</em></p><p><em>Spin, all and everything will spin.</em></p><p><em>The planets will spin, the shooting stars will spin, everything will spin.</em></p><p><em>Hand in hand, us witches will also spin.</em></p><p><em>You thrice, I thrice, once more we spin thrice.</em></p><p><em>Get along and add it together and we’d have spun three hundred thirty-three times.”</em></p><p><em>(TL note: I swear this sounds better in Korean…. it doesn’t)</em></p><p>The&nbsp;chorus grew closer.</p><p>At first, it appeared like winter geese were flying across the sky. Except, they were too large to be called geese. In truth, the wings were a cape, and the beak was a broom.</p><p><em>Taak</em></p><p>12 witches landed gracefully.</p><p>All of the witches, in perfect sync, knelt down.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Sacred and inviolable representative that symbolizes absolute dignity, one of the 72 lords that commands an army of demons.”</p><p>Amongst them, the witch that seemed to be the leader spoke.</p><p>It was a girl with short trimmed pale blonde hair.</p><p>“It is more than an honor to be allowed in your highness’ presence.”</p><p>“May the Goddess Hecate’s blessing be upon you all. Raise your heads.”</p><p>His highness Dantalian responded as per courtesy.</p><p>“We will be in your care for the time being. Do take care of us as much as you can.”</p><p>His face was serious. You couldn’t even see a trace of the person who was childishly screaming about how the sun was blinding him earlier. No matter who saw, you could only see a solemn and noble Demon Lord, that was it.</p><p>……I consider that cheating.</p><p>“Yes, great lord. Us Berbere sisters will do our utmost to provide your lordship a comfortable and relaxing trip!</p><p>The witch in charge responded energetically.</p><p>She probably had not&nbsp;noticed his highness Dantalian’s true form to even the slightest amount. Her face was glowing with&nbsp;the self-pride that she was able to serve a Demon Lord. That pureness was enviable……</p><p>While drawing magic circles on the ground, the witches prepared for the travel busily. Their brimmed cone hats were so big that it covered more than 2/3 of their heads. It was cute.</p><p>His highness Dantalian suddenly whispered in my ear.</p><p>“Lala. Are the witches not excessively young?”</p><p>“…… Too close. Your highness, please move away.”</p><p>“Ah. Sorry about that.”</p><p>It was troubling that his highness would get so close to me at times.</p><p>Has he forgotten that I was an outcast?</p><p>Luckily, the witches did not know of my status. Regardless, just the fact that I had whispered with his highness alone was good grounds for a large problem to occur. Demon Lords were sacred and inviolable representatives that symbolized absolute dignity. For me, who used to be a mere peasant, the very action of even conversing with his highness should be impossible. What could he be possibly thinking……</p><p>I sighed and— Oh dear, that was the 22nd sigh—</p><p>I straightened my posture.</p><p>“Do not judge witches by&nbsp;their outer appearance. Once witches make a life contract with a Demon Lord, all of their bodily growth stops for eternity. If they appear young, then it meant that they were that talented of an individual&nbsp;and were&nbsp;scouted at a young age.”</p><p>“Ho.”</p><p>It was so.</p><p>In the world of witches, the young did not respect the elderly. It was the complete opposite. The old worshiped the youth. It’d be better to say ‘respect the young’, instead of ‘respect the elderly’.</p><p>All members of the Berbere sisters had the face of young girls. It meant that they were all immensely talented individuals. In addition to that, on their chest was a three-leaf badge. A triphyllous. Thus meaning that they had participated in the Viet war 3 times. Due to the racial division method, the witches would&nbsp;have been on the front lines of the&nbsp;air battles, which was known to have the highest casualty rate. They were the elite of elites.&nbsp;<em>(TL note: Yes, the book does mention the Vietnam war)</em></p><p>I wonder if the preparations had all finished. The leader girl was hopping her way over&nbsp;to us. She was most likely at least 200 years older than I was, and yet, I wonder why she appeared to be so cute…… It was an incomprehensible mystery.</p><p>“Great lord! Great lord! Please sign here!”</p><p>The lead witch courteously held out a parchment.</p><p>“Us Berbere sisters transparently disclose our travel fees to all of our customers. No matter what happens, we do not ask for additional payments later on!”</p><p>The witch, as if she was very proud, broadened her shoulders.</p><p>“……”</p><p>On the other hand, the complexion of his highness Dantalian, as he was looking down at the parchment, was&nbsp;boundlessly dark. What could possibly be written on it that would make him like that. I took a glance over his shoulder.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Berbere&nbsp;Witch Sisters</strong></p><p>We shall always treat out customers honestly and kindly</p><p><strong>*Wind protection magic:&nbsp;</strong>Only 2 gold</p><p><strong>*Temperture control magic:&nbsp;</strong>Only 1 gold</p><p><strong>*Sound control magic:&nbsp;</strong>Small sum of 4 silver</p><p><strong>*Beautiful singing and fantastical scenery magic:&nbsp;</strong>Only 1 gold</p><p><strong>*Hot honey wine that can melt your insides:&nbsp;</strong>Small sum of 2 silver</p><p><strong>*</strong><strong>Each escort:&nbsp;</strong>Only 3 gold x 12 people = 36 gold</p></blockquote><p>Hm.</p><p>It felt a bit expensive, but it was still within the permissible range. We were hiring 12 witches who all had a triphyllous badge. Even if we were paying a somewhat large amount, it was okay.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Hehe. We calculated the price after thoroughly checking the current market.”</p><p>The lead witch must be confident too. She was smiling cheerfully.</p><p>“In total it is 41 gold and 1 silver. In the honor and glory of being able to attend your great lordship, we ‘ll just shave that 1 silver off. 41 gold coins. Aha, if it’s this then it’s almost nothing!”</p><p>“…………”</p><p>Huh?</p><p>The edge of his highness’ mouth had become stiff.</p><p>It was barely enough that only I had noticed it. I couldn’t figure out why he was like this.</p><p>Surely, the person who had made more than 50,000 gold from selling the cure to the disease&nbsp;wouldn’t be stingy about this amount of money. A few days ago he had even wasted 1,600 gold on buying a useless ring……</p><p>“Could you wait a moment. I have something I must discuss with my vassal.”</p><p>His highness Dantalian put the witches behind him. Then, as if he was going to whisper into my ear again, he lowered his head. At this point, I don’t feel like warning him anymore.</p><p>“What is it, your highness.”</p><p>“Why does it cost 41 gold just to get a lift on a broom once? This is a rip-off. This is a rip-off for sure!”</p><p>For a moment, I was speechless.</p><p>To have really been stingy about the money.</p><p>“…… Excuse this one, but that is a fitting, and thus appropriate, employment fee. Please consider the fact that this is not only a transportation fee, but an escort fee as well. 12 of the most elite witches. Even if we were to be assaulted by injustice during the flight, they will easily be able to repel the threat.”</p><p>“Damn, shit. My blood like money……”</p><p>With shaking hands, his highness Dantalian opened his money pouch.</p><p>It was strange.</p><p>Due to my curiosity I couldn’t help but ask him.</p><p>“Your highness. Why is your highness grinding your teeth over&nbsp;some gold coins? There’s 50,000 Libra stored in the vault. And there’s still 25,000 herbs left to be sold. Also, did your highness not readily spend 1,600 gold coins on something recently.”</p><p>“Do you really not understand?”</p><p>His highness Dantalian glared at me.</p><p>His voice was immensely serious. It was the tone he used when he was not being a lazy bum but a cruel level-headed schemer.</p><p>I automatically became nervous. Was there perhaps something that I had missed?</p><p>His highness opened his lips.</p><p>“Does the decrease of my money not mean the less time I’d be able to play at my leisure and not work?”</p><div></div><p>“……eh?”</p><p>I’m sorry.</p><p>I couldn’t hear him correctly.</p><p>“If I were to go into the cave and swing a pickax all day, then I’d earn 1 silver. If I were to try to earn 41 gold, then that meant I’d have to mine for 205 days. 205 days of playing all gone due to one trip!”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Now. Do you understand why I’m being&nbsp;a miser? The ring assisted in providing a comfortable life for myself, so I had held back tears and bought it. How could some trip compare to that!”</p><p>“……”</p><p>It was for a single moment, but.</p><p>His highness Dantalian looked like a larva that was infesting rotten food.</p><p>Was it truly a good idea to serve his highness as a vassal?</p><p>I started to lose confidence in my own decision.</p><h4></h4><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 8, Day 16</p><p>Niflheim, Hermes’ Plaza</p><p>The flight took 8 hours.</p><p>Honestly, it was no different to torture. Once again, I missed the scientific advancements of my original world.</p><p>To sit behind a witch on a broom. In words it sounded simple, but this hurt my buttocks tremendously. After arriving in Niflheim I couldn’t stand properly for fair amount of time. For this kind of trip to be 41 gold. I wanted to demand a refund immediately.</p><p>“Well done everyone. I was considering to buy you all a beer for delivering us here safely,&nbsp;would that be okay?”</p><p>To keep a good face on even in this situation, was the bastard so-called social life. Was it not horrible? Was it not even more horrible that the witches had cheered “Thank you very much!” at my&nbsp;offer?</p><p>We know a good place, the witches said and guided us there.</p><p>The place was a plaza. At the edge of the large plaza, many pubs and bars were lined up together. Even at a slight glance, you could see over 200 customers seated outside and drinking beer. It seemed like all of the bars shared the seats outside.</p><p>“This is the Temple of Hermes&nbsp;Plaza. It is Niflheim’s main tourist attraction. It is also the only place you can drink beer without having to worry about one’s race and social status.”</p><p>The witch chatted pleasantly.</p><p>“This place has taken the name of the Temple of Hermes that was in ruins here. Can your lord see the wreckage over there? That is a vestige of the temple.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“It seems to have been preserved because of some historical value.”</p><p>“Ahaha, my apologies but that is not so. &nbsp;12 years ago a group fight erupted. A bunch of dumb trolls and minotaurs got drunk and started a big fight. Because of that everything became completely devastated. The very next day, the governor of Niflheim created a law that stated,&nbsp;<strong>murder that occurs in a table&nbsp;with more than 7 people gathered, while being drunk, will be declared as innocent</strong>. Well, in other words, it was basically telling people,&nbsp;‘next time you get drunk and decide to start a ruckus, we’re not even going to find the culprit for you, so take care of yourself’.”</p><p>“…… That is a surprisingly novel law.”</p><p>“Our governor is a bit passionate.”</p><p>The witch nodded.</p><p>“In a serious sense, you could say the governor is a person who can display ingenuity. The ruins being left here like so is meant to be a warning.”</p><p>“Don’t mess around?”</p><p>“Something like that—”</p><p>We went to whatever seat was nearby and sat down.</p><p>A palm sized fairy flew over to take our orders. It felt like the fairy was terrified of the witches as they weren’t able to lift their head as smoothly as they did earlier. Witches may have been treated as slaves with their souls taken by Demon Lords, but they also had an incredible power so they couldn’t be treated lightly.</p><p>Shortly after, fairies in a line formation air lifted our beers to us. We each took a&nbsp;glass and lifted it up.</p><p>“You all did a good job today. Despite being attacked by sirens mid-flight, you were able to repel them swiftly. I shall praise that. We were able to arrive here safely all thanks to you sisters. I’d like to make a toast to the Berbere sisters.”</p><p>“”The Berbere sisters!””</p><p><em>Clang</em></p><p>The beer glasses made a satisfying clanging sound as they hit one another.</p><p>The drinking party progressed merrily.</p><p>After finding out that Shakespeare was never born in this world, I immediately went into&nbsp;an impromptu one-man play of &lt;Macbeth&gt; and &lt;Romeo and Juliet&gt;.</p><p>Reciting the lines from start to finish like I did in elementary school was probably difficult to do at this point. But it was easy to put in a decent amount of dramatic effect as I told the story. The witches became entranced as I performed with a face full of sorrow.</p><p>……</p><p>“……Finally, Juliet took Romeo’s hand in her own. A cold hand. There was warmth, but the heat was slowly draining away. Juliet, wanting to feel even the smallest amount of that warmth, placed the back of her lover’s hand against her cheek……”</p><p>“”……””</p><p>All 12 witches were with bated breaths.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli appeared to be composed while holding her beer glass, however, that glass had been empty for quite a while now. Even Lapis Lazuli had been captivated by my improvised play.</p><p>“However, the back of that hand had soon become cold as well. Juliet shed a tear. Aah, where has my lover gone? Why is his body so cold? Desperately, to feel even the smallest amount of warmth, Juliet searched through Romeo’s body.…… but alas, she could no longer find the warmth of her beloved which she had longed for. Aah, Romeo, oh sweet&nbsp;Romeo. I can no longer feel your warmth……”</p><p>“Uh, aah.”</p><p>Tears were starting to brim in the witches’ eyes.</p><p>If you looked around, it wasn’t only our table&nbsp;that was quiet, but the other seats around us were strangely silent as well. I could sense that other people had&nbsp;turned&nbsp;their ears to me.</p><p>I was certain. I was grabbing hold of the hearts of approximately 30 people.</p><p>Modern people already knew full well of the story of &lt;Romeo and Juliet&gt;, thus they weren’t able to get into the story with a fresh feeling. However, these people were different. It was the first time for these people of the demon world to ever hear such an intense love story. Of course, the immersion level would be different if you compared the two.</p><p>Forbidden romance was always a popular theme.</p><p>I drew out a mournful voice.</p><p>“Oh, but what was this? Reaching the end of final moments, Juliet was able to discover a place of warmth from her lover. The lips.&nbsp;There was still a faint feeling of warmth&nbsp;drifting from his mouth. Shedding tears, Juliet pressed her lips against her lover’s. There was nothing more warm…… more tender…… more soft. But, Juliet knew. That the tenderness of her lover’s lips too, will fade away like a midsummer night’s dream.”</p><p>I paused.</p><p>A terrified stillness reigned over the drinking party.</p><p>At the highest zenith.</p><p>After&nbsp;looking at the tears falling from the witches, while pleasantly on the inside, but with a tragic tone on the outside, I continued.</p><p>“Juliet muttered. If this was so, then take action before the warmth has faded. Before witnessing the death of my lover, cover a death with another…… Juliet held up Romeo’s dagger.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Aah, aaah!”</p><p>The witches covered their mouths with their hands.</p><p>They had finally realized the ending of the story.</p><p>Their eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>“Juliet shouted. Oh dagger, it is nice to see you. My heart&nbsp;shall be your sheath!&nbsp;……and Juliet stabbed the dagger deep into her own chest.”</p><p>“Ah, aah!”</p><p>The witches had eventually embraced each other.</p><p>Mm.</p><p>I was incredibly pleased.</p><p>To be able to control people’s emotions with my acting ability. To make them feel sad, happy, hope, and despair, this was what truly gave me a reason to live. The stress that had piled up during our flight here melted like an ice under the sun.</p><p>My second half little sister had heavily criticised me about this before, saying that this was a perverted preference.</p><p>I couldn’t really understand her.</p><p>I was only&nbsp;gifting people with pleasure for free.</p><p>Look carefully. The witches were not able to handle the tragedy and were shuddering, Lapis Lazuli may have still been expressionless, but she was holding onto her glass tightly, and even the drinkers around us were letting out groans. Was this not a beautiful and harmonious scene?</p><p>That was why, I shall make them happier.</p><p>While grinning on the inside, I spoke.</p><p>“Blood flowed from Juliet’s chest. She could feel her own blood. Juliet’s vision started to fade……”</p><p>“N-No.”</p><p>Someone had faintly emitted a moan.</p><p>How could they react so purely.</p><p>Truthfully, it felt worthwhile teasing, no, I mean, being of service to them.</p><p>“……Finally. Juliet pressed her face against Romeo’s body. Her lover’s body was immensely warm. In truth, it was because of the blood flowing from Juliet. However, Juliet, who had already lost all her senses, could only feel it as the tenderness coming from her lover’s body…… &nbsp;A blessing as it was a tragedy. A tragedy as it was a blessing…… Juliet smiled faintly. At last, submerged in her own blood. With her face lied on top of her beloved’s body. Slowly, ever so slowly…… her soft eyes closed.”</p><p>Close curtain.</p><p>END.</p><p>……</p><p>A moment of silence.</p><p><strong>“”Juliet is so pitiful—!””</strong></p><p>The witches shouted together.</p><p>The ending without any hopes or dreams had impacted heavily onto their consciousness. The twelve of them immediately started to voice their complaints.</p><p>“It can’t be! That can’t happen!”</p><p>“Waaah, waaah……”</p><p>“Lord, great lord! The two become happy in the end, right? Some amazing warlock appears with a ‘tadah!’ and revives Romeo and Juliet, right!?”</p><p>I felt gleeful by their fervent cries.</p><p>Thank you for responding so fervidly, audience.</p><p>But the one thing I loved most in the world was showing people, who were&nbsp;chanting for a happy ending, the cruel truth of the hopeless reality.</p><p>“Sadly……that kind of luck never befell those two.”</p><p>“S-Surely?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>The witches had miserable expressions on their faces, as if they were just told the news by the International Union&nbsp;for Conservation of Nature, that&nbsp;sea otters were on the brink of extinction.</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>“Romeo and Juliet, without being able to be revived, died&nbsp;<strong>forever</strong>.”</p><p>“Huaaaaaaang!”</p><p>The witches lamented at the top of their lungs.</p><p>Right now, a scar that would last forever had appeared on their hearts.</p><p>I believed that scars made people grow. In short, by providing them with this single scar, I was also presenting them a stepping stone to grow as an individual. In the distant future, these witches will probably look into the past and thank me. That thanks to his highness Dantalian’s deep consideration, they were able to mature further as a person……</p><p>The results of my education took effect rather quickly.</p><p><strong>[Your devilish performance has captivated the people!]</strong></p><p><strong>[Witch Humbaba’s affection went up by 11.]</strong></p><p><strong>[Witch Stheno’s affection went up by 12.]</strong></p><p><strong>[Witch Euryale’s affection went up by 9.]</strong></p><p>A large amount of notice windows came pouring down.</p><p>Excluding one witch, the affection rate&nbsp;went up for all of them by an incredible amount. There was no doubt. The witches had been deeply moved by my romance stories. As evidence, they kept shedding warm tears.</p><p>“Lady Macbeth, Juliet they……”</p><p>“There’s only dirty travesties in the world……”</p><p>“I’m not going to believe in something like religion now……”</p><p>Was this not amazing?</p><p>This gloomy color of despair was a color that befitted people.</p><p>Like a religious sect leader for a new religion, I was looking down at the young lambs with satisfaction. That was it. Throw away your hopes for the outside world and shut yourself inside. That way everything will be alright.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Lapis Lazuli, who was seated beside me, let out a sigh.</p><p>“This one must admit, your highness is the same as ever.”</p><p>“I know. Consistently being this refreshing is my charm.”</p><p>“This one thinks that your highness consistently being rotten to the core is a fault.”</p><p>“Hoo, that’s why the jealousy of a dull-witted mind is&nbsp;quite vulgar.”</p><p>I raised the corners of my mouth.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli was looking at me with dead eyes.</p><p>It was fine. Her expression may have been like that, but inside, she as well had been moved by my eloquence. It probably wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that she was captivated. It was just that she was embarrassed to display her inner feelings……</p><p><strong>[Lapis Lazuli’s affection went down by 1.]</strong></p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli was much further from being two-faced.</p><p>Be it shyness or embarrassment, these kind of squishy emotions never existed in this impervious&nbsp;succubus in the first place.</p><p>“Hm hm. This time a bit more brighter story……”</p><p>“Ooi! The reception is completely terrible!”</p><p>It was at the moment I had cleared my throat to change the topic.</p><p>On the other side of the plaza came a crashing sound, followed by a noisy racket. Our group, as if we had promised to do so previously, turned our gaze together towards that location.</p><p>“The alcohol tastes terrible, and the seats are hard! You don’t even have any common courtesy towards your customers! To want to receive payment with this, are you actually trying to do business!?”</p><p>“My apologies. My sincere apologies, your highness.”</p><p>A young’un was shouting at an old dwarf.</p><p>The dwarf’s face was covered in wrinkles. His clothes were rather decent. He was most likely the owner of one of the bars. The dwarf was on the ground and bowing his head over and over again.</p><p>“Because our lowly employees were unable to recognize your highness……”</p><p>“Ha. That’s why every old bastard should just die.”</p><p><em>Smack</em></p><p>The young man had kicked the flank of the old dwarf.</p><p>The old man let out a shout and fell over.</p><p>“To try to do business when there’s mold in your brain!”</p><p>Kick.</p><p>“Look at your entertainment, it’s pathetic!”</p><p>Another kick.</p><p>Irrational violence was taking place in public.</p><p>The atmosphere in the plaza became cold. However,&nbsp;there was not even a single person that tried to stop it. As if everyone had made a silent agreement to stay out of the violence that was happening before them.</p><p>The taste of alcohol quickly vanished. The tipsy state I was in for drinking beer had steadily cooled off. It wasn’t a good type of cool&nbsp;feeling, but an unpleasant coolness.</p><p>“Who is that laughable man?”</p><p>“Rank 72nd Demon Lord, Andromalius.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli whispered.</p><p>“Demon Lord?”</p><p>I narrowed my brows.</p><p>Now that I looked carefully, I could see a small horn on that man’s forehead.</p><p>The horn on the back of my head was small enough to be nearly covered by my hair, but that man’s horn was even less than that. If I did not know he was a Demon Lord, I would have mistaken&nbsp;it for&nbsp;some large pimple.</p><p>“Yes. Andromalius spends most of his time in the Niflheim casino throughout the entire year.&nbsp;He is famous for using his title as a Demon Lord to torment the people.”</p><p>“So he’s like the neighborhood bully.”</p><p>I sneered.</p><p>Demon Lord Andromalius appeared in the game so I knew well about him.</p><p>If Dantalian was the practice boss, then he was the tutorial boss. He was a small-fry that pitifully gets killed by the level 1 hero.</p><p>Misery loved company.</p><p>Whether it was Andromalius or Dantalian, we&nbsp;were both on the level of being treated like a rice fish, so it would be a good idea if we were to support each other, but——</p><p>There was a severe difference between me and this wastrel.</p><p>Demon Lord Andromalius ‘awakens’ the hero.</p><p>In the prologue, the protagonist is assaulted by demons.</p><p>Except the protagonist, the townspeople and his entire family end up dying. If you chose to play as a male character, then your little sister. If you chose to play as a female character, then your big brother is sacrificed.</p><p>No matter what side, the protagonist loses someone important to him. Thus, burning with the desire for revenge, he vows ‘I will kill every last single Demon Lord on this continent.’……</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>The culprit that gives birth to the monster known as the hero.</p><p>That was the future that lied ahead for that man across the plaza who was abusing that old man.</p><p>The current year was 1505 on the Empire calendar. The year that the hero’s village gets attacked was 1506 on the Empire calendar.</p><p>It would only be appropriate to do all means before this year past. If not, then it meant that some kid in a mountain valley will suddenly awaken as a hero. Getting rid of the variable like hero early on would be a sensible decision if I wanted to continue living the remainder of my life peacefully and lazily.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>It was then.</p><p>With a ‘tirring’, an alarm rang and windows rose up.</p><p>The&nbsp;choices were&nbsp;as if they was bringing out my inner thoughts.</p><p>[1. Become friendly with Andromalius.]</p><p>[2. Murder Andromalius.]</p><p>I placed a hand on my chin.</p><p>…… Yes. The first choice was favorable.</p><p>After becoming friendly with Andromalius, I would induce him to more thoroughly attack the hero’s village. Eliminate the source of the problem. The tactic of getting rid of the dangerous sprout in advance was always valid.</p><p>On the other hand, the second choice was radical.</p><p>To kill Andromalius and thus ridding the cause of the problem entirely, the direction of that plan itself was not wrong. The problem was the ripple effect.</p><p>‘ A Demon Lord has murdered another Demon Lord.’</p><p>Due to such an incident, people would gather&nbsp;their attention onto me. People’s gazes would&nbsp;uselessly be focused on myself. As a solution, this caused too much commotion.</p><p>I preferred dealing with problems a bit more quietly. Such as assassination. That side was more to my preference. However, I didn’t even know where to hire an assassin…… Did I have to select number 1?</p><p>Looking at the cold atmosphere enveloping the plaza, I could tell that Andromalius had no popularity. The demon races here seemed to despise that lecher. It was a problem. If I were to get on friendly terms with Andromalius here, then my own image would fall as well. Reputation was like the life line of&nbsp;politicians. If possible, I wanted to keep that as clean as possible.</p><p>But, was any choice besides 1 attainable? To murder Andromalius and also avoid receiving attention. Could I make such an ideal result happen……? It was impossible to completely avoid the attention. But if I was able to shift the gaze to somewhere else……</p><p>“Your highness?”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli’s voice brought me out from my thoughts.</p><p>I swiftly turned my head.</p><p>“Lala. Do you still have the ring on you right now?”</p><p>“Yes?…… this one does have it on for now.”</p><p>“Let me confirm it real quick.”</p><p>Without any warning, I grabbed Lapis Lazuli’s left hand. I could feel a small bump over her white glove.</p><p>There was a ring on her annular finger.</p><p>Publicly, Lapis Lazuli was known as my concubine.</p><p>Demon Lord Dantalian had fallen for his half-breed lover so much, that he didn’t turn to political affairs. That kind of rumor. Of course, it was nothing more than a wild rumor that we had made on purpose.</p><p>The ring was bought in order to further flesh out that distorted rumor. A few days ago, I had&nbsp;spent&nbsp;1,600 gold to purchase two luxurious rings.</p><p>They were&nbsp;a pair of couple rings with a 5 carat azure&nbsp;colored diamond embed into each of them. There was writings on the back written in Frankish. ‘I do not desire anyone but you(AUTRE NE VUEIL).’</p><p>In other words, a typical engagement vow.</p><p>In the public eye, Demon Lord Dantalian was the world’s biggest fool.&nbsp;A simpleton who had bought a ring for his lover as soon as he had gained some money. But look at this now. It was good that I had prepared this beforehand. A use for the ring has already appeared. No matter when, an ounce of prevention was worth a pound of cure……</p><p>“Don’t think you’ll ever be able to do business in this neighborhood ever again, you old fart! You piece of moldy trash.”</p><p>Andromalius was still abusing that old man.</p><p>There was an evil smile on that guy’s face. It seemed he quite enjoyed beating people up. That naive complexion was enviable.</p><p>Regardless, playing by yourself will quickly get boring, Andromalius. Please do let me partake in your fun activities.</p><p>Do not worry. I have a knack for making drinking parties delightful. A mere moment ago, with my ornate eloquence, I was able to petrify the witches. You too, will soon be flailing on the floor&nbsp;convulsing with laughter. I shall make you into an amazing supporting character to a romance story.</p><p>Finally, I confirmed with Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>“Lazuli. Does Andromalius have a group that is protecting him?”</p><p>“As far as this one knows, there are&nbsp;none.”</p><p>“Is there another Demon Lord he is peculiarly friendly with?”</p><p>“There are none. Even amongst Demon Lords, Andromalius is treated as a disgraceful failure.”</p><p>“Splendid.”</p><p>In other words, I had nothing to worry about.</p><p>I raised my beer glass.</p><p>One. Two. Three.</p><p>After counting down in my mind, I dropped the glass—</p>"

Due to the silence, the sound of a glass shattering&nbsp;echoed loudly…… It was a mere single glass, but it was so loud that it could reach the furthest corners of the plaza.</p><p>“Aaang?”&nbsp;<em>(TL note: Not the last airbender)</em></p><p>Andromalius looked over here.</p><p>His slanted eyes resembled that of a fox and were detestable&nbsp;to look at.&nbsp;You could see his vulgar personality and foul&nbsp;temper&nbsp;just from his gaze.</p><p>“What are you supposed to be? You aren’t going to lower you eyes?”</p><p>Andromalius spoke towards his highness Dantalian.</p><p>His highness Dantalian was unresponsive. What was he thinking? I turned to carefully check on his highness’ complexion and— my spine became cold.</p><p>It was&nbsp;<strong>that face.</strong></p><p>The expression&nbsp;he made when he had discovered&nbsp;prey and was waiting&nbsp;for it with ease.</p><p>It wasn’t the face of a deadbeat which he normally&nbsp;had. A faint smile was drifting around the edges of his highness’ lips. It was the face he made when&nbsp;an ominous scheme, a wicked plot had formed in his head.</p><p>It seemed that the other party did not recognize his highness Dantalian. It was not weird. Since his highness’ horn was buried under his hair so it was barely visible.</p><p>Andromalius spit on the floor.</p><p>“Wow, look at that. He’s not&nbsp;lowering his eyes at all.”</p><p>After kicking the old dwarf one more time, he made his way towards us. The way he swayed looked like he was some wild cat that had found a new toy to play with.</p><p>The demon races who were sitting nearby cautiously backed away as he passed. They probably didn’t want to get caught up in the trouble.</p><p>On the other hand, the Berbere witches silently stayed in their seats. They had been hired by his highness Dantalian. Their pride wouldn’t allow them to do something like&nbsp;leaving his highness behind and running away.</p><p>“To see some peasants with no ethics.”</p><p>It seemed that he was displeased that the witches had not greeted him despite having seen him. Andromalius narrowed his brows.</p><p>“If you meet a Demon Lord then you should at least greet them with a bow, but what is this? Why are you being conceited with your chins held up?”</p><p>Andromalius&nbsp;strongly grabbed one of the witch’s hair. The witch let out a pained moan.</p><p>“Uuh……”</p><p>The witch’s name was Beatrice. I had heard that it had been a long time since she had participated in an escort trip, as she had concealed herself for several decades. Witches had itchy feet so it was common for them to go wandering for more than a hundred years. To end up getting involved with Andromalius&nbsp;subsequently to&nbsp;taking a request after a long period of time. That witch had terrible luck.</p><p>“Oii, slaves. A Demon Lord is here. It’s one of the&nbsp;honorable Demon Lords that gave you life and feeds you. You should be greeting me politely, and yet you’re not even budging from your seat.”</p><p>“Uh, uuh……”</p><p>You could hear the sound of some hair ripping.</p><p>Despite that, the witch kept her mouth shut.</p><p>It was a problem of etiquette. If the witches were to greet Andromalius here, then they would be admitting that Andromalius was a higher class than that of his&nbsp;highness Dantalian. It was vital for these witches to maintain their respect&nbsp;to his highness.</p><p>“Hoh. look at this.”</p><p>Andromalius smiled sadistically.</p><p>“The entire group of slaves have become mute. If your tongues are&nbsp;retarded then you should at least move your heads. Wow, all your necks are so stiff. Should this great one straighten them for you? Don’t refuse and……”</p><p>“What a garbage like man.”</p><p>It was then that his highness Dantalian had opened his mouth.</p><p>Andromalius flinched.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I said you were a garbage like man. I had thought it was only your brain that was&nbsp;rotten, but it seems your ears had festered as well.”</p><p>You could sense the shock of the people in the plaza through the air.</p><p>Even I had thought for a second that I had misheard. Garbage? It was a word that was not allowed to be said to a Demon Lord in a public place. Andromalius’ face quickly distorted.</p><p>“How dare you say such thoughtless words to this great one……”</p><p>“This is why delinquents with overinflated egos are pathetic. If you don’t have the money to pay for&nbsp;your drink, then apologize and leave. To find some fault and then proceed to beat up an elderly. It wasn’t enough that you had shamelessly&nbsp;advertised about your denseness in a loud voice, but&nbsp;you even went&nbsp;and picked on witches as well.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>His highness Dantalian laughed.</p><p>“And yet you still go around loudly calling yourself ‘great one’. This is quite the masterpiece. Andromalius. You are not a Demon Lord. You are nothing more than a rookie that was somehow born with a horn on their head.”</p><p>“Y-You bastard……?”</p><p>“The Gods truly are cruel. They made garbage like you into a Demon Lord in this world. Even saintesses would resent the Gods if they were to see your dirty mug. As days go by, it couldn’t be helped if&nbsp;the amount of devote believers were to go down……”</p><p>Andromalius’s complexion turned alternately pale and red.</p><p>If you looked carefully, then you could see that his shoulders were shaking. It was obvious. He had probably never&nbsp;received such severe insults in his entire life as a Demon Lord.</p><p>Andromalius shouted at the people around us.</p><p>“What are you all doing!? Why aren’t you taking this shameless man away immediately!?”</p><p>His highness Dantalian, as if he sincerely thought it was funny, snorted.</p><p>“See, is he&nbsp;not a masterpiece? He can’t even recognize a&nbsp;person of the same race right in front of him. Not only his ears, but his eyes must be festered as well, to the point that it&nbsp;wouldn’t be enough&nbsp;to treat him like a corpse.”</p><p>“Same race……?”</p><p>His highness shrugged.</p><p>“I am Rank 71st, Demon Lord Dantalian.&nbsp;Referentially, the witches that you had mistreated are the escorts I have hired for the day.”</p><p>“Rank 71st……”</p><p>“Do apologize for having mistreated my precious bodyguards as you pleased.”</p><p>His highness lowered his beer glass.&nbsp;<em>(TL note: I think he dropped someone else’s glass earlier)</em></p><p>“Do you understand?&nbsp;<strong>Sincerely</strong>&nbsp;apologize and leave. This may be difficult for the mentally challenged, but this is basic manners in society. Use this opportunity to learn.”</p><p>“Hah. And I was wondering what kind of incredible aristocrat you were supposed to be.”</p><p>Andromalius mocked triumphantly.</p><p>Despite the other person being his highness Dantalian, he was only higher by one rank. He was a small fry who didn’t have any remarkable talent and no reliable group behind his back. That was most likely what Andromalius&nbsp;was thinking.</p><p>That was foolish. There was nothing more idiotic&nbsp;than being careless while in front of his highness Dantalian.</p><p>His highness may normally be a severe deadbeat, but that was nothing more than a deceptive mask. His highness’ true self was actually a devilish fiend. He purposely lead the other party into being careless, and then consumed them in a single moment.</p><p>Andromalius most likely did not know any of this. There was still a mean smile&nbsp;on the edge of his lips. He was like a warthog charging straight towards&nbsp;the edge of a cliff.</p><p>“Is that so. Is it Dantalian. Iyaaah, I heard you were on a roll these days. There was a rumor spreading that some fool had made an outcast into his mistress. Yes. If you’re Dantalian…… then this must be that famous crossbreed.”</p><p><em>(TL note: Should I change outcast to untouchable?)</em></p><p>Andromalius now turned to look at me.</p><p>Did the target change from his highness to myself?</p><p>“The peasant that had fearlessly enticed a Demon Lord with their body! Sure enough. That&nbsp;hair of yours even resembles that vulgar bloodline of yours.”</p><p><em>Tap tap</em></p><p>Andromalius hit my cheek with his palm.</p><p>His hand stung fairly. He may had been tapping me playfully, but I could feel his real intentions.</p><p>“I really can’t understand your preference. Why would you want to score this kind of girl? Her appearance is decent, but the actually important bloodline is just foul.”</p><p>The act of changing his target to me was an okay decision.</p><p>Demon lords may have been sacred and inviolable, but they were not sacred to other Demon Lords. In other words, they were equal. If a Demon Lord were to hit another Demon Lord then troublesome common laws would intervene. On the other hand, it was okay to freely strike an outcast.</p><p>The reason why Andromalius had started to aim at me laid within here too. He had judged that it would be difficult to dominate with his rank alone, so he had quickly found another weak&nbsp;target.</p><p>“Or is it perhaps that? Your bottom mouth is&nbsp;just that impressive so you were able to captivate that Dantalian?”</p><p>Andromalius started snickering.</p><p>“I say. This great one is considering to give&nbsp;you my royal grace, but what do you think? For a person born as a peasant to be able to lay 2 Demon Lords.&nbsp;There’s isn’t an honor greater than this!”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Kuha! On one side is the rank 71st imbecile. And on the other side is the bitch born by some broad being raped by a lowly human. Is this not the masterpiece? Huh?”</p><p>Abruptly.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Andromalius slapped my cheek.</p><p>There was no playfulness in it this time. It purely contained the intent to be violent. My head ended up turning because of the excessively strong hit.</p><p>—That hurt quite a lot.</p><p>However, it was trivial.</p><p>Since a young age, I had been exposed to violence so many&nbsp;times&nbsp;that I had become dulled to it. There was a time I had stones tossed at me by the village people on a daily basis. Compared to that, Andromalius’ hit was like that of a child.</p><p>People may not be able to get accustomed to pain, but people can get accustomed to bearing the pain. That is what people are. And I am&nbsp;one of those people.</p><p>“……”</p><p>I returned my gaze forward.</p><p>As soon as I did so, the laughter in Andromalius’ voice stopped.</p><p>“Aaang? The hell are you looking at?”</p><p>Andromalius slapped me once more. It felt like he had put all of his weight into his hand that time. Unfortunately, at this point, it was proven that Andromalius did not spend his time exercising. His hit wasn’t heavy at all.</p><p>I looked forward again.</p><p>“……Both master and servant are annoying!”</p><p>Andromalius bellowed out.</p><p>He swung his arm over and over again. And each time my head was moved by the force. But it was useless. Since it’d returned back to its original position.</p><p>“Gr, grrrr……!”</p><p>Seeing that, Andromalius’ face slowly started to collapse into rage. To not be able to contain his childish rage, how low. It was at the point where I couldn’t bear to watch him.</p><p>I wonder if his highness Dantalian had thought&nbsp;the same thing, he had been chuckling besides me.</p><p>“What a sight this is, Andromalius. To be an honorable Demon Lord and yet&nbsp;be unable to make a single outcast submit to you. This is unheard of. Are you sure it wasn’t a mistake by the Gods that you had become a Demon Lord? Originally, were you not supposed to be born as a peasant?”</p><p>Andromalius’ face became red hot.</p><p>“T-This great one…… this great one……!”</p><p>“It’s okay. You do not have to make excuses. Even Gods have times where they doze off while working.”</p><p>His highness Dantalian smiled.</p><p>“However, this shall be the last time that I warn you. Do not lay your hand on my beloved&nbsp;again. And sincerely apologize for beating my escorts and my lover.”</p><p>“Don’t make me laugh!”</p><p><em>Smack</em></p><p>Andromalius, with his fist, hit me with all his strength. I fell back from my chair and rolled onto the floor. The witches let out a scream.</p><p>“……”</p><p>My mouth was tingling from the impact. With my tongue, I could taste&nbsp;something like iron in my mouth. I took out a napkin and wiped the corners of my mouth. The napkin became red with blood.</p><p>I raised my body slowly.</p><p>“The death penalty for you!”</p><p>Andromalius was waving his finger at me.</p><p>There was hatred in his eyes. Was it not surprising? How someone could despise another person so much after having only just met them. They were setting their emotions at an&nbsp;<strong>unimaginably&nbsp;low price</strong>.</p><p>Unfortunately, as a merchant, I could not respect the half-wit who was trying to sell their product for dirt cheap.</p><p>“The death penalty! You’ll receive capital punishment! Something like an outcast, we can give you a summary conviction without even having a trial……! Even if you were to die by this great one’s hands, you can’t resist! Do you know that!? Apologize for acting so impudently&nbsp;before this great one!”</p><p>Death sentence, death sentence. He was noisy.</p><p>To only be able to spout the same word over and over again. That showed the man’s level of intelligence. A 5-year-old goblin would probably display a more diverse vocabulary. I, with the same expressionless face, stared back at Andromalius.</p><p>“This bitch, till the very end!”</p><p>Andromalius made his way towards me.</p><p>“Fine! I’ll tear&nbsp;your mouth right now, bitch! Go to hell and repent on—iiii, guaaaaaak!?”</p><p>However, he was not able to even take 5 steps.</p><p>All the people in the plaza let out a scream at once. Andromalius had fallen to the floor. From his neck, dark red blood poured out.</p><p>“Uh, uuah? Aaaaack!?”</p><p>Andromalius instinctively moved his hands to block the wound.</p><p>The blood volume was serious. It wasn’t some cute scratch that you could just cover with the palm of your hand and stop it. Andromalius, looking at the amount of blood on his hand, let out a cry.</p><p>It was a single blow aimed at a vital point.</p><p>In order to give certain death in one strike.</p><p>Seeing that, I thought that it really—.</p><p>Really befitted his highness Dantalian’s hunting method.</p><p>“How regrettable.”</p><p>His highness Dantalian wiped the blood off of his dagger.</p><p>“To treat my warning as a trifling matter.”</p><p>His highness Dantalian’s carefreeness was boundless. Out of the hundreds of people in the entire plaza, his highness was the only one who was relaxed. As if he was far away from the buzzing atmosphere around us.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>‘Did this person really just stab Andromalius?’</p><p>To the point that people&nbsp;would inadvertently doubt themselves and think that.</p><p>Regardless, his highness was holding a blade in his hand which was dripping with blood. The dripping blood adamantly rid people of any doubt.</p><p>I wonder if it was because the person who had caused the incident was so relaxed. The plaza that was buzzing with noise a second ago, had started to quiet down. A suffocating silence fell over the plaza. In that silent air, his highness Dantalian’s voice echoed lowly.</p><p>“Lapis Lazuli.”</p><p>“Yes, your highness.”</p><p>I immediately bowed my head.</p><p>“Recite the&nbsp;occasion a Demon Lord is allowed to attack another Demon Lord.”</p><p>“As this one is ordered to. For a Demon Lord to do harm to another Demon lord, one must first respectfully warn the other party twice. When the other party clearly ignores the warning, and proceeds to severely damage the honor of the first Demon Lord, then that Demon Lord may attack the other.</p><p>A common law.</p><p>Because Demon Lords&nbsp;were&nbsp;sacred, they were free from earthly laws. However, if conflict were to occur between Demon Lords, then they had to be confined to the common laws. The common law that I had just recited was known as the&nbsp;「Coctyus Warning」.</p><p>According to legends, if a person were to die then they had to cross over 5 rivers. Acheron, Coctyus, Phlegethon, Lethe, and Styx…… Coctyus was the second river. If a deceased were to cross over the Coctyus river, they would eventually reach Phlegethon, where instead of water it was&nbsp;a river of lava. Here people would fall into the river&nbsp;and&nbsp;have their souls lit aflame. That was why,&nbsp;when giving the Coctyus Warning, it meant that you were telling the other party to back off before they&nbsp;got burned.</p><p>Andromalius groaned.</p><p>“C-Coctyus Warning……? Keuhk! You bastard, do you even know what nonsense you’re saying!?”</p><p>That kind of response was natural.</p><p>Normally, Coctyus Warning was only used&nbsp;in the events of a war. If a Demon Lord wanted to attack another Demon Lord’s base, then they had to send a declaration of war twice. The warning was used in this kind of situation.</p><p>It’s original purpose was to prevent war. By declaring that sudden attacks without having sent a declaration of war beforehand was illegal, in conclusion, had the effect of restraining conflict. His highness Dantalian was cleverly abusing this common law.</p><p>Andromalius howled.</p><p>“Keuk, it’s the end for you bastard! Dantalian! The end…… The other Demon Lords won’t let this slide easily…… keub! It’s too late to cry and beg for forgiveness! This great one will never forgive you!”</p><p>“The one at their end is you.”</p><p>His highness Dantalian stepped on the back of Andromalius’ hand. The sound of bones breaking echoed. Andromalius cried out&nbsp;even more sorrowfully and flailed on the floor.</p><p>“Rank 72nd Demon Lord. The crimes you have committed are as followed. First, you had mocked and beat&nbsp;the escorts I had hired without any reason. Second, you had irrationally assaulted my lover.”</p><p>His highness Dantalian looked around and spoke in a loud voice.</p><p>“I had respectfully requested for Andromalius to stop, but he had ignored me. He had not only threatened my safety, but he had harmed&nbsp;my honor as well. Everyone here is&nbsp;a&nbsp;witness!”</p><p>The people in the plaza started to mumble amongst one another.</p><p>Andromalius was most likely no longer in his highness’ thought anymore. His highness Dantalian was aiming to drag these people here in as witnesses.</p><p>“Look here!”</p><p>Taking off his gloves and throwing them aside, he grabbed my left hand as well, followed by taking off the glove that was on that hand. And as if to show the world, his highness raised my left hand high.</p><p>The ring on my annular finger.</p><p>A blue diamond shone brightly and sparkled.</p><p>A similar ring&nbsp;was on his highness’&nbsp;annular finger as well.</p><p>“I am a Demon Lord. This youngster is a peasant.&nbsp;Us two are not permitted to be wedded. However, swearing to the Goddess Aphrodite, I, Dantalian, the rank 71st Demon Lord declare&nbsp;my love for this girl! This ring is proof of that! Even if society were to forbid our marriage, our hearts are already connected!”</p><p>The people let out a gasp.</p><p>A Demon Lord had confessed his love for a peasant. In a public plaza and in front an&nbsp;audience of hundreds of people, at that.</p><p>From tomorrow on, the high societies were going to be&nbsp;flipped over. The gossip of the passionate love between a Demon Lord and an outcast will be talked about everywhere. It was a natural phenomenon. Regardless of the generation, people were bound to get excited by the topic of ‘forbidden love’.</p><p>That was where his highness’ deception laid.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>In this grand love story,&nbsp;the character known as Andromalius&nbsp;fell&nbsp;into being a mere supporting role.</p><p>A crafty trick.</p><p>If his highness Dantalian were to simply murder Andromalius, what would have happened? Inevitably, it would become nothing more than a murder case.</p><p>But if&nbsp;he were to commit murder for ‘the peasant he loved’, then the story was different. The monotonous murder play would change into a forbidden love performance.</p><p>His highness and myself were Romeo and Juliet.</p><p>Andromalius was the supporting character, Tybalt, who gets murdered&nbsp;by Romeo.</p><p>The truth was easily distorted.</p><p>“T-To fall in love with an outcast. What madness. Insane…… A disgrace of a Demon Lord!”</p><p>Andromalius let out a pained groan.</p><p>That poor man had no idea. He was going to face his end without knowing what kind of scheme he was being swept up in. I felt a touch of sympathy for him.</p><p>“You bastard. You don’t deserve the right to be called the same race as this great one. Hierarchy is a sacred order. For you to dare go against the order of nature……!”</p><p>“I wonder. Order of nature is it?”</p><p>His highness lowered his gaze towards Andromalius.</p><div></div><p>A quiet, but horrifying whisper flowed from his highness’ lips.</p><p>“Let me tell you what the true order of nature is. Rookie. It’s the law of the jungle. If a cat were to go against&nbsp;a tiger, then the only result would be death. The truth of the world is quiet the simple and boring thing. Don’t you think?”</p><p>It was then that Andromalius’ complexion turned pale.</p><p>He had probably now barely realized that his highness Dantalian was truly going to kill him.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>“That is why I personally prefer lies over truth. Like how a bare face would require make-up, it is essential&nbsp;for life to have some spice.”</p><p>“S-Spare……”</p><p>“Wrong choice.”</p><p>Without inquiring into the right or wrong, his highness swung his dagger.</p><p>The blade stabbed into Andromalius’ throat just like that.</p><p>Blood flooding into Andromalius’ windpipe forced him to vomit blood.</p><p>“Gua, &nbsp;guuhaaak……”</p><p>“<strong>Spare me?&nbsp;</strong>That is a terribly boring line. In our already boring lives, that only further tortures us&nbsp;in agony. I see&nbsp;boredom as&nbsp;the sin of humanity, and find it similar to that of a harmful insect that deserves to be exterminated.”</p><p>His highness whispered.</p><p>It was in such a low volume that only I, who was sitting right besides him, could hear it.</p><p>“Next time, come back after practicing better dying words, you third-rate actor.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Andromalius shuddered.</p><p>Like a doll who had its&nbsp;strings cut, his head fell limp.</p><p>Was the last emotion that flashed in his eyes fear, or was it hatred for his highness Dantalian. I thought both options were very much possible.</p><p>His highness straightened his back and glanced around the plaza. No one tried to make eye contact with his highness. They were all instinctively trying to avoid his highness’ eyes. Everyone had been consumed by his highness Dantalian’s composed atmosphere.</p><p>It was amazing. His highness Dantalian was single-handedly overwhelming this large plaza.</p><p>Until now, I had thought that a king’s grandeur was nothing more than an abstract concept. However, after looking at his highness, I understood. His highness had something that could overwhelm the audience.</p><p>He&nbsp;was not dominating the citizens with fear. He was not attracting people with prestige. Something much different was lurking……</p><p>Why he didn’t show off this ability in the past. How he was enlightened with a tremendous amount of talent after overcoming a life or death situation with the adventurers. The current me could not answer any of this.</p><p>However.</p><p>“You held on well, Lala.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“My vassal should&nbsp;never&nbsp;thoughtlessly submit to another individual. When you refused to turn your gaze till the very end,&nbsp;despite being hit by Andromalius, I was quite impressed. You are a brilliant woman.”</p><p>His highness laughed slyly.</p><p>Hearing that light laughter, I thought.</p><p>In the end, it was not the wrong choice to serve under his highness.</p><p>For the first time today, I was certain.</p><h4>▯Keuncuska Executive, Miser Goblin, Torukel</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 8, Day&nbsp;16</p><p>Keuncuska Firm Headquarters, Highest floor</p><p>The highest floor of the headquarters.</p><p>It was a place where only a small handful of executives had access to.</p><p>No one else was here in this large room. Only a bunch of coffins were spread out across the room…… At glance, the amount was over thirty.</p><p>“Keruk.”</p><p>No matter how many times I saw this, it gave me a guilty conscience(?)<em>(TL note: 께름칙하다 not sure how to translate this)</em>. Vampires nowadays claimed that coffins were too old-school and did not use them anymore. They all properly slept on beds. Yet again, I realized that Ivar Lodbrok was an old chap who had fallen behind on the times.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>It was at the time I had turned my head to read a&nbsp;book.</p><p>“—Mr. Torukel.”</p><p>“Oh God!”</p><p>I jumped in surprise and turned around.</p><p>A short witch was smiling back wickedly.</p><p>“You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”</p><p>“If you’re here then say so!”</p><p>“I’m sorry. I couldn’t help but want&nbsp;to tease you&nbsp;the moment&nbsp;I saw you, Mr. Torukel.”</p><p>“Keruruk, I felt like my heart would drop…… but what’s with that weird way of speech?”</p><p>The witch walked in strides towards a black coffin.</p><p>If I recalled correctly her name was Beatrice. She was originally a witch that was part of the Berbere Sisters. Several decades ago, after conflicting with Ivar Lodbrok, she was captured by this side. Yesterday, they went out saying that they were going to dig up information on Lapis Lazuli. In other words, act as a spy.</p><p>“My way of speech?”</p><p>The witch sat on top of the coffin. Her voice may have been coy but her face was all smiles. That pervert. They were&nbsp;most definitely enjoying this situation.</p><p>“What about my speech, Mr. Torukel the Miser?”</p><p>“It’s disturbing enough that I feel like my stomach is twisting…… jeez. There’s no point in nagging since you won’t listen anyways. Whatever. Tell me about Lapis Lazuli’s movements. You’re back since you were able to gain new information, are you not?”</p><p>“Please do not be in such a rush, Mr. Torukel. Men who push women are not popular. Since you’re always like that, that’s why you haven’t had a wife for over a hundred years, .”</p><p>“I am voluntarily single!”</p><p>The witch burst out in laughter.</p><p>Even her laugh was witch-like. This is making me go mad.</p><p>“I wonder. There is one important thing I found out. Demon Lord Dantalian had fallen deeper in love with the&nbsp;succubus than we had originally thought. He even brazenly confessed his love for the girl in the middle of Hermes’ Plaza.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Should I recite what he said word by&nbsp;word? ‘I am a Demon Lord. This youngster is a peasant.&nbsp;Us two are not permitted to be wedded. However, swearing to the Goddess Aphrodite, I, Dantalian, the rank 71st Demon Lord declare&nbsp;my love for this girl.’”</p><p>I creased my brows.</p><p>To say those kind of lines in a public space, that didn’t make any sense. There was a limit to how foolish a person could be. Even if Dantalian was a dullard who didn’t know shame, would he really do such a thing?</p><p>“It’s true. He even killed Andromalius&nbsp;claiming it was for the succubus.”</p><p>“Andromalius? Don’t tell me you’re talking about the rank 72nd Demon Lord.”</p><p>The witch made a bitter smile.</p><p>The fellow told me everything. About how Andromalius was causing a ruckus. How he had insulted&nbsp;the witches and assaulted Lapis Lazuli. And how Dantalian murdered Andromalius……</p><p>“Dear god.”</p><p>As I listened to the story, my mouth opened wider and wider.</p><p>The witch, as if she had understood my feelings, nodded.</p><p>“The streets of Niflheim are full of clamor. No matter where you go, people are talking about the love story between Demon Lord Dantalian and the peasant Lapis Lazuli. People are just falling at the feet of forbidden love.”</p><p>“This doesn’t make sense. Even if Andromalius was the worst Demon Lord, he was still a Demon Lord by name. It’s not possible to just kill him like that!”</p><p>“Regrettably, the public of Niflheim are favoring Dantalian.”</p><p>The witch spoke flatly.</p><p>“Andromalius spent his time passing through the casinos behaving like a vandal, you already know this. If you excluded his standing, then there was nothing good about him. Obviously, his reputation was the worst. The majority of the citizens are saying that they’re delighted and are even toasting over it.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>It wasn’t hard to imagine.</p><p>Complaints about Andromalius’ despicable antics would come regularly. Even if he’s a Demon Lord isn’t this too severe, does he not need to be restrained, these kind of talk would go over the city council from time to time. To sum it up, he was a headache for everyone.</p><p>There was also a fair amount of people who had died from&nbsp;being irrationally beaten by Andromalius. The family of the deceased were most likely praising Dantalian.</p><p>“……The timing is too good.</p><p>“Yup—”</p><p>The witch nodded her chin.</p><p>Soon a large meeting for Demon Lords was going to be held. We were planning to attack Dantalian politically there. During the little remaining period of time before the conference, which was now, Dantalian was abruptly able to gain popularity with the people.</p><p>“Is this truly a coincidence?”</p><p>It was difficult to erase the doubt in my head. We couldn’t be certain that getting rid of Andromalius wasn’t planned. I gave a doubt filled gaze towards the witch.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“I wasn’t able to research that far in. However……”</p><p>“However, the chances are high. Is what you’re saying.”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>The witch’s face became serious.</p><p>“Dantalian, as soon as Andromalius attacked his lover, used the Cocytus Warning as a pretext. As if he was waiting for it. This is an idea that’s difficult to think of on the spot.”</p><p>“Kuuuh.”</p><p>Then this wasn’t a murder by chance.</p><p>Everyone&nbsp;knew that Andromalius wandered&nbsp;here and there in Niflheim. The places he went to were also limited. The casino, the red-light district, and the bar. These were it. The chances of coming across Andromalius was&nbsp;fairly high. Planning to murder him was not that hard either……</p><p>“Don’t you think it’s funny?”</p><p>“Keruk? What?”</p><p>“For the past several years, no one had tried to stop Andromalius from making a disturbance. Only because he was a Demon Lord. Despite that, Dantalian had killed that troublemaker within 30 minutes of meeting him……”</p><p>The witch smiled wryly.</p><p>“Andromalius grabbed my hair&nbsp;and&nbsp;pulled it as he pleased. It made me feel like I was some livestock instead of a person. Like a pig you could beat and play around with&nbsp;as you pleased.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“It was incredibly insulting.”</p><p>The witch’s pupil shined peculiarly.</p><p>This fellow clearly harbored hostility against the existence known as Demon Lords.</p><p>“He only had a higher status. When that incompetent man with no talent whatsoever pulled at my hair, it felt so unpleasant that I wanted to rip his throat out and……”</p><p>“Hey. I’m not disagreeing with your opinion at all, but.”</p><p>I spoke carefully.</p><p>“Speaking in a logical point of view, Demon Lords&nbsp;aren’t completely talentless. For starters, they’ve mastered the language of Babylon. And are they not able to understand and use every demon language since birth? Furthermore, their political symbolism……”</p><p>“I have command over 36 languages of different races.”</p><p>“…… I am knowledgeable of this. Anyways, Demon Lords have a religious mystique. To the majority, Demon Lords are the agents of Gods and they are also the greatest of priests.”</p><p>“So if someone were to order for a Demon Lord to die, then the&nbsp;one to have ordered the&nbsp;task would die instead?”</p><p>The witch laughed mockingly.</p><p>“Oh please. Mr. Torukel. Do not think while in the perspective of the people.”</p><p>The witch’s tone became solemn and a profound smile formed on her lips.</p><p>“The public are nothing more than a group of idiotic and unimaginative people.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, but I have to object against that. A group is superior to an individual. Even a hero can’t conquer the continent on their own.”</p><p>“So are you saying that we should follow the majority logic and use that to determine what’s right and wrong? Torukel. Our aristocrat miser goblin. That is not a very good tactic in our current situation.”</p><p><em>Taack.</em></p><p>The fellow had snapped their finger.</p><p>And immediately after, the sound of a coffin opening up somewhere in the room echoed. With a dreary atmosphere, someone raised their upper body from the black coffin.</p><p>It was a girl wearing a servant outfit.</p><p>She slowly opened her eyes and looked this way.</p><p>The girl smiled coldly and moved her lips.</p><p>“Because we are larger in number.”</p><p>“……An individual’s opinion can be respected even in a society where majority logic&nbsp;is in common use. It is possible as long as one has even the smallest of refinement and consideration.”</p><p>“Oh, do you really think so?”</p><p>The servant lightly tapped the back of her&nbsp;hand. Promptly, another black coffin opened up and&nbsp;figure rose.</p><p>This time it was a man with the head of a wolf. It was a werewolf.&nbsp;The man growled deeply.</p><p>“That is possible when the minority has a decent amount of strength. However, in the demon world which we live in, there are at least over 470 orc tribes while there are only 2 remaining werewolf tribes. If disharmony were to happen between the two races, do you think that the millions of orcs would show consideration to the merely hundreds of werewolves? One could only plead for&nbsp;the orcs to have a decent amount of&nbsp;<strong>refinement and consideration</strong>.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>The werewolf whistled.</p><p>As soon as he did so, all the remaining coffins opened up at the same time.</p><p>Each coffin had one person. A total of 33 personage raised their bodies.</p><p>Among them, an old gentlemen approached this way.</p><p>“The minority requires strength, Torukel. Especially someone like me, who is in a race with only two other vampires remaining, I have to be more cautious of my surroundings.”</p><p>“…… Ivar Lodbrok.”</p><p>A sigh came from my mouth.</p><p>That was his power as a true vampire and a puppeteer.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The ability to move his conscience to his slaves whenever he pleased.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok had 32 slave dolls. Hence, it was possible for him to do 32 different tasks whenever he wanted. It was a closely guarded secret that only I, among the executives, knew of.</p><p>The demon world was currently in control by the Demon Lords. No matter how rich you were, there was always the danger of being purged by the true people in power. That was why a person would have&nbsp;to set up safety precautions. That was what Ivar Lodbrok’s 32 slave dolls were.</p><p>Even if a Demon Lord were to threaten us, Ivar Lodbrok could move his conscience around his slaves and stay alive till the very end. That was why Ivar Lodbrok hid these dolls in absolute secrecy. A secret that Demon Lords must not know.</p><p>……Although, seeing the way he behaved, it felt like half the reason he did it was because it was a&nbsp;hobby.</p><p>“Hm. Everything seems to be fine.”</p><p>Ivar, with a satisfied air around him, patted the dust off of his body.</p><p>“I was worried that a problem might occur because&nbsp;it had been a long time since I had moved my conscience around. I couldn’t be more refreshed.”</p><p>“That is a relief. After I was forced to witness an old man act like a young girl, my eye sockets and earholes ended up rotting. I mean, why are you so adept at copying how&nbsp;<strong>a little girl talks</strong>?”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok&nbsp;raised his shoulders.</p><p>“What am I supposed to do when the conscience is affected by the body?”</p><p>Ivar shrugged.</p><p>“I request for&nbsp;you to understand, Torukel. In order to deceive the Berbere Sisters, acting is essential. They still do not know that Beatrice was taken by me.”</p><p>“Okay, that’s fine for the witches. But why did you have to behave like a girl and add honorifics while in&nbsp;front of me?”</p><p>“Of course,&nbsp;to enjoy watching your facial expression rot whenever I used honorifics.”</p><p>“Then it was your hobby!”</p><p>Ivar let out a laugh.</p><p>After laughing for a period of time, he became serious.</p><p>“…… Torukel. Think carefully. Even if they were to kill Andromalius, Demon Lord Dantalian gets no profit.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“For a short, short period of time he will receive popularity from the citizens. But&nbsp;if you looked at it long-term, then the loss is going to be tremendous. The fact that he had taken an outcast as a lover will remain as a smudge and continue to dirty his reputation. In conclusion, his political life will be shortened. He will be choking his own neck.”</p><p>I creased my brows.</p><p>“Then why did Dantalian kill Andromalius?”</p><p>Ivar shook his head side to side.</p><p>“Think bigger, Torukel.”</p><p>“Bigger?”</p><p>“In this incident, there is one person who would get an absolute gain. It is not Andromalius. It is not Dantalian either.”</p><p>“……?”</p><p>It was a puzzle like statement.</p><p>Andromalius and Dantalian had clashed. Both sides did not gain any profit. Who here could…… aah. Was that it, was that what it was!</p><p>“Lapis Lazuli!”</p><p>My voice became louder on its own.</p><p>“Thanks to this affair, this&nbsp;was no different from Lapis Lazuli being officially accepted as the lover of a Demon Lord!”</p><p>“That is so. That succubus girl is the only one to take any gains.”</p><p>Ivar nodded.</p><p>“That girl had probably instructed&nbsp;Dantalian beforehand, that if Andromalius was to try and&nbsp;start a quarrel with them, then to use the Coctyus Warning as a pretext then&nbsp;murder him. Since Dantalian had fallen so deeply for that succubus, he would have more than gladly complied. And as they had planned, they encountered Andromalius……”</p><p>I couldn’t believe it.</p><p>“Then, Lapis Lazuli did all that purely to only increase her own status……?”</p><p>“Indeed. She had played with two Demon Lords. Dantalian, of course, and Andromalius had probably unknowingly got swept away in her plot.”</p><p>“What a ludicrous woman……”</p><p>I could feel my own voice trembling.</p><p>In contrast, Ivar muttered as if he was having fun.</p><p>“Is it not magnificent? A short time ago, that succubus was nothing more than a merchant. However, she was able to obtain a large loan from our firm by fooling us, she was able to put&nbsp;Dantalian on her side, and now she was able to get rid of Andromalius……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“I am genuinely touched. This succubus is like the embodiment of lust for power. For such a girl to have been born, this world is truly worth living.”</p><p>Ivar looked straight at me.</p><p>“Torukel. Our opponent is formidable. That succubus girl is&nbsp;competent enough to overcome her own wall of social status. She is cold-hearted and merciless.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“But she has yet to past being anything more than a frail schemer. Lapis Lazuli’s position comes from Dantalian. If we purge Dantalian, then she would no&nbsp;longer be the lover of a Demon Lord or anything else. She would only be an arrogant outcast.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>That was an accurate call.</p><p>If you wanted to go for an&nbsp;admiral, then shoot the horse first.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli was currently on the horse known as Dantalian and was rushing forward with spirit. If you tied&nbsp;down Dantalian’s feet, then naturally her spirit will be cut as well.</p><p>“With no mistake. You have to tear them apart…… can you do this?”</p><p>“It’s okay to have my vow. Her highness Paimon has also completely agreed&nbsp;with&nbsp;our plan. If a one to ten thousand situation was to occur, then I will take all the responsibility.”</p><p>I stared back at Ivar Lodbrok seriously.</p><p>Once I did so, Ivar Lodbrok nodded.</p><p>Without asking who was going to start first, we recited the vow pledge.</p><p>“Oh great Keuncuska—”</p><p>“You shall repay blood with blood.”</p><p>This was a saying of our firm that boasted 400 years of history. In other words, we were shouldering 400 years of pride on this large meeting. Losing was unpardonable.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli. You may be an impressive heroine, but you are still a young sprout. We shall step on you thoroughly.</p><hr><p>TL note: Chapter 4 is complete! It was shorter than the other chapters. And oh dear God, I think Chapter 5 is the longest chapter. Not by a lot, but it’s still the longest.</p><p>Honestly, translating parts that aren’t a pov of Dantalian or Lala is pretty tiring. I just get less enthusiastic about it. So the Torukel POV part took a bit longer than what I anticipated.</p><p>Also, once again, I’d like to mention that our Discord group for Dungeon Defense is very much active. Drop by and chat with everyone here. It’s great being able to get immediate feedback from you guys over there while I’m translating. So like, go join it, or something.</p><p>Oh, I might slow a SMALL bit down in translations. My brain feels like it’s going numb from all this non-stop translations and I haven’t been really able to properly enjoy myself.</p>"

Without pause, refined ladies and gentlemen&nbsp;got off their carriages. Their appearances and&nbsp;outfits all varied in style but there was one thing that they all had in common; they all had horns.</p><p>I was seated in a&nbsp;carriage and vacantly staring out the window.</p><p>“It doesn’t seem like a lot of Demon Lords are coming.”</p><p>“The attendance of the Walpurgis Night is not enforced. Demon Lords with the tendency of being single-minded will most likely not participate. Rank 1st Demon Lord Baal and rank 2nd Demon Lord Agares will not attend.”</p><p>“Then why do I have to attend? So troublesome.”</p><p>“This meeting is being held in order to discuss the countermeasures for the plague. It would be difficult for your highness, who has a monopoly over the cure, to not participate.”</p><p>“So it’s a problem of people being too distinguished.”</p><p>A moment later, Lapis Lazuli muttered&nbsp;furtively in a low voice.</p><p>“…… Your highness. As expected, this one shouldn’t go in together with your highness.”</p><p>“Are you still saying that?”</p><p>I grumbled.</p><p>“You are publicly my fiance. If not my fiance, then what other woman am I supposed to take to this ball?”</p><p>In this gathering, before going fully into the meeting, a type of entertainment was scheduled for the guests to enjoy. The scheduled entertainment was this ball.</p><p>I had chosen Lapis Lazuli as my partner for the ball. It was an obvious choice. However, it seemed that our Miss Lala was feeling very burdened by the ball.</p><p>“Walpurgis Night is a social party strictly reserved for Demon Lords. Only lords of the highest standings would be allowed to attend. It is not a place where a mixed blood, like this one, should be present.”</p><p>“Nevertheless, there are&nbsp;no rules that the companion has to be a Demon Lord as well. It is fine to bring anyone I please.”</p><p>“There may be no rule, but it is customary that……”</p><p>“Aah, I can’t hear you—I can’t hear you—.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli shut her mouth.</p><p>Even if you glared at me with those eyes of dissatisfaction, it couldn’t be helped.</p><p>Dantalian was currently receiving the spotlight as the main character in a romance story. A man blinded by love. That was my image to the people. It was impossible to leave Lapis Lazuli and wander on my own at this point.</p><p>Furthermore, I had taken a liking to this concept. A fool who had indulged in his passion and had lost all of his rationality. Was this not appropriate? No one would be&nbsp;cautious around a fool like that.</p><p>Smart people would only scorn a dullard like me and do nothing more. Followed by coming to a misunderstanding&nbsp;that the true culprit was Lapis Lazuli. All suspicion would&nbsp;focus on Lapis Lazuli, while I was rejoicing my days of freedom……</p><p>Am I, perhaps, a genius?</p><p>It was truly the perfect plan.</p><p>Thanks to the Black Death I had made an incredible amount of money, and now, the only thing I had left to do was to shut myself in my castle and live the rest of my life as a shut-in. The gate to Heaven was already right in front of me.</p><p>“…… Your highness is making the same face&nbsp;your highness makes&nbsp;when thinking of something perverted.”</p><p>Be quiet.</p><p>After 20 minutes had passed, the main gate became more vacant. It was then that we had departed from our carriage and entered the ballroom. We had waited until now because we did not want to deal with being harassed by other people.</p><p>The gatekeeper, noticing our approach, announced&nbsp;in a loud voice.</p><p>“Rank 71st, Demon Lord Dantalian, entering!”</p><p>All at once, the people in the inner-venue turned&nbsp;to look this way.</p><p>Not being bothered by their gazes, I made my way to a corner of the ballroom and took my place there.&nbsp;The sound of people whispering around us&nbsp;could be heard. I was&nbsp;not&nbsp;able to hear what they were saying exactly, but I knew it was not a favorable mood. It was close to the feeling of them being aghast&nbsp;by the fact that I had arrived at&nbsp;the ball actually accompanied by an outcast as a partner.</p><p>I muttered.</p><p>“It feels like I’ve become a celebrity.”</p><p>“This one thinks that we do not have to go as far as to link arms.”</p><p>“Is it not fine since we adequately appear like fools?”</p><p>Referentially, we were affectionately standing&nbsp;arm in arm.</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>“Don’t loathe something like just linking arms. I am also planning to kiss your lips in a bit, after all.”</p><p>“Your highness Dantalian’s tongue will be cut off then.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“I especially like the unfriendly way you respond.”</p><p>“Of course, your highness.”</p><p>“Oh, Lazuli. Do not live so selfishly. We are currently the couple throwing around&nbsp;the hottest scandal on the continent. The people are demanding a spectacle from us. Can you not&nbsp;touch lips with the meaning of&nbsp;being a service to the people? Demonstrate some sacrifice mentality for once.”</p><p>“In the continent which this one knows of, for the most selfish person to give this one such an advice. It is incredibly&nbsp;shocking……”</p><p>“I am curious so I must ask. Do you know that each and every time you speak coldly, your lips shine&nbsp;temptingly that much as well?&nbsp;If by chance, with that intention, you were trying to charm me then……”</p><p><em>Step</em></p><p>Lapis Lazuli was stepping on my toes.</p><p>“What an adorable response. I’m starting to like you more.”</p><p>“What a coincidence. This one is starting to detest your highness more.”</p><p>“One day we will discover a common ground.”</p><p>“Please keep in mind that that common ground will never be on top of a bed.”</p><p>“What a deplorable front.”</p><p>I decided to back off for now. There really wasn’t anything more enjoyable in the world than teasing a competent woman.</p><p>Fairies, holding trays filled with alcoholic beverages, came fluttering&nbsp;towards us. I lightly picked up a glass of white wine. Lapis Lazuli and I, on good terms(I admit that I am using words that are debatable), enjoyed our&nbsp;wine and waited for the ball to begin.</p><p>Other than the fairies, no one else had tried to approach us. People only examined us from afar out of the corner of their eyes. It felt like I had become a hippo in a zoo for sightseeing purposes.</p><p>Despite that, I was able to spend my time amusingly. It was quite interesting to be able to actually see how the Demon Lords looked like in real life, when originally, I had only seen them as&nbsp;illustrations in &lt;Dungeon Attack&gt;. Rank 9th Paimon, rank 8th Barbatos, rank 5th Marbas…… Was this the level of the highest Demon Lords? They were powerful enemies that had given Game Overs to my game protagonist multiple times.</p><p>“I would like to raise a greeting to all of the lords who&nbsp;were able to gather here for today’s Walpurgis Night. My&nbsp;name is Ivar Lodbrok and I am from the Keuncuska Firm. Excessively, I&nbsp;have been bestowed the honor to host today’s meeting.”</p><p>An incredibly old gentlemen walked to the center of the ballroom. A small applaud came from the Demon Lords. It felt as if only about 6 people had clapped their hands. The rest of the Demon Lords merely gazed at the old man apathetically.</p><p>On the other hand, I narrowed my brows.</p><p>“That’s Ivar Lodbrok?”</p><p>“Yes. That man is the wealthiest person in the demon world, the owner of Keuncuska Firm, and a true vampire, Ivar Lodbrok. The person that this one had betrayed thanks to your highness.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>A male, huh.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok was a character that appeared in the game as well. Except, the Ivar Lodbrok that I knew of was a bit different from the one in front of me.</p><p>I waited to see what would happen in the ballroom with an interested gaze.</p><p>“Before anything else,&nbsp;I would like to explain the agenda for today’s meeting. First,&nbsp;the archduke of Hell has passed away last month. Because there are no official heirs, the next archduke must be selected a day sooner, if possible. I would like to gather the opinions of the Demon Lords present here and……”</p><p><em>(TL note: The region is either ‘Hell’ or ‘Gehenna’, I’m honestly not sure which to take since both seem very much possible.)</em></p><p>“Wait. Wait a second, old man.”</p><p>A girl’s sharp voice rang.</p><p>Everyone turned to look at the source of the voice.</p><p>There was no proper lighting in the ballroom, so it was dark. There were candles as large as people’s heads floating around. Those were the only sources of light. The deep yellow candles were drifting slowly through the air, occasionally reflecting this person, and occasionally reflecting that person. However, it was only for a short moment of time.&nbsp;People were soon enveloped back into the darkness.</p><p>“Because of that damn plague, all of the teleportation management offices are down. We got here riding on brooms, which none of us are cut out for, for&nbsp;dozens of hours. Do you know what that means? This is indeed the&nbsp;<strong>best</strong>&nbsp;time to clamor about boring and antique politics.”</p><p>The candle light reflected the girl’s face.</p><p>The girl had hair as white as snow.</p><p>Her eyes may have been glowing a bright golden color, but it was certain that she was looking down on everyone here except herself. No matter how you looked at her, she appeared to be no more than 14 years old, but she too was a Demon Lord. A Demon Lord who had lived for over 500 years, at that—rank 8th, Barbatos.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>For reference, I wasn’t sure if she was trying to achieve a match with her white hair, but her figure was as flat as the great plains of Siberia. She, for sure, looked like a child.</p><p>“Your highness Barbatos. We understand, but the topic is urgent……”</p><p>“Sure. An epidemic is spreading across the continent, there are 7 successors in the region of Hell&nbsp;that are&nbsp;causing a civil war, and due to the result of the civil war in the kingdom of Sardinia the nobles that were unable to win are starting to revolt. What else are we in but a shitty era? Regardless, the world has been similarly crap&nbsp;since&nbsp;one hundred years ago, two hundred years ago, and even five hundred&nbsp;years ago.”</p><p>Barbatos raised her glass with her right hand.</p><p>“Even if the conference were to be delayed by 3 hours, nothing will change, you old vampire. Drink alcohol without saying a word. Allow us to have a moment of rest.”</p><p>“Mm……”</p><p>The old gentleman, Ivar Lodbrok, opened and closed his mouth as if he was troubled. True vampires may have been nobles amongst nobles, but they were still lower than a Demon Lord. It would be difficult to straight out ignore the&nbsp;suggestion of having a drinking party.</p><p>Unless it was a Demon Lord of the same rank.</p><p>“Still ignorant as ever, Barbatos.”</p><p>This time a mature lady’s voice could be heard.</p><p>“You can drink alcohol whenever you please. You’re always drowning yourself in alcohol&nbsp;throughout the entire year anyways, so why not try restraining yourself for this one night? If the word ‘patience’ is saved into your head, that is.”</p><p>A candle light vaguely shined down onto the woman.</p><p>Completely opposite to Barbatos, the maiden had fiery red hair. Throughout the entire world, it felt like&nbsp;the only person that this woman held in contempt was Barbatos.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli whispered to me in a small voice.</p><p>“That is rank 9th, Paimon. She is well-known for her deep-rooted enmity with Barbatos.”</p><p>“I can tell that very well without any explanation, because&nbsp;the distribution is entirely&nbsp;unfair. If I was Barbatos, then I too would probably resent Paimon.”</p><p>“Distribution?”</p><p>I gestured towards Paimon with my chin. Lapis Lazuli, with a doubtful expression, followed my gaze and examined the female Demon Lord.</p><p>Her gaze fell exactly on top of Paimon’s chest. Different from Barbatos, Paimon boasted voluptuous breasts. It was proof that, in the end, nature was not fair.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli let out a sigh.</p><p>“…… Your highness. Please partake in the meeting seriously.”</p><p>“Whenever I see those two rising hills, I feel wonderment. It’s the same feeling as when you see a natural landscape and&nbsp;become&nbsp;entranced by it.”</p><p>“Please realize that your highness appears very, incredibly, tremendously vulgar right now.”</p><p>“Lala. I am a person who hates going outside more than death. I’m currently experiencing death at real-time. If I were to bore of teasing you, then how would I possibly resist the urge to kill myself?”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli went silent.</p><p>Instead, the pressure on my right foot increased.</p><p>Ignoring the pain transmitting from my toes, I grinned.</p><p>“This is the price for tormenting me on a day-to-day basis. Do suffer for me.”</p><p>“…… Did your highness truly hate being woken up in the morning that much?”</p><p>“Each individual person has their own biological clock. I am a person that physically should not wake up in the morning.”</p><p>“I guess sleeping an average of 16 hours everyday is your highness’ biological clock. This one thinks&nbsp;that the problem is not physical, but your highness’ mentality.”</p><p>“In short, are you saying that my mentality is wrong and is on the same level of being rotten to the core like wastewater?”</p><p>“Today, in this location, this one has realized for the first time that your highness has an impressive summarizing ability.”</p><p>“Lala. In a single day, I have to sleep at least 15 hours.”</p><p>“No matter how much the ample amount, this one can allow no longer than 7 hours.”</p><p>“What? 7 hours?”</p><p>My voice grew louder on its own.</p><p>“7 hours?! Are you kidding me? You might as well tell me to lay down and get back up immediately. People need at least 12 hours of sleep in order to function properly as a person!”</p><p>“This one sleeps no more than 4 hours a day. Ever since the time this one had roamed the back alleys and for 30 years since then.”</p><p>“Ooh. So this is the moment where it’s finally revealed as to why you&nbsp;had become&nbsp;such an inhumane and cold-hearted person. The reason why you were always&nbsp;temperamental as if you were on your period all the time was also revealed.”</p><p>“Your highness. Most&nbsp;people only partake in around 7 hours of sleep.”</p><p>“And&nbsp;<strong>most</strong>&nbsp;people are wrong! Did you not listen to what Barbatos had said? Did she not testify that, be it the present or the past, the world has always been utter crap? That is all because of the lack of sleep. A perfectly logical conclusion.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“That is a level of logic that would make even Aristoteles cry.”</p><p>Once again, Lapis Lazuli and I had failed at reaching a diplomatic common ground.</p><p>15 hours and 7 hours, the gap located&nbsp;between the two was too large. If this were to go&nbsp;on a war might break out. The tragedy would repeat.</p><p>It wasn’t just us two that were having our diplomatic relations deteriorate. In the ballroom, Paimon and Barbatos were heated up and conducting a psychological warfare.</p><p>Barbatos made a cynical remark.</p><p>“Paimon. Our elegant whore lady! I heard the news that you had finally had intercourse with a centaur&nbsp;yesterday. Your hips should be incredibly stiff, but I see you were able to crawl your way here quite well. Or perhaps, is it because you’re bottom mouth is already so loose that you can handle something like a centaur easily? Hm—?”</p><p>“People might think that you’re uneducated because your words are so crude. You should start learning how to have some decency, Barbatos. You’ve been fretful like a child for the past 500 years, so it’s about time you started to behave like an adult.”</p><p>Paimon raised the corners of her mouth.&nbsp;She then&nbsp;covered her mouth with a feathered fan a step late. She had shown her smirk on purpose before hiding it.</p><p>“With a body like that, you’ll probably never be intimate with&nbsp;a proper&nbsp;man. Since you haven’t been able to have a legitimate relationship even once in your life, there’s no choice but to forever be a little lady. Oh dear, I’m sorry. It’s wrong to make fun of someone because of their body…… This lady ended up being discourteous.”</p><p><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/wp-1469082946180.jpg?w=700\"></p><p>“—It’s not that I&nbsp;<strong>can’t</strong>&nbsp;get a man, but that I’m purposely&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;going into a relationship, Miss whore. I’m voluntarily single. Of course, a girl who tosses her body around like a rag towel wouldn’t understand something like that.”</p><p>“Aha. That is not so. This lady does very much understand.”</p><p>Paimon narrowed her eyes.</p><p>Ridicule glossed over her red pupils.</p><p>“You can’t pick the grapes anyways, so it’s more reassuring for your&nbsp;mental health if you were to just ignore it saying that they were&nbsp;sour grapes. No matter when, is it not delightful when witnessing people&nbsp;rationalizing with themselves, Barbatos? You could say it feels like you’re getting a peek at their low personality and intelligence……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Barbatos grinded her teeth.</p><p>I was deeply swayed by the conversation between the two Demon Lords. That was why, I immediately conveyed the emotions I was feeling to Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>“Lala. I may have a deep hatred for the outside world, however, if I were to be accompanied by those two, then the idea of going outside doesn’t seem that bad. Just&nbsp;standing here like this and listening to them is putting me in a good mood.”</p><p>“This one thinks that is because your highness is corrupted on the inside.”</p><p>“Do you think it would be possible to request&nbsp;to go on a date with the both of them at the same time? I’d go out with them, and then sneak to the back and simply watch the two of them fight.”</p><p>“Minor Gods will be shocked, the people will be shocked, and even the old sages will be so shocked that they’ll kick out of their graves because of your highness’ atrocious personality.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli let out a sigh.</p><p>“For the past 300 years, Barbatos and Paimon has gone to&nbsp;war locally with one another 14 times. Among the Demon Lords they have the worst possible relationship. &nbsp;This one, on the loyalty to your highness, advise your highness to give up on that short-lived dream.”</p><p>“They go to war every 21 years?”</p><p>War was not a kid’s play. It consumed a vast amount of manpower, supplies, and time. If they truly didn’t hate each other to the bone, then they wouldn’t do something like go to war so frequently.</p><p>“What frighteningly fierce women. I am even more interested in them.”</p><p>“This one has started to severely worry about your highness Dantalian’s preference in women. This one can only&nbsp;hope that it is&nbsp;unnecessary concern……”</p><p>“Where is the third?”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli tilted her head.</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“I’m talking about the third. The third character. The world is like a miniature universe, that is why it has the tendency to try to keep things balanced on its own. Look there. One person is a little lady who lives her life with curses hanging off her tongue, while on the other side is&nbsp;a woman pretending to be virtuous but lives her life saying whatever&nbsp;she wants. The balance of the universe is collapsed severely……”</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>“Meetings without a mediator could not possibly have been maintained for hundreds of years. There must be a dignified person who is capable of suppressing these two women, who were&nbsp;being unruly like water buffaloes in heat. That woman would most likely match my preference.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>And sure enough.</p><p>“The two of you. Calm down.”</p><p>An incredibly somber voice fell upon the ballroom.</p><p>“Due to your quarrel, the conference has stopped. How about showing a little bit of respect to Ivar Lodbrok who has stepped forward as our host.”</p><p>The Demon Lords who were arguing shut their mouths.</p><p>A candle silently reflected the face of the new speaker.</p><p>Rank 5th, Marbas.</p><p>With an Eastern European style overcoat draped over their shoulder, they had a very robust physique&nbsp;and was looking over the audience slowly with a monocle…… it was a bald man.</p><p>It was so. The third character was nothing more than a man with a burly&nbsp;frame.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli muttered.</p><p>“This one really did have no reason to worry about your highness’ preference in women.”</p><p>“…… I retract my previous statement.”</p><p>“Marbas is considerably popular with females. Although, this one did not know that it was the same with males as well.”</p><p>Once the highest ranking Demon Lord to be attending the meeting had stepped forward, the atmosphere of the ballroom became calmer. Ivar Lodbrok, receiving the help, continued on with the conference. While I moistened the inside of my mouth with wine, I listened to&nbsp;all kinds of topics.</p><div></div><p>♦</p><p>♦</p><p>♦</p><p>Time passed long-windedly.</p><p>It would have been fun if another argument were to occur, but both Barbatos and Paimon kept their mouths shut. Thus, any type of entertainment was non-existent.</p><p>Outright boredom made my eyelids heavy. If it weren’t for Lapis Lazuli constantly pinching my side, I would have most likely&nbsp;fallen asleep by now.</p><p>While I was desperately having a bloody battle against drowsiness, Paimon had finally opened her mouth.</p><p>“My dear comrades, and Ivar Lodbrok. Before we get into the discussion about the plague, there is&nbsp;an incident that we must certainly settle first.”</p><p>“What may that be, your highness?”</p><p>“The murder incident. I believe that everyone here&nbsp;is&nbsp;aware of the disgraceful event that had occurred several days ago. Our kinsmen, Andromalius. Rank 72nd Demon Lord, Andromalius, was murdered.”</p><p>Ara?</p><p>I blinked my eyes which were clouded by sleepiness.</p><p>Paimon was bringing up a rather serious subject.</p><p>“Andromalius. He was a shameful man. He behaved in ways unbefitting for a Demon Lord. However, despite all that, he was still the same Demon Lord as us.”</p><p>With light steps, Paimon made her way to the center of the ballroom. Each step she took a bit of the drowsiness in my skull was pulled out. By the time she had come to a full stop, I was already fully awake.</p><p>“No matter how big the continent is, the amount of chosen ones to be born as a Demon Lord was 72. We were a race&nbsp;of only 72 people. Each individual’s value is&nbsp;so precious that we can not be compared to the other races. That kin of ours was murdered mercilessly.”</p><p>Paimon turned her head to glare at me.</p><p>The emotions held within those red eyes, they were unmistakably hostility.</p><p>“Everyone must know full well as to why this is such a grave&nbsp;incident. The culprit to murder our kin must be punished justly.”</p><p>At once, all of the Demons Lords turned to look this way.</p><p>“……”</p><p>An alarm was going off in my head.</p><p>The sleepiness had evaporated and my&nbsp;consciousness quickly became cold. An unpredicted attack. A situation that I had not prepared for beforehand. Judging that I was facing danger, my mind operated more fiercely.</p><p>♦</p><p>Why?</p><p>♦</p><p>It felt like the space&nbsp;around me had slowed down.</p><p>‘Why is&nbsp;she attacking me when I was just standing still?’</p><p>The information that I had intentionally blocked off had started to flood in.</p><p>The Demon Lords’ clothing.</p><p>Facial expressions.</p><p>The shape of people’s mouths as they whispered to one another.</p><p>Every information was ‘gathered’ and ‘analyzed’ and then piled up as data.</p><p>For instance—Paimon.</p><p>She had glared at me only once before immediately turning her gaze away. Even now, she was delivering an impassioned speech to&nbsp;not me, but the other Demon Lords. What did this mean?</p><p>‘She isn’t attacking me because she has an emotional grudge towards me.’</p><p>If so, then.</p><p>‘She is&nbsp;attacking me for some sort of political reason. That is&nbsp;why, before attacking me, convincing the other Demons Lords has priority.’</p><p>I had temporarily accepted that hypothesis.</p><p>Thus, the starting point for deductions was obtained. I was provided a single foundation. Like a massive tree sprouting on a small piece of land, various kinds of hypothesis and deductions reached out like branches from my head.</p><p>‘What political benefit would you gain from attacking me?’</p><p>‘Dantalian is&nbsp;a ricefish. There’s nothing to gain from stabbing him.’</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>‘Then it’s the Black Death.’</p><p>An immediate answer had come out.</p><p>‘By using Andromalius’ murder as an excuse, they’ll take away the large amount of black herbs that are&nbsp;in my possession. Paimon’s goal is&nbsp;around there.’</p><p>‘An accomplice?’</p><p>‘If she were to try and hold a monopoly on all of the black herbs by herself, then the other Demon Lords would most likely oppose. There is&nbsp;an accomplice here. Who is it?’</p><p>The first stage of my deduction was complete.</p><p>I took a slight glance around me.</p><p>The amount of Demon Lords here was 32. The amount of companions that had accompanied the Demon Lords was also 32. If you included the host, Ivar Lodbrok, then there was a total of 65 people. All 65 individuals were looking back and forth between Paimon and myself.</p><p>‘There’s too much.’</p><p>I had to decrease the amount of possible suspects.</p><p>I changed my thoughts.</p><p>According to the manual engraved into my consciousness.</p><p>A more diverse number of cases.</p><p>A more natural conclusion.</p><p>Quickly.</p><p>‘What if her main objective isn’t to attack me?’</p><p>In another person’s perspective, I didn’t predict&nbsp;the plague but I had prophesied it instead. They probably thought that it wasn’t possible&nbsp;when thinking with common sense.</p><p>Someone had spread the disease on purpose. It would be more natural to judge it as so. They would also think that since Demon Lord Dantalian had no talent, the true culprit was someone else.</p><p>Culprit.</p><p>A culprit who had the capability of making&nbsp;a disease and spreading it.</p><p>My line of sight slowly moved towards a certain Demon Lord. A girl with white hair was holding her glass and silently sipping red wine.</p><p>‘Barbatos.’</p><p>‘Only necromancers could control plagues.’</p><p>The greatest necromancer in history.</p><p>The Demon Lord to have uniquely obtain the archmage title&nbsp;in the field of black magic.</p><p>In a third-party perspective, there was no one as close to being the ‘true culprit’ as Barbatos.</p><p>‘Was that it.’</p><p>My heart cooled down.</p><p>‘So that’s why it’s Paimon.’</p><p>This time I turned my gaze to look at Paimon.</p><p>Paimon was grandly holding out her fan as if she was trying to announce something. Her movements were slow. Her skirt had stopped mid-flutter and was frozen in place. Her mouth moved slowly. The scenery over there wasn’t able to keep up with my thinking process.</p><p>Paimon.</p><p>Barbatos’ arch rival.</p><p>According to her, Barbatos was the real culprit to have spread the Black Death.</p><p>Dantalian was nothing more than a chess piece that was moving in Barbatos’ stead.</p><p>‘I wonder.’</p><p>I clearly understood how unpleasant my current situation was.</p><p>Unbeknownst to me, it seems I had ended up being swept up in a political fight between these two high nobles.</p><p>This was why politicians were annoying. They’d make a fuss on their own and involved&nbsp;completely unrelated people. If they weren’t causing great harm, then I didn’t know what they were doing.</p><p>The problem was that Barbatos and Paimon had such a bad relationship that they’d go to war locally once every 21 years. Their diplomatic relationship was brutal itself.&nbsp;To the point that the word play Lapis Lazuli and I would do couldn’t possibly&nbsp;compare to what they’d do.</p><p>Whenever these two Demon Lord’s diplomatic relations worsened, a war would break out. Despite that, Paimon was meddling with ‘Dantalian who was Barbatos’ pawn’. She was accusing me while being resolute of&nbsp;the worst outcome.</p><p>The scale of the plan was too large to be attempting while relying on some simple belief. War wasn’t something you’d do thoughtlessly. Manpower was consumed, supplies were wasted, and even your mental state would be worn out.</p><p>The decisive reason as to why Paimon was&nbsp;taking action.</p><p>A reason why she would peg me as the criminal while knowing full well that the worst outcome could be war.</p><p>In other words, undeniable evidence.</p><p>‘Paimon has evidence.’</p><p>Proof that the Black Death didn’t happen by chance.</p><p>‘But what kind of proof could it be that she would……aha.’</p><p>I let out an exclamation in my head.</p><p>I see.</p><p>Why didn’t I consider this sooner?</p><p>Looking past Barbatos and Paimon, I gave a side glance to the girl standing directly besides me.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>If you thought about it then it was simple.</p><p>6/27, Lapis Lazuli&nbsp;was in the very location where the first outbreak of the Black Death had happened, and had witnessed it in person on the very day the plague had started to brew. She was standing at the starting point.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli had only gone to the site because of my advice. However, to a third-party it would seem completely different.</p><p>The succubus who had by chance&nbsp;bought the black herb, and by chance&nbsp;was the first person to witness the outbreak, and finally, by chance&nbsp;the black death turned out&nbsp;to be curable by the black herb.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>It would have appeared as so to a third-party.</p><p>It wasn’t possible, they would say.</p><p>And Paimon would have judged that ‘it wasn’t possible’.</p><p>If anything, the next scenario was more plausible. Barbatos had created the Black Death and Lapis Lazuli had used some kind of method to spread it in the&nbsp;city. Afterwards, Lapis Lazuli had escaped to Barbatos’ pawn, Dantalian……</p><p>♦</p><p>The true culprit was Barbatos.</p><p>The pawn was Dantalian.</p><p>The person to execute the plan was Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>♦</p><p>This kind of structure was established.</p><p>I would like to turn that down as nonsensical drivel, but on the contrary, Paimon would consider my claim as nonsensical drivel.</p><p>If Paimon were to ask, ‘How could you predict the outbreak of the Black Death beforehand, and why was Lapis Lazuli there?’. I could only respond with, ‘I knew about it because of the game.’ And even if I were to lie and say ‘Because I had a precognitive dream.’, I could not say anything back if they were to deem it as nonsense. Paimon would only judge it while purely thinking rationally……</p><p>‘Although, she&nbsp;ended up attacking me because of that rationality.’</p><p>Okay then.</p><p>Paimon’s actions were all explained.</p><p>If that was so, then there was only one more question left.</p><p>♦</p><p><strong>Who</strong>&nbsp;had told Paimon about Lapis Lazuli’s whereabouts?</p><p>♦</p><p>The entire time Lapis Lazuli was at the location she had been disguised.</p><p>Only a very small amount of people knew the fact that Lapis Lazuli was at the starting city&nbsp;of the Black Death, Syracuse, between 6/20 and 7/16. Speaking frankly, there were only two people.</p><p><em>(TL note: Note that Dantalian does not know about Torukel yet)</em></p><p>One person.</p><p>‘Myself who had ordered Lapis Lazuli to go there.’</p><p>Of course, I did not tell Paimon anything.</p><p>The other remaining person.</p><p>‘The person who had no choice but to know where Lapis Lazuli was working.’</p><p>In other words, her superior.</p><p>The person to receive her reports.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli’s old boss.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok—</p><p>Turning my head, I looked at the old vampire.&nbsp;The old gentleman with a nicely grown beard was standing vacantly. As if he had no involvement with this&nbsp;situation whatsoever, like a praying mantis that was hiding within tall&nbsp;grass and lying in wait to ambush, this vampire’s camouflage&nbsp;was quite remarkable.</p><p>‘Yes.’</p><p>You have been controlling everything in the background.</p><p>‘It was you.’</p><p>The accomplice was revealed.</p><p>The second stage of my speculation was complete.</p><p>‘I will admit it.’</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok was a fairly decent predator.</p><p>Like a lioness, he had tried to hunt me carefully. From beginning to end he had planned and created a net around me. Greenhorns like Demon Lord Andromalius or adventurer Riff were different from birth.</p><p>He was perhaps the strongest opponent I had faced since falling into this world.</p><p>However, there was a chance that all of my assumptions were wrong.</p><p>Before going full-scale into the hunt of Ivar Lodbrok, there was a truth that I had to verify first.</p><p>I muttered in a low voice.</p><p>“Lapis Lazuli.”</p><p>As soon as I had moved my tongue.</p><p>The time that had slowed down temporarily had returned back to its normal pace. Paimon’s movements, the whispering of other people, and even the air that I could feel on my nose, everything had regained their speed.</p><p>“…… That is why, this lady requests for the immediate punishment of Dantalian. This murder is inexcusable!”</p><p>Paimon pointed at me with her fan and spoke passionately.</p><p>“It would ony be appropriate for him to&nbsp;pay a fine of 1,000,000 Libra as compensation for the murder of Andromalius, and Dantalian himself to&nbsp;be confined in the Frozen Prison for 15 years!”</p><p>I wonder if they had thought it was an excessively severe punishment. People here and there in the ballroom had begun to stir. Half the people were watching as if they were observing something interesting, and the other half were nodding seriously as if they were enjoying this situation.</p><p>In this circumstance, Lapis Lazuli responded quietly.</p><p>“Yes, your highness?”</p><p>“I want you to follow my next orders without objecting whatsoever. Take five steps away from me, and then, as if something urgent had come up, make&nbsp;your way to the entrance of the ballroom quickly.”</p><p>“…… Should this one walk completely outside?”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli’s voice was somewhat stiff. Well, in this situation where we were being accused by the rank 9th Demon Lord, it was inevitable.</p><p>In consideration to her, I whispered as softly as I could.</p><p>“No. There is no need for that. From now on the greatest circus performance in the world is about&nbsp;to happen, so you should be here to watch it till the very end. Do make sure to observe from the VIP&nbsp;seats.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“The VIP&nbsp;seats……?”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli was slightly bewildered by my carefree attitude.</p><p>While I was whispering with her, I was carefully examining every corner of the ballroom. 65 important characters were gathered in this hall. Even if I were to be in possession of the most brilliant brain, if I was to keep an eye on all 65 people here then I had to be a bit earnest.</p><p>“I will count down from 5.”</p><p>I commanded her in a subdued tone.</p><p>“Move the instant&nbsp;the number&nbsp;‘one’ comes out of my mouth. Five. Four. Three. Two……”</p><p>One.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli moved her feet.</p><p>Following my orders, she took five steps back. Then, slowly raising her pace, she made her way towards the entrance of the ballroom.</p><p>‘If there is an accomplice other than Ivar Lodbrok.’</p><p>I concentrated my cognition&nbsp;to every individual that was present in this ballroom.</p><p>‘They will pay attention to not the puppet, Dantalian, but the true person to execute the plan, Lapis Lazuli.’</p><p>65 people.</p><p>Among these people, the person to watch Lapis Lazuli till the very end was the ‘enemy’.</p><p>Once Lapis Lazuli went further away, 21 out of 65 people had turned to look at her out of instinct. But it was only for a short moment. People soon lost interest in the&nbsp;movements of this small succubus, and turned their gaze back to either Paimon or myself. To them, they had no reason to pay attention to Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>‘Come out.’</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>I wonder if it was because my brain had worked fiercely a second ago, as a sign of the heat, a single drop of sweat had formed on my forehead.</p><p>‘Show yourselves, my prey.’</p><p>Once 3 seconds had passed the 21 suspects decreased to 15.</p><p>After the fifth second, the 15 suspects drastically decreased to 4.</p><p>Finally after 11 seconds had passed…… a single person.</p><p>Only Ivar Lodbrok.</p><p>The vampire disguised as an aged gentleman, while wrinkling his forehead, watched Lapis Lazuli till the very end.</p><p>‘Aha.’</p><p>I twisted the edges of my mouth.</p><p>‘So you’re telling me that there are no other accomplices aside from Paimon?’</p><p>Thus, the third stage of my deduction was complete.</p><p>Found the culprit’s motive&nbsp;— found the culprit’s accomplice&nbsp;— and finally confirmed the authenticity of my speculations&nbsp;— all three steps had been completely fulfilled.</p><p>‘Isn’t two people not enough, Ivar Lodbrok?’</p><p>In truth, it was incredibly lacking.</p><p>Oh, clever vampire.</p><p>Not only Paimon, you were supposed to also bring Barbatos and Marbas to your side. You said you were the richest person in the demon world. Wouldn’t it have been possible to bribe Barbatos and Marbas if you had used all of your fortune?</p><p>But to bring only one Demon Lord.</p><p>Oh, at most for it to be only Paimon!</p><p>In order to tear apart the single most scorned outcast in the world, I had spent my entire fortune and received a loan of 10,000 gold. I had put my entire future on the line.&nbsp;<strong>This was what it meant to be a lion putting their all into hunting a rabbit!</strong></p><p>If someone were to come at you with the intent to kill, then you do not hesitate to use all that you have.</p><p>Being met with such discourtesy, the deepest part of my soul&nbsp;lamented.</p><p>The world truly was overflowing with people ignorant of&nbsp;etiquette. As a person who did their best to live life as courteously as possible, the tragedy of this world always enveloped a miserable feeling around me.</p><p>How could people be so shameless?</p><p>Why couldn’t people be a bit more lazy when it came to hunting others?</p><p>Why were&nbsp;people, who had&nbsp;endured their laziness in order to hunt another, behave so reluctantly in regards to spending a couple of more coins, when they should have been putting their all into the hunt?</p><p>My second half little sister had evaluated that I had the most fiendish brain out of every human in the world, but that was wrong. I just didn’t understand why people lived their lives being ‘casually sincere’. I was thickheaded in this area……</p><p>There was nothing I could do about it.</p><p>I will personally teach you what proper etiquette&nbsp;is.</p><p>I will make you regret not risking your own life when you yourself had decided on your own to disrupt another person’s comfortable life.</p><p>“This lady would like to suggest a formal hearing! I, Paimon, as the rank 9th Demon Lord, and also as the lord in charge of justice, would like to incriminate rank 71st, Demon Lord Dantalian.”</p><p>Yes.</p><p>For starters, Paimon.</p><p>You were the first problem.</p><p>You, by thinking rationally, had judged that I was Barbatos’ pawn. That I had aided and abetted the spreading of the disease and did nothing while millions&nbsp;of innocent lives were dying.</p><p>In &lt;Dungeon Attack&gt;, Paimon, unbecoming of a Demon Lord, was friendly towards humans. She had the hobby of dressing herself up as&nbsp;a human and&nbsp;hunting for men. Even in the game, the main character would end up meeting Paimon, who was disguised as a human, by chance while roaming the city.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Paimon falls for the hero at first sight. And, until the hero came across, she had insistently&nbsp;made passes at him. Even when she ended up being impaled by the hero’s sword in the end,</p><p>— This is an already dying body.</p><p>— Could you not bestow upon this lady a final kiss?</p><p>She confesses her love to the hero like so.</p><p>The hero, unable to deny her dying wish, kisses Paimon. Although numerous female heroines aimed for the first kiss of the hero’s, the person to steal his first kiss was Paimon, a Demon Lord who was&nbsp;the enemy of mankind. It was a rather weird love story.</p><p>Because of the recently spread Black Death, numerous amounts of humans&nbsp;were continuing to die off. In the position of Paimon, who considered humans to be intellectual beings of equal rights, the Black Death was an unforgivable calamity.</p><p>‘I can not forgive Barbatos for this tragedy.’</p><p>‘I will also punish Dantalian who is&nbsp;behaving as your pawn.’</p><p>Up to here, it was fine.</p><p>From a common-sense point of view, this was correct.</p><p>It was an everyday occurrence for people to mistake another for a criminal as they lived their lives. However, when thinking rationally, were a misunderstanding to occur, should you not attempt to converse with the person first?</p><p>Why would you attack right off the bat?</p><p>Are you on your period? Were you too, perhaps, also under the influence of the&nbsp;forever-on-your-period syndrome, and was being swept away by your uncontrollable emotional turbulence? That’s a big problem. I recommend that you go to a doctor and get your symptoms prescribed and immediately treated.</p><p>But before that, I’ll fix that head of yours.</p><p>Be a good child and learn what true etiquette is.</p><p>♦</p><hr><p>TL note: Why was this chapter so frustrating to write? Oh, that’s right, I kept getting interrupted mid-translation to go do some errands or pick something up and couldn’t properly focus on translating. I probably shouldn’t, but I apologize for being late by a day in uploading this! I honestly wanted to see how long I could go continuously uploading a chapter every 2 days.</p><p>ALSO, THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE. The next part&nbsp;will take much longer to write because I’ve decided to split Chapter 5 into 2 parts. Thus meaning, part 2 is going to probably be over 12k words(possibly a lot more). The reason why is because the next part is absolutely amazing. I can not make you guys go through even a single cliff hanger for&nbsp;anything that is coming up next. You guys would absolutely hate me if I did.</p><p>So yeah, next chapter will most likely take twice as long because of that. So I’ll see you guys around the middle of next week!</p>"

      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><p>Chapter 5 – The Most Extravagant Circus (Part 2)</p><p>Amidst the uproarious atmosphere in the ballroom.</p><p>“…… The one with the highest rank amongst us, is myself. It would only be appropriate for a Demon Lord to be the judge of a conflict between two Demon Lords.”</p><p>I wonder if he had thought that he couldn’t remain as a spectator anymore, but rank 5th Demon Lord Marbas had stepped forward.</p><p>“Ivar Lodbrok. I shall be temporarily taking the role as the host. I’m sorry, but the weight of this hearing is too much for me to leave in your hands.”</p><p>“As you desire, your highness.”</p><p>The old vampire obediently backed off.</p><p>“Hm.”</p><p>Marbas stood in the center of the hall.</p><p>The way his legs were standing firmly made it feel like he was a gigantic tree. His stability was remarkable. This bald man with a burly stature was knitting his brows a fair amount, as if he didn’t really find this situation to be pleasing at all.</p><p>“I am rank 5th. As the Demon Lord in charge of nobleness, I shall formally receive Paimon’s request. The accused is rank 71st. No name, Demon Lord Dantalian.</p><p>Marbas’ announcement weighed heavily on the surrounding.</p><p>His dignified voice would not allow any objections. The Demon Lords lowered their gazes, and the faeries floated into a line and carefully bowed.</p><p>“Excluding the people directly involved, intervention from a third-party is strictly prohibited. Dantalian. The one accused on this Walpurgis Night. Come forth and face your accuser.”</p><p>It would only be appropriate to obey the host.</p><p>Taking a couple of steps forward, I stood at the exact center of the ballroom.</p><p>“……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Paimon and myself, we stared at each other while leaving a slight gap between us.</p><p>Like how duels would start between gladiators in the Rome Colosseum.</p><p>“Once both sides has finished their refutation, we shall decide on whose opinion is right by majority vote. First, I shall present the right to question Dantalian to the accuser, Paimon.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Paimon grabbed both ends of her skirt and bowed.</p><p>It felt like time had stood still on the folds of her politely raised skirt.</p><p>“Thank you for accepting this hearing.”</p><p>Paimon slowly glared this way.</p><p>“Shall we confirm all of the facts first then? Dantalian.”</p><p>“As you wish, your highness.”</p><p>I bobbed my head in greeting.</p><p>In truth, it was the first time we were facing each other, and yet there were reserved no actions between us. Hostility was more explicit than goodwill.</p><p>“You, on the 8th month and 16th day, at the daybreak of 4 o’clock, murdered Demon Lord Andromalius in the Hermes’ Plaza of Niflheim. Is this lady correct?”</p><p>“That is correct. I admit this.”</p><p>“And, Dantalian. You, knowing full well that the other party was a Demon Lord, murdered him anyway. Is this lady wrong?”</p><p>“That is also correct. Ah, but if I were to respond more accurately.”</p><p>I raised my shoulders.</p><p>“I did not know he was a Demon Lord from the very beginning. While I was drinking beer in the plaza, some young greenhorn was beating up the elderly. I had wondered what kind of bastard it was. And it turned out it was a Demon Lord. I was a bit surprised.”</p><p>“…… In other words, you did not murder the Demon Lord on accident, but you had murdered him with the intention to do so.”</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>“I apologize, your highness Paimon. But there is a slight misunderstanding.”</p><p>“A misunderstanding?”</p><p>Paimon creased her brows.</p><p>“What kind of misunderstanding could be in this clear truth?”</p><p>“I’m referring to Andromalius. Swearing to the Goddesses, your highness Paimon, I would have killed that mongrel regardless of the fact of him being a Demon Lord or not.”</p><p>People started to stir.</p><p>Paimon frowned and warned me.</p><p>“……Dantalian. Today is the Walpurgis Night, and you are currently being accused of murder. How about making your way of speech a bit more polite?”</p><p>“Ooh. Excuse me, but I can not do so. Your highness, with a delighted mind, I will continue to call Andromalius a mongrel. Believe me. It was only appropriate for that bastard to die.”</p><p>“You……”</p><p>“Honestly, it’s a bit regrettable. I should have gifted that fool with a more painful death. I had simply ended it by stabbing him in the throat with a dagger once. He really was garbage, roaming through the alleyways like a bum. It’s obvious as to how weak he was.”</p><p>The stirring grew much louder.</p><p>I was purposely exaggerating my words and making them more offensive.</p><p>Marbas had said that we would decide who was right by majority vote. As much as Paimon was the rank 9th Demon Lord, she had that many followers as well. So if a normal battle of votes were to happen just like this? As the person who doesn’t even have a single follower, my fate was certain defeat.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Thus, I had to make an ally.</p><p>The Demon Lord who hated Paimon.</p><p>The Demon Lord who preferred crude words over gentle words.</p><p>And most importantly, the high-class Demon Lord to have as much followers as Paimon.</p><p>‘Barbatos.’</p><p>That was so.</p><p>I was not responding to Paimon, but I was appealing to Barbatos instead. Now, watch me carefully. There’s a rookie here that should certainly suit your preference.</p><p>You want to get a shot in on Paimon, right? You should still have some piled up rage from losing in that argument earlier. I shall fulfill that desire in your stead. Barbatos. All you have to do is pick me during the majority vote. Albeit temporary, it will be an amazing alliance……</p><p>“Measure your words, Dantalian!”</p><p>Paimon shouted.</p><p>“Andromalius was our kin!”</p><p>“I can only agree with half of your highness’ opinion. Andromalius was not simply one of our kin. He was a disgraceful member of our kin. Ah, everyone! Please! Let us be more honest.”</p><p>I quickly turned to look around.</p><p>“Just because that mongrel did not want to pay for his alcohol, he had assaulted the bar owner. The owner was an old dwarf who was so aged that his back was crooked. But, that’s not all. I had done some research later on and found out that the amount of citizens he had killed in Niflheim alone was 54 people!”</p><p>“That is……”</p><p>“There are even 12 kids included in that list. Did you all know this? That guy had whipped these kids to death simply because they did not lower their heads to him. But if you were to add up not only the casualties but the injured as well, then the total would be 327 victims. Do keep in mind, this is only the number of publicly known victims. Everyone. If someone were to tell me that that mongrel had raped a young girl and threw her corpse away in the sewers, I wouldn’t be surprised! Oh, Goddesses! Please order the devils of Hell to punish Andromalius for all of eternity!”</p><p>“You, really……”</p><p>Paimon opened her mouth.</p><p>“On what nerve, before this lady…… Dantalian. This lady can accuse you again for contempt of court. Fix your tone immediately.”</p><p>The corners of my mouth contorted.</p><p>Let’s take a step back for now.</p><p>“…… My apologies, your highness Paimon. I would also like to apologize to all of the lords here today as well. I do not have the intentions to disgrace everyone here.”</p><p>I placed my palm on my forehead as if I was tremendously regretting the harsh statement I had just made.</p><p>Rampancy and honesty were two different things. Rampancy was the act of pushing yourself onto others and being a nuisance. On the other hand, honesty was the act of cooking yourself to look appealing and then serving yourself to others. As if you were telling them to ‘savor me’.</p><p>People liked honest and modest individuals. If I were to be well-behaved every once in a while, then the other party wouldn’t consider me as that much of an annoyance. With sad puppy dog eyes, I once again gazed around at the audience.</p><p>“Everyone. As you can see, I am nothing more than a fool who is unable to keep even a single thing precious to me by my side. Rank 71st. I am a no-named ricefish that has no commendable record or title…… That is my true essence.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“However, despite being like that, I did not beat up an elderly man to avoid paying my bill. I did not assault 327 innocent civilians, and I did not kill 54 people among them.”</p><p>I lowered my voice by a notch.</p><p>Before I knew it, the ballroom had become silent.</p><p>“…… That was on the 8th month and 16th day. To be precise, four days ago. I had heard the sound of an old man crying out in the distance. And at that moment, I made eye contact with Andromalius. Your highness Paimon. Do you, perhaps, know what that guy had said the moment he looked at me?”</p><p>“…… To lower your gaze, is what I heard from a witness.”</p><p>“To be more accurate, it was, ‘What are you supposed to be? You aren’t going to lower your eyes?’.”</p><p>Several people around me clicked their tongues.</p><p>I made a bitter smile.</p><p>“What happened next was even more of a sight. Andromalius came over to where I was and assaulted my escorts. I had respectfully warned him to stop. And yet, Andromalius did not listen. He had then proceeded to hit my lover, who was also my vassal, and knocked her to the ground.”</p><p>I then pleaded.</p><p>“Your highness Paimon. What was I supposed to do in such a situation? Should I have dismissed my escorts and allowed myself to be under harms way? Or would it have been better to stay still and keep watch over my lover, while she was being struck and covered in dirt?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Paimon did not answer.</p><p>The sensible and cultured Paimon could not behave boldly here. It was because she was caught in her own sense of justice that her mouth had stopped. She had checkmated herself.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Now.</p><p>The service time of showing humility and acting cute was over.</p><p>I slowly started to raise my voice.</p><p>“I will say it once again, everyone. Andromalius. He was a mongrel that did not deserve the right to even be referred to as a Demon Lord. Is it not the innocent civilians that were sacrificed that deserved to be consoled? Are they not the true victims that deserved to be compensated?”</p><p>Triggering sympathy.</p><p>“Because of parasites like Andromalius, the impression of all the Demon Lords became worse. Andromalius was not something like our kin! If it was truly for our race then, everyone! We were not supposed to follow the format of sacrificing 71 people for 1 man. We were supposed to follow the format of getting rid of 1 man for 71 people!”</p><p>Make him into the public enemy.</p><p>“Thus, I would like to ask. Your highness Paimon. Do you still consider Andromalius as our kin? Are you going to protect that larva-like Andromalius till the very end, while throwing away the rest of your race?”</p><p>A leading threat.</p><p>By making use of all kinds of rhetorical techniques.</p><p>I stared straight at Paimon.</p><p>“Your highness. Please answer.”</p><p>“This lady……”</p><p>Paimon shut her lips tightly.</p><p>A terrified stillness fell over the ballroom.</p><p>It was then.</p><p>Clap.</p><p>An applause could be heard from somewhere.</p><p>Barbatos was clapping her hands. People were looking at Barbatos with a blank expression. Seeing that, Barbatos tilted her head and smiled.</p><p>“What? His words are right.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“I, too, honestly wanted to kill Andromalius since awhile back. But that worm-like brat did rather well staying out of my sight. Good job, rookie. Thanks for going through the trouble to exterminate that parasite in our stead.”</p><p>Barbatos continued to clap her hands.</p><p>And, following suit, one or two people at a time started to join in and applauded as well. Until eventually, the majority of the Demon Lord were giving an ovation. The amount of Demon Lords who did not clap and simply glared at me until the very end was 10 people. They were most likely Paimon’s followers.</p><p>♦</p><p>[Your devilish performance has captivated the people!]</p><p>[Demon Lord Marbas’ affection went up by 1.]</p><p>[Demon Lord Barbatos’ affection went up by 2.]</p><p>[Demon Lord Zepar’s affection went up by 2.]</p><p>♦</p><p>I’m sorry to say this, but you guys were just downgraded to the minority.</p><p>The judgement for hearings was purely done based on majority logic, and unfortunately, an institutional strategy that showed consideration to the minority did not exist. That was the limit to a primitive political system. If you think that it’s unfair then go develop democracy. Also, go start the French Revolution while you’re at it. Although it also felt like there was a high chance that a guillotine would cut off a Demon Lord’s head, oh well. There was a rule that progression was followed by the sacrifice of the minority. You could only accept your destiny.</p><p>“Be silent. I said that third-party intervention was prohibited.”</p><p>Marbas warned everyone sternly to be quiet.</p><p>“Especially you, Barbatos. That clapping just now was an act done to interfere with the hearing on purpose. Do not do it again.”</p><p>“Sorry about that, geezer. I was just purely moved. It’s been a long time since a useful guy came crawling out from the lowest ranking Demon Lords, they’re usually all trash. I didn’t have any intentions on insulting the prestige of the hearing.”</p><p>“I do not care about your intentions. I only care about the outcome of actions. Barbatos. As long as we aren’t in a relationship, do you not think that it would only be a waste of time to be considering the intentions of others?”</p><p>“Hm? Did you just indirectly confess to me, you geezer?”</p><p>“If you shut your mouth this instant, then I feel like love might spring forth.”</p><p>“What is this? I can’t miss out on my chance of getting a boyfriend for the first time in 500 years.”</p><p>Barbatos jokingly shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>I was able to get a basic grasp on what kind of relationship these two had. Barbatos was an incurable mischievous little sister, and Marbas was the older brother who had to deal with the constant stress of solving each and every immature antic of his little sister. The one to receive the most loss in this brother and sister relationship was the wholesome older brother. I knew it was so since I had experience dealing with 6 little sisters. You have my condolences, Marbas.</p><p>Marbas, as if he was shuddering, shook his head left to right.</p><p>“I shall end this hearing around here. As I told you all before, we shall decide with a majority vote on whose opinion is right. Now, with a show of hands……”</p><p>“Wait a moment.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>At that moment, Paimon spoke in a hurry.</p><p>Marbas raised a brow.</p><p>“What is it? Is there something more you’d like to say?”</p><p>“Yes, there are still some questions that this lady has yet to inquire Dantalian.”</p><p>“Paimon……”</p><p>Marbas took off his monocle and wiped it with a handkerchief.</p><p>Marbas’ voice became softer, as if he were talking to an old comrade.</p><p>“You and I have spent the past 500 years knowing one another. 500 years is quite the long period of time, don’t you think?”</p><p>“…… Indeed, it was a rather difficult period of time. Marbas.”</p><p>“As you would know about me, I as well, know about you. I will honestly confess as to why I did not hide my bitter mood throughout this entire hearing. Paimon. I know full well that there was no chance that you would sincerely want to protect Andromalius. If anything, it would be the complete opposite. It would only be appropriate for you to despise a man like Andromalius.”</p><p>Paimon became silent.</p><p>Marbas, after completely cleaning his monocle, put it on again. The golden frame of his monocle silently reflected the light of a candle.</p><p>“Tonight is the Walpurgis Night, Paimon. It’s the Walpurgis Night. At a time, this was a gathering that all Demon Lords were obligated to attend, but now it has lost its past virtue and we are barely able to have the majority of the members here. Baal, Agares, Vassago, and Gamigin…… In the now, where the entire continent is struggling with an unprecedented plague, where are the Demon Lords who were of a higher rank than myself, and what are they doing?”</p><p>Paimon lowered her head.</p><p>“Marbas. More than anyone else, you are the one to be the most committed to the demon-kind. This lady sincerely expresses her respect to you.”</p><p>“We respect one another. Therefore, the Demon Lords that did not attend this meeting— the ones that are located throughout the demon world, while being indifferent and only concerned for their own personal pleasures, let us avoid the situation where we are laughed upon by these Demon Lords.”</p><p>Marbas spoke.</p><p>“Just for the claim alone that someone had tried to protect Andromalius during the Walpurgis Night is more than enough reason for people to ridicule us. Oh dear, I can already hear the mocking laugh coming from Agares. I shall ask of you frankly. Please do not worsen this predicament any further.”</p><p>Paimon bit her lips.</p><p>“……Let this lady have one more chance.”</p><p>She had placed her right hand on her chest and bowed deeply.</p><p>“Please, allow me to have this final chance.”</p><p>Marbas stroke his beard.</p><p>The Demon Lord who belonged to the 9th rank among Demon Lords had gone as far as to lower her head even after hearing Marbas’ speech. It would probably be difficult for Marbas to enforce his thoughts any further in this state. It was a problem of keeping face and maintaining formality. Eventually, Marbas gave a single nod.</p><p>“Hm.”</p><p>Except, you will not say anything else besides that. Do what you want, but do not expect my help afterwards. It contained that kind of meaning. Paimon returned the nod and looked straight at me.</p><p>“Dantalian.”</p><p>The first round was over.</p><p>She had the look as if she was telling me that the genuine second round was about to begin.</p><p>I spoke calmly.</p><p>“Your highness Paimon. There is something that I wish to tell you beforehand.”</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>“I have no emotion towards your highness Paimon whatsoever.”</p><p>Paimon narrowed her brows.</p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p>“Even if your highness found fault in the incident with Andromalius, I understand your highness. In the end, I will bear no ill will.”</p><p>Despite everything, she was still a sensible and cultured individual.</p><p>Additionally, she had equipped a splendid pair of breasts on her chest. I worshipped the universe, revered the laws of nature, and praised beautiful breasts. Paimon, it was not too late to back out now.</p><p>I made a smooth smile.</p><p>“We could do a toast right this instant and reconcile.”</p><p>Step down from here.</p><p>If you didn’t want to be torn apart by fangs and bleed out, this was your final chance.</p><p>However.</p><p>“This lady has requested for a hearing in order to distinguish what is right or wrong. I did not come here to drink wine with you.”</p><p>In response to my advice, Paimon had shown a clearly displeased face. As if she was bothered by the fact that someone who was merely rank 71st would even bring up such a thing.</p><p>I nodded several times to display that I had understood.</p><p>Occasionally, I’d have the suspicion that I was speaking in an alien language. Thus meaning, that I had a language system that was completely different from everyone else. I didn’t know why, but we would be able to understand each other, but that was merely luck on an astronomical chance, and in truth we were speaking in two completely different languages. For example, when I told them a line with the meaning of ‘if you don’t want to see blood then back away now’, in their language they would hear it as ‘please punch me in the face’.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I thought this was a rather strong hypothesis.</p><p>In my entire life I had given warnings like this hundreds of time, but how would one explain as to why not even a single person had ever respected my warning? There was always a justifiable reason behind why I had become a NEET.</p><p>I was the intelligent life form to have been born as a miracle by astronomical odds and preestablished harmony.</p><p>‘Don’t talk nonsense, big brother.’</p><p>‘Big brother is nothing more than a coward of poor quality.’</p><p>Of course, there were other people who had brought forward their own hypothesis.</p><p>Like a stubborn old professor from an academy who had made use his authority to suppress an original theory, so too did I listen without a word to whatever Paimon was clamoring about.</p><p>“…… This lady has employed an executive from the Keuncuska Firm as my exclusive consultant for quite a while now. That executive, not too long ago, had told this lady some rather alarming news.”</p><p>Aha.</p><p>So there was a messenger going back and forth between Ivar Lodbrok and Paimon. How clever. Since olden times, it was only appropriate for remarkable schemers to not go anywhere personally, but to make use of a subordinate. That was why I had hired a charming and competent succubus recently. It was obvious, I was the greatest schemer after all.</p><p>“This lady believes that she doesn’t have to inform everyone of the recent calamity that is sweeping through the continent. The Black Death, this terrifying curse is taking the lives of both humans and demons indiscriminately……”</p><p>In addition, it was also filling my vault abundantly.</p><p>Hello, people of the continent. I’d like to give some words of comfort to the people who are struggling with the Black Death. Do not worry. With the simple payment of merely 10 gold coins, you could obtain the cure to the disease, the black herb. Save your life with money.</p><p>I did not think that this was an evil thing to do. If this went according to the original history in&nbsp;, the discovery of the cure was supposed to happen on 1507 on the Continental calendar, which was 2 years from now. People would die off helplessly for those two years.</p><p>Right now, people already knew about the effects of the black herb, thanks to my efforts. Except, since I had a monopoly over it, the only people capable of buying it were the minority of people; nobles, the rich, and bourgeois families. I planned to maintain this current market price for at least a year.</p><p>The majority of the poor commoners that were unable to obtain the money to buy the cure would die off. In this globally severe calamity, only the nobles and the wealthy will survive.</p><p>Of course, people would scorn me.</p><p>Like how Paimon was despising me right now.</p><p>It was fine to curse at me and call me a money-grubbing demon.</p><p>My plan was more profound than they could possibly imagine.</p><p>Despite how I was, I still planned to keep my civil duties as a person. Out of everyone in the world, it was a duty that only I could perform.</p><p>“…… Thankful to small mercies, there is a cure to the disease. Everyone. Do you all, perhaps, know who was the first person to discover that the black herb could treat the disease? It was Dantalian here. That was what the executive from the Keuncuska Firm had told this lady.”</p><p>People started to make a commotion.</p><p>Paimon spurred her voice.</p><p>“That’s not all. Dantalian had bought 30,000 black herbs before the plague had even occurred. This lady is unable to understand this part.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Dantalian. You not only knew when the Black Death was going to spread, but you had also gone further than that and knew what the cure to that disease was. The cure to a disease that had spread for the first time in history.”</p><p>Paimon raised her feather fan and pointed it towards me.</p><p>“How could one explain this? The answer is simple. Dantalian, you are the very culprit who had spread the Black Death!”</p><p>%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-1-page-392</p><p>Paimon’s sharp thundering voice shook the ceiling.</p><p>People made a bigger commotion. The ballroom, in a bad meaning, started to get noisy. Was what Paimon had said the truth? Did someone create the Black Death artificially……? It felt like people were looking this way as if they were reprimanding me.</p><p>“Paimon. Slandering is not allowed in this hearing.”</p><p>Marbas spoke in a stern voice.</p><p>“The accusation that Dantalian is the culprit to have spread the plague. Are you making that claim while in possession of undeniable proof?”</p><p>“Dantalian, similar to this lady, had an exclusive consultant from the Keuncuska Firm. The procedure of buying the herbs was done through that consultant. The details on how Dantalian bought the cure, everything can most certainly be confirmed here!”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The clamour in the ballroom became more intense because of Paimon’s definite answer.</p><p>Marbas made a wry face and turned his gaze, and on that spot was the representative of the Keuncuska Firm. The vampire Ivar Lodbrok stood with a cane in his hand.</p><p>“Vampire. Is Paimon’s alleged statement the truth?”</p><p>“Ooh, honorable Marbas.”</p><p>The old vampire bowed his head.</p><p>“This one, because of a fearful mind, can not help but hesitate to judge whether something is the truth or not. However, if your highness so orders for it, this one can bring the evidence needed for this discussion whenever it is desired.”</p><p>“Are you saying that you can present the evidence right this instant?”</p><p>“Please give this one the order, and this one shall present it promptly.”</p><p>The rumbling from the people grew even louder.</p><p>‘Was all that true then?’, was the suspicion that had started to spread.</p><p>The people here were probably thinking along these lines. Paimon and Ivar were both individuals with an immense amount of authority. Surely, these two wouldn’t stubbornly insist that the plague was spread artificially for no reason. They had some type of evidence…… And thus, the people turned to glare at me as a result. Their gaze were filled with doubt.</p><p>It was at that moment, laughter could be heard.</p><p>At first, I couldn’t tell who was laughing. It was peculiar. I was still splitting up my concentration to focus on all 65 members in this ballroom. I couldn’t see even a single person who was laughing, and yet the laughing grew louder, and for some reason the eyes that were looking at me were becoming wider.</p><p>It was then that I had realized that the laughter was coming out from my own mouth. I could guarantee it, but this was not an act. I could not stop laughing. I spoke with a voice still filled with laughter.</p><p>“At most, I had endured my laziness and did my best. I could have not cared for something like a plague and have left it alone. That’s why I’m tired. It is determined that the reward for good will is always spite. Seriously, be it that world or this world, the worldly ways are always the same……”</p><p>“……What are you talking about, Dantalian?”</p><p>“I apologize, your highness Paimon. And to also my dear kinsmen. I had witnessed a part of the universe, so I was deeply moved for a moment. No matter where, people do not change. My decision to shut myself in a cave was quite the correct choice.”</p><p>Plato was wrong.</p><p>People were capable of digging further into a cave.</p><p>It meant that it wasn’t a one-way street to avoid people. (TL note: Allegory of the Cave)</p><p>Putting a smile on my lips, I turned to Marbas.</p><p>“Oh, honorable Marbas. I, of course, would like to declare my innocence. That is why, could you not allow me to have a short private conversation with the chief of the Keuncuska Firm for a moment?”</p><p>“A private conversation?”</p><p>“There is no need to be concerned. I may have said a private conversation, but it will be nothing more than exchanging a couple of lines. Why the chief executive of the Keuncuska Firm would be suspecting me, I have a general assumption as to what it might be. I simply want to see if I could solve this misunderstanding. It will not take that much time.”</p><p>Marbas nodded.</p><p>“If it is just that, then there is no problem. I will allow it.”</p><p>“I thank you sincerely.”</p><p>I gestured for Ivar Lodbrok to approach me.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok, with his head lowered, made hurried steps towards my direction. The vampire with a remarkable acting ability and splendid disguise immediately apologized as soon as he was near.</p><p>“My apologies, your highness. It is our firm’s rule to clearly make certain types of information public, if one of our clients were to request it. No matter what conclusion comes from this Walpurgis Night, this one swears that the Keuncuska Firm will assist your highness Dantalian till the very end.”</p><p>“Those are indeed reassuring words.”</p><p>I chuckled.</p><p>On the other hand, Ivar Lodbrok’s expression was incredibly stern. Laugh a little. A Demon Lord like myself was laughing. If you shared your enjoyment then it would double. It would be polite to go along with this side’s antics.</p><p>Well, from the beginning, was it already a vampire that had lost all concept of what manners were? That was fine. I don’t particularly dislike teaching others. I shall patiently and earnestly tutor you personally.</p><p>“It is a shame that our first meeting is in this kind of situation.”</p><p>“This one thinks the same, your highness. If it means to regain your highness’ honor, then this one, Ivar Lodbrok, shall drag this old body and do whatever it takes to aid your highness.”</p><p>“Old body. Hm, old body, is it?”</p><p>I grinned.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“I’m sorry, chief. But I do not consider you to be old.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“You still appear like you’re full of youth to me.”</p><p>“That……this one appreciates your highness’ kind words.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok made a confused expression. As if wondering why I was suddenly complimenting them in this sort of situation. It seemed our true vampire here was a bit slow-witted. To the very least, it was a type of student that tutors did not like to teach. A type of student who took 1 hour just to understand one math equation. If it were me I’d receive no less than 100,000 won an hour to teach this kind of student. But for this occasion, I think I’ll make it free of charge.</p><p>“No, no. I mean that I am truly jealous of your youth.”</p><p>“……?”</p><p>Does he still not understand?</p><p>I was a teacher with a lot of patience. If I were to calmly explain each and every part, then I was certain that I would be able to make even a failed student obtain a great moral discovery and become proficient in a single subject. I did not easily throw away my hopes for people.</p><p>Thus, I leaned down.</p><p>I moved my mouth near Ivar Lodbrok’s ear.</p><p>Filling each and every one of my words with the goodwill from my heart—</p><p>I whispered softly.</p><p>♦</p><p>“I’m curious as to how well your true body is doing.”</p><p>“…………”</p><p>♦</p><p>%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-1-page-398</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Mute shock.</p><p>It was vividly transmitted that the other person had fallen into a speechless distress.</p><p>I very much enjoyed this sort of stillness. Finally, my poor student had grasped the laws of nature thanks to me. As the teacher who did his best to teach his student, I could only be proud.</p><p>Even the name of this law was straightforward.</p><p>The law of the jungle.</p><p>Realizing who was the hunter and who was the prey.</p><p>To make them regret how irresponsible they were for having plucked the mane of a lion.</p><p>Whenever I made fools, those who believed that they were the people in power, realize that they were nothing more than pork tripe on top of a grill, it felt like I was contributing to the nature of all things within this speck of dust in the universe and thus made me feel pleased. It would be fine to say that this was one of the very few pleasures in my life.</p><p>“How, that……”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok’s voice shook.</p><p>“How, do you know……?”</p><p>“Your blonde hair is quite beautiful.”</p><p>Another loveable silence fell before us.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok.</p><p>There was no way that I wouldn’t know about this old gentlemen’s identity.</p><p>was a game played in the perspective of the human hero. That was why the hero was not able to have a close relationship with the demons. You went around slaying all kinds of demons anyways, so who would want such a thing?</p><p>Regardless, there was a unique vampire heroine who would surrender to the hero. She would overcome the racial gap between each other and fall in love with the hero. There was even a special route made specifically for her in the game.</p><p>The heroine’s name, Ivar Lodbrok.</p><p>That was so.</p><p>The true identity of this old gentleman with a wicked appearance was a heroine whose growth had forever stopped, leaving her with the appearance of a young girl.</p><p>That was why I was surprised when I first saw this old man, since their appearance from head to toe was completely different with their in-game character.</p><p>—That’s Ivar Lodbrok?”</p><p>—Yes. That man is the wealthiest person in the demon world, the owner of Keuncuska Firm, and a true vampire, Ivar Lodbrok.</p><p>I was able to mostly grasp what the hidden circumstances were.</p><p>According to the scenarios revealed in&nbsp;, Ivar Lodbrok’s story was like so: In the past she was incredibly loyal to a certain Demon Lord, but she was abruptly betrayed by the very Demon Lord she was serving and faced a near death situation. Afterwards, Ivar Lodbrok swore that she will never be used by a Demon Lord again and in order to fulfil that goal, she had begun to live her life while moving her conscience around her dolls, while cursing and scorning every Demon Lord.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok betrayed the Demon Lord Allied Forces at a decisive moment, and was one of the main reasons as to why the hero’s forces were able to obtain victory. It was an exemplary case showing that it wasn’t too late for a noble person to achieve revenge even if it took 100 years.</p><p>As a person who had played through all of Ivar Lodbrok’s scenarios and her specific route— I, of course, knew of her real appearance, and also knew very well the fact that her real body was hidden under the snowy fields of the kingdom of Moscow.</p><p>It was a secret that Ivar had whispered to only the hero.</p><p>Since the hero wasn’t to appear until the year 1515 on the Continental calendar, in this current time, it was a tragedy that no one was supposed to know of.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Except for me.</p><p>“I am not concerned about something like your old body. I’m merely worried for the girl whose body is buried underneath a cold snowy field that is being ravaged by blizzards……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Aah, I truly am worried. I fear that wolves may appear abruptly and tear off her pitiful limbs. And who knows when villanous mountain thieves would appear and violate her body as they please. That’s so. For example, if I were to give a small signal.”</p><p>I snapped my fingers.</p><p>“There’s a possibility that a certain magic signal would be sent and a calamity would fall upon that girl’s frail body. Like a small cry would cause a massive avalanche. Chief, do not worry so much. It is fine to not look at me with such fearful eyes! I am simply pointing out the possibilities.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok’s body was trembling immensely.</p><p>It should be fine to stop treating him with this unamusing half-respect.</p><p>I changed my sarcastic tone to a clearly threatening tone.</p><p>“Oh pitiful vampire. Did you rage at the thought that Lapis Lazuli had betrayed you? ‘Let’s trample over this child who had dared to show her fangs to me’. Did you make that sort of decision? Aah, Lodbrok. You poor friend.”</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>“You had firmly guessed wrong. You were mistaken. Lapis Lazuli did not hunt me. Of course, she is a very admirable child, but is she capable of planning this kind of magnificent comedy……?”</p><p>I hunted her.</p><p>I kindly whispered in Ivar Lodbrok’s ear.</p><p>“From the beginning to the end, it was all your foolish misunderstanding. Lapis Lazuli had sworn her loyalty to you. But since she is a clever child, she knew full well that if she were to return to the firm, then under false accusation she would be purged. If the true miserable person was not that girl, then I didn’t know who was. Because of a single bastard bat, who lived their life thinking that they were a genius, she has fallen to being an exile.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok’s trembling became more violent.</p><p>I softly placed my hand on the other party’s shoulder.</p><p>“Thanks to you for making the wrong assumption, I was able to go through less trouble. Lapis Lazuli is a splendid child. I give you my thanks.”</p><p>“What does…… what does your highness want from this one……?”</p><p>“Oh. I simply want a slight bit of kindness.”</p><p>I gripped Ivar Lodbrok’s shoulder tightly.</p><p>“I truly did not release something like this Black Death. All you have to do is testify the truth. That is all.”</p><p>Do not present proof that would help make Paimon’s statement more persuasive.</p><p>It was a threat containing that meaning.</p><p>“Well……of course, you will also move around occasionally as my puppet. A price follows defeat, after all. Chief. I am an honest person. I will not place hypocritical words between us, like telling you nice things such as reassuring you that there will be no more misfortune from now on, and that it was fine to relax. Do you not think that hypocrisy is a discourtesy to others?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Many things will change.”</p><p>From the inside of your bones.</p><p>“I will give you many proposals that you cannot refuse, and you, in reality, will not be able to turn any of them down. You may occasionally have a sense of shame that you didn’t feel like a person, but like a beast trapped in a pig pen.”</p><p>Climbing up your spine.</p><p>“Occasionally you will display a rebellious spirit and resist against me. Shall I tell you how I will respond beforehand? Ah, I will not kill you. Really. I won’t even hit you. You can have my word. What I will do……”</p><p>To your skull.</p><p>“Is pluck the hair from your real body.”</p><p>Everything will be subjected to me.</p><p>“I will not take a lot. Every time you resist, I will only pluck a single strand of hair. Pluck, like that. Just playfully. That is all. How is that? Were you able to feel how generous of a person I was?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“While appreciating your beautiful face. Pluck, pluck, pluck, pluck…… pluck.”</p><p>With a ‘hoo’ I blew into his ear.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok shuddered like an aspen leaf.</p><p>This was why I couldn’t stop my enjoyment of threatening others.</p><p>“Hmm. I’m already looking forward to the day that you rebel against me. I can’t wait. But, I will endure it. I will gladly endure it. I have great patience, after all. You can feel relieved in that regard.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok clenched his teeth.</p><p>“This one…… will swear loyalty to no one.”</p><p>“Even better.”</p><p>I patted Ivar Lodbrok’s shoulder lightly.</p><p>“Use this opportunity to learn.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“People have to keep learning even if they’re old, you know. If one becomes lazy with their education then before they know it they’d have turned into a failure. A person must care and treasure their own body. Don’t you think so as well?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ivar Lodbrok could not respond.</p><p>If it was this much, then I believed that my sincerity was able to overcome the language barrier placed between us. Communication was this difficult. For me to have to resort to threats in order to make other people respect me, was that not tragic? When Oedipus had stabbed his own eyes, he was probably not as sad as I was now.</p><p>I straightened my back.</p><p>Then, I turned to look at the judge, Marbas.</p><p>“Oh, honorable Marbas. Our conversation is over. There will be no objections from myself if you are to continue the procedures of the hearing.”</p><p>“Good. Paimon, you can now prove the authenticity of your accusation.”</p><p>The hearing resumed.</p><p>Paimon, with a confident voice, called for Ivar Lodbrok.</p><p>“I understand. Lodbrok, please show the evidence.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Lodbrok?”</p><p>A frightening silence continued.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok had not lifted his head since awhile back. Paimon had called his name several times, but he remained unresponsive. Because of the unexpected silence, a panicked complexion had appeared on Paimon’s face. As the silence continued, her perplexed state had slowly spread to the people around her, until eventually, the entire ballroom was enshrouded by a peculiar silence.</p><p>At last, Ivar Lodbrok opened his mouth.</p><p>“…… her highness Paimon’s statement, is a lie.”</p><p>It was quiet.</p><p>It was incredibly quiet.</p><p>The hall was not calm because everyone had understood Ivar Lodbrok’s comment. It was the complete opposite. It was because not a single person had understood what Ivar Lodbrok had said, so there was no response.</p><p>“What did you say—”</p><p>Therefore, the first words to come out were not of understanding but was a question instead.</p><p>“Just now, what did you say?”</p><p>“This one. Had said that this one cannot submit the evidence that her highness Paimon had requested.” (TL note: He’s pausing for a second.)</p><p>“What are you trying to say…… have you gone mad, Lodbrok!”</p><p>Paimon let out a roar.</p><p>The silence that had fallen on top of the ballroom quickly shattered. Like a rising tide suddenly turning into a tsunami on a calm beach, Paimon’s limitless rage came pouring out. The pride she had on her face had already long ago been washed away by the tides.</p><p>“You had told this lady! That Dantalian was the culprit to abet the plague, and that that girl named Lapis Lazuli was the one to have spread the Black Death! Are you trying to ridicule this lady with that petty tongue!?”</p><p>“……My apologies. This one is unable to understand what your highness Paimon is talking about. Has it not been 10 years since we had last met each other in person like this?”</p><p>How beautiful.</p><p>With a smooth smile, I watched their quarrel.</p><p>There was something about witnessing people continuously shift the responsibility to one another that moved me deeply. Ah, I really shouldn’t live with other people. Ah, shutting myself away and spending the rest of my days in the corner of my room was truly the right way to live. It reminded me of these sort of life lessons.</p><p>You’re watching this too, are you not, Lapis Lazuli. I had promised you that I would show you the greatest circus performance in the world. On one side was the rank 9 high noble Demon Lord, and on the other side was the richest person in the demon world. And yet, the point that these two had reached was childishly tossing the responsibility to one another.</p><p>For you, who lived your life being treated unfairly because you were an outcast, I considered this to be the greatest stage performance just for you. Enjoy it at your leisure. Since I had specially directed and managed this performance for free. Despite how I looked, if I splurged for my subordinates, then I was a superior that did so extravagantly. It was fine to be moved.</p><p>“That is obvious since you had made contact with me using your subordinate!”</p><p>“This one is incapable of knowing what Torukel had told your highness Paimon. Regardless, there is one thing that this one does know. Evidence that his highness Dantalian had any personal involvement with the spreading of the disease is currently not in this one’s possession.”</p><p>“This, inferior and cowardly bat……!”</p><p>Paimon’s pretty face had contorted. As much as she was a beauty that appeared as if she was a piece of art, her enraged image was more terrifying.</p><p>“So be it then. You shall repay blood with blood! That is your Keuncuska Firm’s maxim, is it not! This lady shall very much keep that vow……!”</p><p>A blood-like aura began to seep out from Paimon’s body.</p><p>The concentration of magical energy was so thick that it was possible to see the shape and color of her aura. The fluctuation of the energy looked as if dozens of red tongues were waving intensely.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Paimon was not simply a Demon Lord, she was someone who had also gained the title of archmage.</p><p>Among the Demon Lords that consisted of 71 people, it was a feat that was only achieved by 4 individuals, and she was part of that 4.</p><p>“I shall act on behalf of vengeance!”</p><p>Paimon had shouted her dictum.</p><p>A dictum, in this world, was something that was passed down throughout history in each area of influential power. These were sacred vows that dictated that one would utilize everything, even one’s own life, in order to keep one’s pledge. Paimon was seriously intending to kill Ivar Lodbrok.</p><p>It was then that Marbas had stomped his right foot down.</p><p>Thud</p><p>The entire ballroom had shaken.</p><p>People stumbled as if they had been caught up in a small earthquake.</p><p>Marbas, with a menacingly cold air around him, glared at Paimon.</p><p>“—Cease your offensive actions immediately.”</p><p>Paimon made a pained expression.</p><p>“But, Marbas!”</p><p>“I said to stop this instant. You should be vigilant of forcing me to recite my dictum as well, Paimon. You are the person who requested for a last chance. Just to make myself clear, to me, one’s last chance means their ultimatum.”</p><p>“Euh……!”</p><p>Paimon clenched her teeth strongly.</p><p>Her magical energy did not die down, but it had started to rise more intensively.</p><p>“Just now, the chief executive from Keuncuska had toyed with this lady! Despite the fact that that chief had ordered his subordinate, Torukel, to show evidence to this lady, he was now trying to back down! This lady shall immediately execute that betrayer!”</p><p>“No matter who it is!”</p><p>Marbas roared out.</p><p>“Even if Baal were to come here, you cannot shed blood during the Walpurgis Night! You will preserve absolute neutrality while you are here! Unless you wish to turn myself and all the Demon Lords of the neutral faction, including 30,000 elite troops, into your enemy, then go ahead and try shedding blood here, Paimon! I will vow that on that day, the mountain faction, which you lead will be annihilated, and the land of the Demon Lords who are part of your faction will be cursed for 300 years, preventing even a single blade of grass from growing!”</p><p>An angry voice like a thunderstorm swept over the ballroom.</p><p>The candles which were floating in mid-air shook violently. Light and darkness fell upon people while being mixed up chaotically, the pillars of the building let off dust as it trembled.</p><p>People shrunk back. They were being overwhelmed by Marbas’ force.</p><p>Among the over 30 Demon Lords present here, the amount of people who were able to keep their backs straight were very few. At best, Barbatos was the only one to be nonchalantly sipping wine.</p><p>“Geezer—. If needed, us plains faction will provide you assistance whenever you want as well. Honestly, don’t you feel a bit apprehensive to go to war with only the neutral faction on your side? You and I could make a nice alliance.”</p><p>“Shut your mouth, Barbatos. I am not in the mood to jest.”</p><p>“I was just expressing my goodwill.”</p><p>Barbatos snickered.</p><p>Different to her, Paimon’s expression could only be explained as nothing but horrendous. From her lips, heated breaths were coming out like a cocktail of rage and self-control.</p><p>“Torukel……!”</p><p>Paimon chewed on her own words.</p><p>“He’s the messenger that passed on the orders from Ivar Lodbrok! He is standing by outside the venue right now. I shall summon him this instant and prove that Ivar Lodbrok has ridiculed this lady!”</p><p>A brief moment of chilling silence drifted through the venue.</p><p>Marbas took off his monocle and stared hard at Paimon.</p><p>“Are you certain?”</p><p>“This lady is only making accusation following truth.”</p><p>“…… You are taking my final faith.”</p><p>Marbas raised his chin up.</p><p>“Send in the witness known as Torukel!”</p><p>The faeries, having received the order, busily made their way out of the ballroom.</p><p>Aah.</p><p>I was submerged in sadness.</p><p>Think more calmly, Paimon. Whoever this Torukel was, he was still nothing more than a messenger. You can’t hope to get a proper testimony from that kind of person.</p><p>I understand that you respect every race including humans. To you, this Black Death would be a nightmare among nightmares. You most likely partook in this gathering while being resolute in finding the culprit to have cause such a tragedy. But the person that you thought to be your comrade, Ivar Lodbrok, had unexpectedly betrayed you. That’s why it was reasonable for you to be up to your head with anger. Despite that, you had to look ahead. Rage was always a shortcut to ruin.</p><p>Shortly after, an aged goblin entered the ballroom.</p><p>Paimon pointed at the goblin.</p><p>“Yes. That person is Torukel!”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>She started her questioning with a voice still carrying anger.</p><p>“Torukel. You’ll be our witness. You, under the orders of Ivar Lodbrok, had acted the role of messenger. Is that correct?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Torukel slowly looked around the room.</p><p>The goblin was supporting his body with a cane. There may have been many wrinkles on his forehead, but his eyes shone with intellect. I got the strong impression that he was not old, but he had simply lived for a long period of time.</p><p>The goblin looked at Ivar Lodbrok for a short moment and nodded. No words were exchanged between them.</p><p>Torukel carefully opened his lips.</p><p>“……It is an honor to be allowed in the presence of all these lords of demons. Keruk. This one, without a doubt, is an executive from the Keuncuska Firm, and am also of close relations with Ivar Lodbrok.”</p><p>As soon as Torukel readily revealed his own identity, Paimon’s face shone with delight. She most likely thought that she had seized victory. Like a machine gun, she started her questioning quickly.</p><p>“This lady shall get straight to the point, Torukel. You had told this lady that Dantalian had aided the spreading of the plague and that using some unknown means, he had a hand in the creation of the Black Death. Is this lady correct?”</p><p>“Yes. Of course, your highness.”</p><p>The audience started to stir once more.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok shut his eyes tightly as if he was distressed. On the other hand, Paimon, with a triumphant air, smiled widely. It was the figure of an individual who had overcome ridicule and painstakingly materialized justice.</p><p>However.</p><p>“What her highness has said is correct. I had most certainly claimed that Dantalian was the criminal behind the Black Death. However, that was a downright lie. It was slander without any evidence.”</p><p>“What……?”</p><p>It didn’t even take 10 seconds for the shock to solidify Paimon’s smile.</p><p>Torukel spoke flatly.</p><p>“This one had desired for the black herbs that were in the possession of his highness Dantalian. Of course, it would be impossible for this one, alone, to extort the personal effects of his highness Dantalian. However, this one was in the possession of two great sponsors. Her highness Paimon and the chief of executives, Ivar Lodbrok. Perhaps if this one were to use these two individual’s names, then it would be possible to get through the impasse. That was what I had thought.”</p><p>“Torukel…… just, what are you saying……”</p><p>Paimon opened her mouth.</p><p>It was a face of utter disbelief.</p><p>Torukel, using his cane to support himself, bowed deeply.</p><p>“My apologies. This one knew full well of your highness’ care for all the people on the continent. This one had used your highness’ merciful heart in order to incite hatred towards his highness Dantalian. His highness Dantalian was merely rank 71st anyway. This one had judged that once the hearing was open that it would end on the majority vote.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“As it so had happened, his highness Dantalian had murdered his highness Andromalius and this one had seen that as a golden opportunity. To threaten his highness Dantalian with the atrocious crime of murdering a Demon Lord. Using that chance, this one had planned to snatch away all of the black herbs. But his highness Dantalian had surpassed this one’s expectations and was able to prove his innocence. How vexing……”</p><p>Torukel glanced at me slightly.</p><p>I gazed back at him with absolutely no emotions on my face.</p><p>Unintentionally, with a ‘tsk’, I ended up clicking my tongue. I could grasp what that aged merchant was basically trying to do. He was intending to foil this great circus performance.</p><p>The judge, Marbas, sharply inquired Torukel.</p><p>“Small goblin. You have admitted yourself that you had ridiculed Paimon in order to fulfill your own selfish desires. Do you understand your crimes?”</p><p>“Yes, your highness. This one knows when to admit defeat. This one had tried to gain great profit by using her highness Paimon and the chief executive of the Keuncuska Firm. And I had failed. That is all.”</p><p>The goblin shook his head.</p><p>“If there was something wrong that her highness Paimon had done, then it was having trusted this wicked and old goblin. Thus, since all faults completely lies on this one— although from a humble birth.”</p><p>Quickly.</p><p>Before anyone could do anything.</p><p>Torukel took a small blade out from his clothes—</p><p>“This one shall apologize with this insignificant life.”</p><p>—and stabbed his own throat.</p><p>Ο</p><p>▯Keuncuska Executive, Miser Goblin, Torukel Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 8, Day 20 Niflheim, Governor’s Palace We had failed.</p><p>I knew this as soon as I had entered the ballroom.</p><p>Even if I didn’t want to, when her highness Paimon, who was supposed to be expressing kindness towards me, was staring at me with a terribly contorted face, I had no choice but to come to terms with it.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>…… I was prepared.</p><p>Merchants must always respect equal exchange.</p><p>Even if Demon Lord Dantalian was merely rank 71st, and even if Lapis Lazuli was merely an outcast half-breed, they too were lives that did whatever it took to stay alive.</p><p>A life for a life.</p><p>You had to put your own life on the line if you were to go after another.</p><p>Keruk.</p><p>It was a simple equation.</p><p>…… I dreamed for a world that was not controlled by hierarchy.</p><p>For merely being born as a Demon Lord you stood at the pinnacle of society. For being born between a demon and a human, you were treated like trash. That was the current state of the demon world. I wanted to change this……</p><p>Although some minute details were different, Ivar Lodbrok carried the same desire as myself. In this shabby world, Ivar and I were tied by camaraderie.</p><p>If one wished to change the world, then one needed money. That was why we had raised the Keuncuska Firm this far. Over the past hundreds of years, we had overcome an uncountable amount of hardship and adversity, and had barely reached the position of the greatest firm in the demon world……</p><p>Aaah.</p><p>I really did want to see it.</p><p>A bit more equal society.</p><p>I simply wanted to live in a place with less prejudice.</p><p>……I wanted to see a more beautiful world.</p><p>“Kuruk!”</p><p>I could feel the cold metal piercing my throat.</p><p>As one would expect, I could vividly feel the warm blood that was dripping down the blade.</p><p>Strength left my knees quickly. My body fell over slowly, and little by little it approached death. I could feel all this clearly.</p><p>Ivar. Take care of the rest.</p><p>I was unable to see the world change, but if it’s you, then you should be able to live till the very end. You are frighteningly cunning and intelligent after all.</p><p>Except, I worry that there may be no one who could understand your madness. Do not stay in solitude. One day you will find someone who will stay by your side once again……</p><p>And finally, I turned to look at Dantalian.</p><p>There was no special reason to this. My line of sight had simply moved to Dantalian coincidentally when I had fallen down. However, after looking at the face of the rank 71st Demon Lord, I opened my eyes wide.</p><p>“……!”</p><p>He was expressionless.</p><p>There was no bounds to how expressionless he was.</p><p>Despite having obtained a surprising victory tonight, there was not a single sign of Dantalian being delighted or overjoyed. It didn’t even seem like he was surprised by my suicide. As if it was obvious—he was staring down at me with eyes that appeared as if they understood completely why I had chosen to kill myself.</p><p>Was that it…… was that what it was……!</p><p>Seeing that expression, I immediately understood. Demon Lord Dantalian was not plain prey. Lapis Lazuli betraying our firm, and the murder of Andromalius, they were all schemes plotted by that man. It was not possible to know exactly what the plots were, but those eyes. Those eyes of a killer, surpassing logic, were more than enough to convince me. Dantalian was the puppeteer!</p><p>Aah, Ivar Lodbrok.</p><p>From beginning to end we were mistaken.</p><p>We had dived on top of a chessboard with no idea who our opponent was. Because of this, it was no wonder that we had lost so gruesomely. Have you realized, Ivar? Were you aware of the fact that that man was the true danger……</p><p>I wanted to open my mouth and warn Ivar. To please be careful of Dantalian.</p><p>But to my dismay, I did not have even a margin of energy left to move my lips. Rapidly. Life from my body dispersed silently. The vision in front of me faded to black.</p><p>I may have dreamed a beautiful dream, but I was unable to live a beautiful life. I have committed a fair amount of evil deeds. No doubt the Gods will drop me to Hell……</p><p>Ooh, merciful Proserpina.</p><p>Please show pity for this poor soul.</p><p>And then, I was enshrouded by eternal silence……</p><p>Ο</p><p>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 8, Day 20 Niflheim, Governor’s Palace The dagger easily pierced the neck of the old goblin.</p><p>The blade had impaled through his thin neck and stuck out from the other side.</p><p>The goblin’s small body collapsed to the floor with a thud.</p><p>A stillness fell over the room.</p><p>Red blood was flowing in the ballroom.</p><p>“Ah……?”</p><p>Paimon was.</p><p>“Ah……aah……?”</p><p>%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-1-page-423</p><p>Paimon was merely staring down at the goblin’s corpse.</p><p>That goblin was a merchant that Paimon had trusted without an ounce of doubt. It was clear that for a long time, a very long time, these two had known each other.</p><p>I wonder if her knees had given out, but Paimon had sunk to the floor. The blood flowing out from the goblin’s neck formed a puddle and the end of Paimon’s skirt became drenched with that blood.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Aah……ah, aaah……”</p><p>Like a broken record, she let out short moans repetitively.</p><p>It was a conclusion that she couldn’t have possibly predicted to have happened 30 minutes ago. Paimon may have only been moaning, but I distinctively understood the emotions that were grasping onto her heart.</p><p>That was why I had warned her.</p><p>To not cross the Rubicon River and reconcile with a glass of wine instead. But, without being able to realize anything, Paimon had raised a poisoned chalice. This was probably what a tragedy was.</p><p>I muttered in a voice that only I could hear.</p><p>“Spoiled the mood……”</p><p>You have really caused quite the chaos, you goblin bastard.</p><p>Originally, I was planning to direct a comedy. Ivar Lodbrok and Paimon were to blame each other. They would behave disgracefully and keep tossing the responsibility to the other person until the conference was over.</p><p>In the end, one side would eventually have their honor damaged and fall. That was the scenario I had written. People would have sent unreserved applause to the circus performance of a lion and a tiger fighting each other. However, this old goblin was a variable that I could not have possibly expected……</p><p>Torukel had bore all the mistakes of Ivar Lodbrok and Paimon on his own, and had brought them down with him. Paimon’s misunderstanding was because of Torukel’s trickery, and Ivar Lodbrok’s excuse was because of Torukel’s cajolement.</p><p>The two as victims. The one as the assailant. Except, no words could come from a corpse. The day that the truth was finally revealed will never come to be.</p><p>I sincerely give you my respect for that resolution of yours, goblin.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok and Paimon had gone against me with a clumsy mindset. They did not risk their lives. But you were different. You came at me with all you had. Unlike those two, you did not forget about proper etiquette.</p><p>That was splendid.</p><p>I must admit. People like you were more than qualified to interfere with my comfortable life.</p><p>“—We shall proceed with the show of hands for the hearing.”</p><p>Marbas spoke.</p><p>The only witness had killed himself and Paimon had lost her will. He must have judged that there was no point in continuing the hearing any further.</p><p>“The first issue is the murder case. The case where rank 72nd, Nameless Demon Lord Andromalius was murdered by rank 71st, Nameless Demon Lord Dantalian. The accuser has demanded 100,000 libra as compensation for the murder of Andromalius from Dantalian, and for Dantalian himself to be locked away in the Frozen Prison for 15 years.”</p><p>Marbas looked around the venue.</p><p>“Those who think Dantalian is guilty raise your right hand, the people who think he is innocent raise your left hand, and the people who are abstaining do not move your hands. The two people who are directly involved, and myself who has taken the role as the mediator, will not have the rights to vote.”</p><p>People promptly moved their arms after Marbas had finished explaining.</p><p>Among the 29 Demon Lords, the ones to have voted guilty were 9 people.</p><p>The people to have voted innocent was 19.</p><p>Marbas nodded.</p><p>“I declare that Dantalian is innocent in regards to the first matter.”</p><p>Excluding Paimon’s followers, nearly every Demon Lord had voted innocent. In truth, it was an overwhelming victory. And yet, the aftertaste was still bitter. It was because of that old goblin’s noble sacrifice. I didn’t feel as excited as I was before……</p><p>“The second issue is about the Black Death. The accuser had claimed that Dantalian was the true culprit to have spread the plague. Those of you who think this is true, raise your left hand, those who think it is false, your right hand.”</p><p>The people to have voted guilty were the same 9 individuals.</p><p>The people to have voted innocent was 15 individuals.</p><p>“Since it has surpassed the majority, I declare that Dantalian is innocent in regards to the second matter. Thus, on the name of rank 5th, the Demon Lord in charge of nobleness, I, Marbas, guarantee that you, Dantalian, are free from all charges. Those of you who have any objections to this verdict must keep in mind that you’ll be challenging my honor.”</p><p>Applause erupted from one of the Demon Lords. It was Barbatos this time as well. She was even whistling as she celebrated the verdict.</p><p>“Hahaha! Serves you right, whore! Ever since you started raising your nose thinking you were all high and mighty, I was looking forward to seeing that nose of yours get crushed! Seeing as it has come to this, why not spend some ‘time(屍姦)’ with that goblin! You two will probably be a perfect match in bed!” (TL note: ‘time’ is a play on words here. It can be read as “shi-gan” in Korean, which means the passage of time, but here it is using a Chinese word that is pronounced the same but with a different meaning. It basically means ‘necrophilia’.)</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>……Although the direction of the celebration was horrendously vulgar.</p><p>Right now Paimon, with unfocused eyes, was staring down vacantly at Torukel’s corpse. To be able to openly laugh at a woman in that state, those weren’t normal nerves, but was immense brutality instead. It was impressive in another meaning. I gained the certainty that if I wanted to maintain a peaceful life, then it would be a good idea to not get involved with Barbatos.</p><p>Her chest was also flat.</p><p>Her chest was as flat as the Siberian fields—</p><p>It was important so I emphasized it twice.</p><p>If you were a logical person with refinement then it was obvious to prefer matureness over immatureness, abundance over lacking. Lolita complex is a mental illness, everyone. I hope you are able to go to your nearest mental hospital and get a suicide check-up.</p><p>“Now, we shall discuss Paimon’s punishment. Dantalian. Despite your innocence, Paimon had tried to accuse you. One must pay the price for failure. Suggest what you think would be the most fitting level of punishment.”</p><p>“A penalty, huh……”</p><p>I looked down at the floor.</p><p>In the past, court controversy had a meaning similar to that of a duel. Putting their honor on the line, both sides fought over what was guilty and innocent. If the accuser were to lose, then they would receive the very sentencing that they had declared for the other party. It meant that if you wanted to curse another, then you had to dig your own grave first. It was a tough legacy from the medieval period.</p><p>In this situation, Paimon would have to pay the 100,000 gold fine and be confined for 15 years in prison. Once again, I understood what kind of harsh resolve Paimon was carrying while stepping forward in the hearing. Was that so. It may not have been as much as the goblin, but Paimon had as well, in her own way, prepared to take responsibility……</p><p>Then, all of a sudden a choice box appeared before me.</p><p>Ο</p><p>[1. Forgive Paimon.]</p><p>[2. Reprimand Paimon.]</p><p>Ο</p><p>Seeing this choice box appear, it meant that this was a crucial decision.</p><p>Similar to having chosen to murder Andromalius, this was something that would greatly change the direction of the world.</p><p>Marbas pressed me with a low voice.</p><p>“Dantalian.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>I glanced at the goblin’s corpse.</p><p>Torukel. You did not leave a will. But what you wanted to say was conveyed clearly. No matter what, to not let Ivar Lodbrok or Paimon be troubled. Those were most likely the dying words that you could not spill out from your own mouth. The part of life that was so-called sorrow.</p><p>As a means to express my condolence to you, those dying words of yours, I shall respect it.</p><p>“It is fine.”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“I said it is fine, honorable Marbas.”</p><p>I raised my head and faced Marbas.</p><p>I had a weak smile on my lips. It was in order to display a tired expression. Well, it had also been a long time since I had last used my brain this much, so I was actually a bit tired.</p><p>“Even if I was under false accusation and slandered, her highness Paimon was also in the sorry position of having been swept up in a plot, was she not? As it has already been proven to everyone here, the true culprit behind all these incidents was that goblin on the floor over there. He was a peerless villain. However, since he is dead, there is no reason to make someone else take responsibility.”</p><p>“In other words…… are you saying that you will not demand any punishment?”</p><p>“Yes, your honor. As the person directly involved in the hearing, and as the person to have survived the court of law by obtaining victory, with my just rights I shall request of this. Rank 71st, Nameless Demon Lord Dantalian hereby requests, for her highness Paimon to not be punished in any way because of this incident.”</p><p>I grinned.</p><p>“In the first place, this is the sacred Walpurgis Night. This is not a location for such vulgar words like punishment or penalty to be tossed around.”</p><p>The people around me made a commotion. They probably didn’t imagine that the very person to be accused would come out so pleasantly. They all had the same expression of surprise. On the contrary, once I had watched the goblin kill himself, I couldn’t have been more calm.</p><p>I did not want to become a person who went around talking about ‘acknowledgement’ and ‘respect’ all the time. I had thought to acknowledge Torukel the goblin. I had decided to respect his will. Then I must show it by actions.</p><p>To forgive Paimon here was, with no doubt, a politically dangerous decision. In the political world, just by the mere fact that you were enemies one could continue to take hostile actions. Today, disregarding the truth, the relationship between Paimon and I had clearly become ‘enemies’. To change this relationship into a different form will probably take a considerable amount of tiresome work.

The only thing that this one wants tonight is a single warm glass of honey wine.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>[1. Forgive Paimon.]</p><p>[2. Reprimand Paimon.]</p><p>Ο</p><p>As soon as I had finished talking, the choice box melted away.</p><p>Soon, the choice box was replaced by new lines.</p><p>Each individual letter was dismantled and put together to form new words. It gave the subtle pleasure like watching lego bricks being assembled on their own.</p><p>Ο</p><p>[A kind and merciful decision!]</p><p>[The continent is impressed by your magnanimity.]</p><p>[Fame increased substantially.]</p><p>Ο</p><p>The sentences glowed brightly in mid-air.</p><p>The words broke apart into sparkling particles. Then shortly after, after drifting through the air like a bunch of petals, they silently vanished off to somewhere.</p><p>“……”</p><p>Marbas was staring at me. His blue eyes would make one think of a serene ocean. I did not avoid Marbas and calmly met his gaze.</p><p>“To think of duty over resentment. In words, it sounds easy, but words have the tendency of becoming harder to adhere if they are shorter, and becoming easier to keep if they are longer. It is not something that anyone can do. Additionally, the amount of people to turn down the opportunity to lawfully vent one’s spite is a precious few.”</p><p>Marbas patted my shoulder. His trust was transmitted through his hand.</p><p>“You are remarkable, Dantalian. As the host of this Walpurgis Night, I’d like to give you my thanks. I look forward to the day that you are able to be rid of your Nameless Demon Lord status and become a monarch possessing a grand title.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>[Demon Lord Marbas’ affection went up by 9.]</p><p>Ο</p><p>Instead of responding with words, I lowered my head.</p><p>Marbas had said that he did not trust long talks earlier. So to go beyond short words and respond with silence was appropriate to go along with Marbas’ beliefs. Marbas seemed to have understood my intent. He nodded and patted my shoulder once more.</p><p>“……However, even if there is to be no official punishment, it would be irrational to not have even one word of apology. Paimon.”</p><p>Marbas turned around to look at Paimon. She was still sitting in a daze at the side of the goblin’s body. She was like a doll that had all her strings cut. Marbas spoke to her with a pained face.</p><p>“Apologize to Dantalian here.”</p><p>Paimon flinched.</p><p>“……Apol, igize……?”</p><p>“Yes. That is the responsibility that you must carry.”</p><p>“Lied…… Torukel…… lie, d”</p><p>Paimon moved her body to get up, but failed. There was no strength in her knees, so she had simply slipped back down. Paimon lifted her head barely to look at me.</p><p>“Did Torukel…… betray, this lady?”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“That is so. Your highness.”</p><p>“Innocent……?”</p><p>“Yes. I did not create the Black Death. I did not purposely spread it either. That was all a hoax created by that merchant, Torukel.”</p><p>Paimon slowly lowered her head. There was a moment of silence. I had no methods to know what she was thinking. Shortly after, with trembling shoulders, she muttered in a very small voice.</p><p>“……I……ry……”</p><p>At first, we couldn’t understand what she had said. Like a broken radio, her words would come out then stop and then rewind to start again. This repeated. The sound of crying was mixed in like static. However, Paimon repeated the same words over and over again, until eventually we could hear her loud and clear.</p><p>“I’m…… so, rry……”</p><p>They were words of apology.</p><p>A pool of blood had formed on the ground which Paimon had fallen to. Something was falling there. They were Paimon’s tears. Each time a tear collided against the crimson puddle, like a pebble falling into a lake, gentle waves in the shape of rings would spread out.</p><p>“I’m sorry……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“I’m sorry…… I’m sorry……”</p><p>A peculiar silence swept over the ballroom.</p><p>Paimon’s voice was most certainly small, but it felt like her words could be heard by everyone here.</p><p>It must have been hard to keep watching. A female Demon Lord, who I assumed was one of Paimon’s followers, rushed out and started to support the frail woman. Paimon was weakly dragged outside by the female Demon Lord. A group of around 15 people followed that female Demon Lord out of the ballroom. No one tried to stop them.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“There were many complications, but.”</p><p>Wanting to change the topic, Marbas spoke.</p><p>“It does not change the fact that today is still the Walpurgis Night. Although there are still some agendas remaining, we can push that to tomorrow. I shall be taking up Barbatos’ suggestion and offer a place to drink to everyone here.”</p><p>With a ‘clap‘, Marbas brought his hands together.</p><p>At once, faeries came in and began to serve all kinds of food and beverages. Elves wearing maid uniforms and tailcoats entered the room carrying chairs and tables. The ballroom had instantly changed into a banquet hall. I also had the honor of being poured a glass of honey wine from Marbas directly.</p><p>People of power were rare. People of power with common sense were even more rare, to the point that they should be announced as a near extinct species and rated EX on the charts. I, with the desire to preserve nature’s rare species, accepted the glass politely.</p><p>Ο</p><p>For the rest of the day, there was no occasion of Paimon showing her face again.</p><p>Ο</p><p>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 8, Day 21 Niflheim, Governor’s Palace The banquet did not end even past midnight.</p><p>I had never imagined that Demon Lords would be such heavy drinkers. Barbatos was especially amazing. She picked up an entire jug of alcohol and chugged it down in one go.</p><p>People cheered and applauded. It was insane. Also, Barbatos seemed to have taken a liking to me cause she kept forcing me to drink. If I tried to refuse slightly then she’d say, “Aaang? Are you trying to resist drinking the alcohol that I’m bestowing to you?” and got heated up. Was this not a barbaric person, or what?</p><p>Not being able to socialize with her any longer, I secretly withdrew to the hallway. Truthfully, I wanted to escape out the front gate, but there was the chance that I’d get caught by Barbatos.</p><p>Her outer appearance was that of a little girl but where was that tremendous amount of alcohol being consumed to? I couldn’t understand. In my opinion, I thought that scientist needed to go through her stomach as soon as possible. I was certain that a miniature black hole was in there…… The problem was that the science in this world was not advanced. As a result, it was impossible to find out. It was an unsolvable mystery……</p><p>My mind felt blank. I must have gotten drunk. I was walking through an empty hallway, and yet, everything in front of me felt like it was pulsating. Damn it. It was because that kid, born on the plains of Siberia, said “I’ll show you my hidden treasure.” and forced me to drink a concoction of 6 different alcohols. What did she mean by “Think of this as an honor. Not just anyone can taste this.”? Go drink yourself to death……</p><p>I could hear quiet footsteps behind me. Turning around, I saw that Lapis Lazuli was standing there. I courteously opened my arms.</p><p>“Ooh, Lala! My Lala! Your eyes are like azure and your voice is like a hymn sung in harmony!”</p><p>Ehem.</p><p>In actuality, I had spread my arms out in a bit of an exaggerated manner.</p><p>What? I’m drunk. It was beyond my control.</p><p>“…… Your highness moved too rashly.”</p><p>“What? I’m so great that you’ve fallen for me?”</p><p>“This one said that your highness has moved too rashly.”</p><p>“To the point that you want to smooch me? That’s great! If you knew how hard I worked to gain your affection, then you’d feel so sorry for me that you’d willingly offer me your lips.”</p><p>“Your highness.”</p><p>I shut my mouth.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli’s gaze pierced right through me.</p><p>“Your highness is reckless, irresponsible, and rash.”</p><p>“…… Are you not deeply moved by my victory?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“That’s a bit of a shock.”</p><p>It was as shocking as the time I had received a confession from a boy in the same class as me during elementary school.</p><p>“Paimon is not only the rank 9th Demon Lord, but she is also the leader of the mountain faction that is known as the greatest faction in the Demon Lord Allied Forces. She is in command of many loyal followers and has a close relationship to people in power on the human side. In simpler terms, your highness has turned one of the most important figures of the Demon World into an enemy.”</p><p>“Wait. Wait a second, Lala.”</p><p>I waved my hands fiercely.</p><p>“……I am not reckless, I am not irresponsible, and I am not rash. These are words I’m hearing for the first time in my life. That’s incredibly insulting.”</p><p>“Is that so? What kind of plan is it that your highness had to turn the richest man and the leader of the greatest faction in the demon world, into enemies?”</p><p>“That…… that is……”</p><p>It was no use.</p><p>My mind was still intoxicated by alcohol so I couldn’t think straight. It wasn’t an unsophisticated scenario where I could simply talk about it while being drunk. This was like the most elaborate machinery in the world.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“That is, it’s tremendously……”</p><p>“Tremendously?”</p><p>“Amazing…… and frighteningly great…… that kind of plan!”</p><p>“Your highness possesses quite the impressive persuasive ability. This one was so moved that this one had become at a loss for words.”</p><p>“My eyes and ears could be failing me at the same time, but your tongue sure is moving a lot for being at a loss for words.”</p><p>“It is a relief that your highness has enough rationality to notice that.”</p><p>“Ooh!”</p><p>Like a dreadful actor, I shouted up at the ceiling.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Lala! That’s right! I have gone completely mad! After being accused by Paimon and seeing that old bat laughing at me from the side, all my self-control ended up exploding! That’s why I showed them a lesson! I can not even begin to grasp how I could possibly repent for my tremendous mistake to our succubus lady!”</p><p>I turned my body around and bowed. It was the location completely opposite of where Lapis Lazuli was. Of course, there was no one there. Thanks to the moonlight coming in from the window, I could just barely make out the shape of the floor.</p><p>No, since I could see a bit there wasn’t absolutely no one there. A gray cat was perched on the window sill and licking its paw. I bowed deeper to the cat.</p><p>“I apologize, Paimon! I apologize, followers of Paimon and to the supporters of Ivar Lodbrok! I have refuted and crushed these people who you all so love very much! They accused me for a crime that I did not commit, they raised their nose high just because they had an authority as big as a finger nail in this large universe of ours, and they were individuals that didn’t know how to respect others, but everyone must have loved these two dearly anyway. Ooh, the Goddesses will rain their rage down upon me! Oh, Erbus, oh, Nemesis, the most terrifying Goddesses! If, perhaps, you are all up there in the sky—if you are doing nothing and looking down at me from your seats—”</p><p>I looked upwards like a prophet who was receiving commandments directly from God. My body moved seriously and my voice rang splendidly. I looked as if I was receiving the award for the best leading actor of the year.</p><p>“I may be too educated and overflowing with refinement to properly believe in Goddesses, so I can not say with certainty that you all do exist up in the sky, but, if by some astronomical chance, you all are really up there—Goddesses! Do not forgive this piece of trash Dantalian who has ridiculed the leader of the greatest faction and the richest person in the demon world and smite me!”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“However, if I were to speak subjectively—albeit, I do think that this subjective opinion of mine is objectively the truth and have no doubt about it, in any case, as much as I need to be a bit modest while in front of the Goddesses, I shall speak subjectively out of pure courtesy— If you agree with my personal opinion that Paimon and Ivar Lodbrok are both terribly unlucky and are both rotten pork tripe that are on the boundary of becoming unrecyclable— then you damned Goddesses! Please do nothing, do absolutely nothing, and allow me to live my life as I please! Since I am 1000 times more competent than some Goddesses that sit around and piss all day!”</p><p>……</p><p>Silence.</p><p>The gray cat was surprised and looking this way with wide opened eyes. The cat must have forgotten that it was grooming its own fur since its front paw had frozen in mid-air. It wasn’t strange. It had the honor of being a witness to my powerful and grandeur confession of faith, after all. It was like someone was resting at the backside of a mountain and then suddenly Moses came walking down from the mountain top. I could understand the feelings of a cat. That was how much understanding I was overflowing with.</p><p>“Hoo, uhoo……”</p><p>I settled my breathing.</p><p>Now the intoxication was dissipating.</p><p>I turned around and faced Lapis Lazuli. She was staring at me with her same as usual expressionless face. I lifted my index finger and pointed up towards the ceiling.</p><p>“Look at that. Nothing happened.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Thinking logically, we can derive three conclusions from this. First, the Goddesses has generously forgiven my reckless, irresponsible, and rash antics. Oh, Lala, you are indeed a very distinguished girl, and there is a chance that you’re more distinguished than I am— Of course, that is a topic of much debate— but clearly you are not as distinguished as the Goddesses. Thus, second, since the Goddesses have forgiven me, you must forgive me as well. That is what having a modest attitude means, after all. And finally, third, the Goddesses has admitted that Paimon and Ivar Lodbrok are similar to that of rotten pork tripe. Thus, the act of threatening them is theologically, juristically, and ethically not a problem. Now then. If you have anything to say against my absolutely perfect logic, then go ahead.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>A moment of stillness returned to the hallway.</p><p>We stared each other for a while.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli then opened her mouth.</p><p>“Is your highness done talking?”</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>“Does this one need to point out that your highness has used the beginning rhetorical technique of ‘using a false premise’?”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>“Is there a reason this one needs to remind your highness how politically dangerous it is to intensely declare in a public place of one’s militant atheism?”</p><p>“There are none.”</p><p>“How does your highness think this one should react to the lord who’s logically, politically and theologically guilty?”</p><p>“I do not think anything of it.”</p><p>“This one had thought so.”</p><p>“Lala. I truly am unable to explain it properly because I am still intoxicated, but I assure you that I have already planned out a perfect scheme that’ll put you at a lost for words. I’ll explain it to you after a short rest, and then even you will admire it. So for now, let us return to our room, lay on the bed, and discuss the rest……”</p><p>“This one knows.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“This one believes that your highness is devising a thorough plan.”</p><p>I blinked.</p><p>“That is, uh, what do I say……rather unexpected.”</p><p>“This one knows that your highness’ true nature is like that of a predator, a spider to be exact. Before taking one step, your highness looks forward 10 steps, and if there is no certainty of a perfect hunt, then your highness waits patiently. People may think your highness is a good-for-nothing deadbeat when they see your highness not move and they will laugh in ridicule for it, but in truth, your highness is simply waiting for your prey to get caught in the web for you.”</p><p>“……Thank you for the compliment?”</p><p>My head felt blank so I wasn’t very certain, but I think this was the first time Lapis Lazuli had ever praised me like this. Not knowing how to react in that moment, I creased my brows.</p><p>“Then why did you ill-treat me?”</p><p>“Since your highness’ mentality is so twisted, this one had judged that your highness required a vassal that would constantly be by your side and scold your highness.”</p><p>“Lala. I am a full grown adult. I do not have any reason whatsoever to get a new mother figure now and hear nagging……”</p><p>It was then.</p><p>Slowly.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli had casually grabbed my necktie.</p><p>In my short moment of confusion, Lapis Lazuli pulled.</p><p>I did not know exactly what kind of physical principle was hidden within this action, but the result was simple and obvious.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli had stolen my lips.</p><p>%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-1-page-425</p><p>“……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>I could feel something soft on my lips.</p><p>I wonder if about 10 seconds had passed. We steadily drifted apart.</p><p>When two people split apart, it would feel unnatural even if they were to share hundreds of idle talk, but in this moment of silence, it felt perfectly natural to drift away. Once the kiss was over and we had regained our distance, I felt that that distance felt incredibly natural.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli whispered.</p><p>“I also do not intend to act as your highness’ mother.”</p><p>“……Lala.”</p><p>I spoke carefully.</p><p>“I admit that over the period of time I have said many salacious lines like kissing. However, that was purely to enjoy watching your embarrassed reaction, and thus had no deeper meaning. If, by chance, I had planted a misunderstanding due to that, then I shall sincerely apologize here and……”</p><p>“I know that as well. Your highness.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli cut me off.</p><p>And once again, she pulled my necktie downwards.</p><p>“That’s why, please shut up.”</p><p>We buried ourselves under the dark hallway.</p><p>After the second kiss, who moved first, whose palm grasped the other’s body first, and who was the first to push the other into the darkest corner of the hallway, we could not tell. It had become meaningless to discuss the order.</p><p>The only thing I could remember vividly were her silently glowing blue eyes.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Meoow.</p><p>A gray cat meowed.</p><p>The cat bathed in the moonlight and stretched out tiredly.</p>"

      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><h4><strong>Prologue</strong></h4><p>Ο</p><p>Overcome your past.</p><p>People would say&nbsp;this easily.</p><p>If I were to give a piece of advice to these optimistic people, then it would be&nbsp;that there&nbsp;were a lot of past experiences in the world that could not be overcome.</p><p>What if your own mother was human trash?</p><p>That was fine. You&nbsp;could manage that.</p><p>Or if your own father was a guy like trash?</p><p>You&nbsp;could be patient up&nbsp;to that as well.</p><p>But,&nbsp;if you&nbsp;were to watch your younger half-siblings tremble in fear because your own mother had slapped them, solely for the reason that they were from another mother, and your&nbsp;father&nbsp;watched idly from the side while&nbsp;not uttering a single word—then at that point, you could only modestly accept the truth.</p><p>That your life was shoved into dog shit.</p><p>I had vaguely assumed that my life had reached this position when I was 10 years old.</p><p>My younger half-siblings were clinging onto each other and crying. The reason was simple. My mother had cursed at them by shouting, “You dirty children of a whore!”. Of course, at that time I didn’t know what the word ‘whore’ meant. The day&nbsp;I discovered that the existence of a penis could be used for something other than peeing was when I was 11, thus meaning, I needed to wait 1 more year before I stepped into the world of obscenity.</p><p>I’m serious.</p><p>Even I had a time when I was pure.</p><p>Back to the story.</p><p>There was no way a 6 and 5 year-old could comprehend&nbsp;the word ‘whore’, when&nbsp;a 10-year-old couldn’t either. Except, it was obvious that the words were said with an offensive nuance. How could I tell? That was because when my mother had called them whores.</p><p>“Oh my. So you two are the children of a whore.”</p><p>She did not speak pleasantly&nbsp;like this, but.</p><p>“These mongrel-like whore’s children. How dare you not know your place and—!”</p><p>She had exploded her anger out savagely.</p><p>Even children knew when they were not welcomed.</p><p>Regardless of being able to understand the words or not, you&nbsp;at least knew when the adult in front of you&nbsp;was trying to kill you or help you.&nbsp;It was especially noticeable&nbsp;when the adult had intensely&nbsp;slapped your face&nbsp;at the part of saying “children of a whore”.</p><p>Thus, the moment my younger half-siblings started trembling their shoulders.</p><p>The moment my younger siblings, who were laughing happily just a second ago, had muffled their crying because they were sincerely afraid that&nbsp;<strong>they were going to be killed,</strong></p><p>I had the gut feeling that if I did&nbsp;not fix this shitty situation, then my life too would become shit.</p><p>“Father. Throw out my mother.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Don’t needlessly ask back. You heard everything. Have a divorce with my mother.”</p><p>My father blinked.</p><p>Even his blinking felt like an excuse which further raised my annoyance towards him.</p><p>“……What are you saying?”</p><p>“So you’re going to keep backing out? That’s fine, I’ll use this opportunity to clearly say this now. My mother is insane. My little sisters had merely broken a ceramic cup by mistake, but do you know what my mother did?”</p><p>I slapped my own face. Hard.</p><p>Because I thought that I should show him a demonstration.</p><p>“She slapped them. Hard enough to make my siblings fall to the floor. Up to here you can still overlook&nbsp;her&nbsp;as a normal hysterical patient, but what she did next was the real problem. My mother went to get a kitchen knife and shoved it near my siblings’ faces.</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Do you understand? A kitchen knife. She showed a knife to my 5-year-old little sister. My mother is not a hysteria&nbsp;patient. She’s a through and through insane person. Divorce my mother immediately and kick her out of our home.”</p><p>“Son. She is still your mother.”</p><p>“I am fully aware.”</p><p>I spoke coldly.</p><p>“That’s why I’m urging&nbsp;you to divorce her even more. Before I further scorn the father who claimed to love that woman and made her his wife.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Father. You read to me quotes from Rousseau yesterday. That the difference between man and beasts was that they bore&nbsp;a will. You read this to me in a soft, a very soft tone. And today, I’ve discovered a beast within my mother’s face.”</p><p>“Certainly, it was effective giving you a teacher on rhetorics.&nbsp;Seeing that you’re a lot more eloquent than I was at your age.”</p><p>“I already realized that I was a genius when I was 6-years-old. You aren’t going to make me realize it again by complimenting me now.”</p><p>“Did you hear it as a compliment? I was scoffing.”</p><p>“Ha. You’re the one who needs to listen to the rhetorical classes, father. You don’t even know how to properly scoff at your own son and you think&nbsp;you’ll be able to hold onto your wife? Please do better at looking after yourself.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“I will say it again. She’s your mother.”</p><p>My father’s voice became cold.</p><p>“For 10 months, she went through all kinds of pain holding you inside of her stomach before giving birth to you. The very first person to smile when you came to this world was your mother, the first person to cry for you when you got hurt for the first time was also your mother. Son. Know your place. How dare you say such immoral words like kicking out your own mother.”</p><p>I snickered.</p><p>“How shameless.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“This is not my problem. This your problem, father. Because of a single mother, 6 of your children are being abused. It’s simple math. Will you save 1, or save the other 6. Throw away irritating words like immoral. There are no humans as ethically trash as you, father. None.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“This will be the last time that I will request something from you regarding this topic, father. For good. So give me a serious response. Will you divorce my mother?”</p><p>My father went silent.</p><p>He stayed&nbsp;silent for over 40 minutes.</p><p>The reason why I remembered the time exactly was because I had glared at the wristwatch my father had on. It was around the time 11am was crossing over to 12 in the afternoon.</p><div></div><p>“I can’t.”</p><p>Damn 12 in the afternoon.</p><p>Since that moment, I despised this time permanently. My habit of refusing to wake up in the morning originated from here too. I will be saying this again but. I utterly despised the morning and noon.</p><p>“……Why not?”</p><p>“Because I love your mother.”</p><p>“That is a really, immensely, disappointing answer. Then does that mean you do not love your children, father? Do you not care if your wife were to kill all of your children?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>And thus I could never&nbsp;forget this moment.</p><p>Like a sculptor using a hammer and nail to engrave a mark on my brain.</p><p>A type of trauma was embedded.</p><p>“I love your mother that much.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“I’m sorry, son.”</p><p>“……Just now, father.”</p><p>I gulped.</p><p>It might not have only been saliva that I had swallowed down.</p><p>“Father, you had just now lost all of my trust.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Father, you had just now ruined my life.”</p><p>“I know that as well.”</p><p>My father nodded.</p><p>“No matter what you choose, you will live a life more harsh than I.”</p><p>This damn father.</p><p>I truly detested you.</p><p>“……Let me ask one last thing. If this was a normal question…… You&nbsp;would obviously sacrifice 1 person for 6. That’s the kind of person you are, father. But, because of the thing so-called love, are you telling me that you’re choosing to select 1 over the 6?”</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>“If that love of yours, father, is only making you weak, then what is the point of love?”</p><p>My father did not answer.</p><p>It was because he could not answer.</p><p>I bit my lips and cursed.</p><p>“I feel ashamed to look at my own weak father. Do you understand? I am ashamed to death. In the end you could not choose anything, father. You really are that, that damn indecisive.”</p><p>At that time ‘damn’ was the highest level of curse that I knew.</p><p>I did not know how to use curses that were more terrible than that.</p><p>Did I not say so already?</p><p>Even I had a time when I was pure.</p><p>“Son.”</p><p>“Do not apologize. I’m not being upset at you in order to&nbsp;receive an apology. What could possibly change if you apologized. Just know this.”</p><p>I vowed.</p><p>A cold vow.</p><p>A clear vow.</p><p>“I will not become weak like you, father.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Ever.”</p><p>And.</p><p>And……</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/dunde2-021.jpg?w=700\"></p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day 20 Niflheim, Hermes’ Plaza</h4><p>Ο</p><p><em>Slap!</em></p><p>In truth, it was a jaunty sound.</p><p>The sound of skin and skin colliding echoed loudly.</p><p>People must have been alarmed by the sudden powerful shockwave because they had their mouths held agape.

This one had hoped that your highness would display something different compared to the other people intoxicated by authority. But all this one can see before her is an incredibly fattened swine.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I carefully felt my cheek.</p><p>It hurt.</p><p>My skin was red and swollen.</p><p>Was it not impressive?</p><p>“……Lapis Lazuli. While you are my mistress and fiancée, you are at the same time also my vassal. Midday, while in the center of the plaza, in front of hundreds of citizens, you have raised your hand at your lord. You know how much of a disloyal act this is, right?”</p><p>“Yes. This one knows.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>Be it an outcast or a half-breed, for someone like that to dare hit an inviolable Demon Lord. This alone was enough to reach top news of the year. Even the people in the plaza were looking at this&nbsp;with an astonished gaze.</p><p>But it was not over yet. Let me make it more enjoyable.</p><p>I decreed.</p><p>“I, Dantalian, hereby relieve you of your duties.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Do not appear before me again.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>On that day, a shocking news spread throughout the city.</p><p>The couple that had become the most famous in the demon world for having overcome social statuses had broken apart in 2 months.</p><p>If this wasn’t a splendid occasion, then I didn’t know what it was.</p><p>Ο</p><hr><p>TL Note: Well, I finished reading Volume 2 in a single day. I honestly expected it to take longer, but I got way too into it. My neck hurt so much yesterday while I was reading. Obviously I can’t go lie down somewhere at work to read a book. Neck cramps also lead to a severe headache so I thought I was dying.</p><p>Anyways, I decided to just translate immediately after I finished reading(a day after). So you guys are getting this a lot faster than I originally intended.</p><p>I should also note, volume 2 is really an emotional rollercoaster. Please don’t start hating characters until you’ve read up to the last chapter! Is that a spoiler? I don’t…… think it is?</p>"

You had a big fight with your succubus lover, right?”</p><p>“Rumors really do spread fast.”</p><p>“I’m a girl who’s a bit sensitive to trends.”</p><p>Barbatos had come to visit&nbsp;me at my lodging.</p><p>For some reason this distinguished Demon Lord, who was&nbsp;ranked 8th,&nbsp;had become fairly fond of me. She probably had a good&nbsp;impression towards&nbsp;me because of the incident where I had knocked Paimon off of her pedestal. Well,&nbsp;that wasn’t the only reason.</p><p>“Go ahead and let it all out. Why&nbsp;did you two fight?”</p><p>“Do you not see me applying ice&nbsp;still? It has&nbsp;only been 20 minutes since I was slapped by Lapis. Honestly, I don’t want to talk to anyone right now.”</p><p>“Oh, this poor male.”</p><p>Barbatos smiled slyly.</p><p>It was a bit annoying.</p><p>“Think carefully. Your lover&nbsp;is a half-breed succubus. She is an outcast who would normally get executed for merely touching a Demon Lord. If a child like that were to hit you, then she was doing so while literally putting her life on the line. What kind of misdeed could you have done to make her risk such a thing?”</p><p>“So are you saying that this&nbsp;is all&nbsp;my fault?”</p><p>“Yup. Throughout my entire life, whenever a problem occurs, males have always seemed to have a higher chance of being at fault than females.”</p><p>“You must be quite pleased to have been born as a female.”</p><p>Barbatos laughed.</p><p>Normally, we would not be&nbsp;in the position to be exchanging informal words so frankly.</p><p>Barbatos was the rank 8th Demon Lord. She had a standing army of 6,000 men&nbsp;and a countless number of followers under her command. She even led a huge political group&nbsp;known as the Plains Faction.</p><p>On the other hand, I&nbsp;was the rank 71st Demon Lord. Not only did I&nbsp;have no&nbsp;followers, but I was also not part of a proper faction either. I may have been overflowing with money, but that was all. Compared to Barbatos I was a mere fly.</p><p>Despite that, it felt like Barbatos vaguely wanted me to be her friend. What was&nbsp;I supposed to do when the other party wanted an easy-going style of speech&nbsp;from me first? I’ll more than gladly humor her.</p><p>“Dantalian. We may&nbsp;not be friends yet, but I believe that we have reached something similar to&nbsp;being friends.”</p><p>“That is quite the honor.”</p><p>“I’m being serious.”</p><p>Barbatos grinned.</p><p>That expression of hers was the reason why even if she told me that she was being serious, I felt&nbsp;no credibility&nbsp;from it.</p><p>“Most of the Demons Lords are a bunch of trash. None of them are promising. Yet, you’re the first rookie in 60 years to appear to be&nbsp;talented. I just wanted to treat you nicely as your senior in this business industry.”</p><p>A senior, huh.</p><p>Barbatos led the group known as the ‘Plains Faction’. This faction gained its&nbsp;name due to the fact that most of the Demon Lords who were in this group had castles that were located on the plains. As a result of residing&nbsp;in an open area, encounters with humans&nbsp;were frequent.</p><p>Thus, Barbatos naturally became a Demon Lord hostile towards humans. If the Demon Lord armies were to ever invade the human world, then Barbatos would, with&nbsp;no doubt, be the one to lead them. She&nbsp;had spread an information network across the human world and was constantly on watch as she prepared for a massive war.</p><p>On the other hand, Paimon, the Demon Lord that I had crushed, was known as the head of the ‘Mountain Faction’. As the name literally suggests, this faction consisted mostly of Demon Lords with castles located on the rugged mountain region, where&nbsp;they seldom met with humans face to face.</p><p>The Plains Faction and the Mountain Faction&nbsp;were locked in a rivalry.</p><p>Would the Aggressive Faction and the Moderate Faction be more appropriate?</p><p>So when Barbatos had called herself a ‘senior’ and myself a ‘rookie’, she was indirectly trying to lure me into her own faction. It was a statement with a plot in mind.</p><p>I gave a subtle glance at Barbatos.</p><p><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/dunde2-031.jpg?w=700\"></p><p>“What’s your point.”</p><p>“If you’re trying to break up with that&nbsp;succubus lover of yours, then I can help. In the first place, it doesn’t make sense for an outcast to be having sex with a Demon Lord. It’s not too late yet, so ask for my help.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>We gazed at each other for a moment.</p><p>“Are you telling me to break up with Lapis?”</p><p>“Why? Are you embarrassed? Don’t worry about it. As much as people get quickly excited here, that excitement also goes away just as fast. Give it a year and people will have long forgotten that you ever fornificated with an outcast.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Barbatos had spoken as if it was&nbsp;nothing of real importance.</p><p>I narrowed my brows.</p><p>“You’re not the one who&nbsp;gets&nbsp;to decide what&nbsp;happens between Lapis and I, I am. Don’t get too deeply involved with&nbsp;someone else’s love life.”</p><p>“Usually, I’m not this nosy. But you’re not a normal kid. You’re the big rookie that was able to get a blow on Paimon. As a senior Demon Lord, I have the obligation to show some concern for my junior’s reputation.”</p><p>Barbatos crossed her legs.</p><p>Pure white thighs and calves entered&nbsp;my vision.</p><p>“Of course, it won’t be easy breaking up with the lover that you showed so much affection for. I understand. But&nbsp;people grow stronger each time&nbsp;they lose their love, kid.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“The only significance love has is that it reveals your weakness. People don’t grow stronger through experiencing or giving love, they grow stronger after throwing it away.”</p><p>“Hou.”</p><p>I twisted the edges of my mouth.</p><p>“Is that&nbsp;<strong>really how it is</strong>?”</p><p>“Sure it is. Trust me. Despite my appearance, I’ve lived for 500 years already. The amount of lovers I’ve had a relationship with up till now is over 1,000. If you listen to my love advice then beautiful women will give you fellatio even if you’re just lying down.”</p><p>Barbatos smiled.</p><p>It was a smile that was as sly as an alley cat.</p><p>“Anyways, just tell me what led up to this split up. Let everything out and allow your mind to feel at ease. If you let it all out then you should feel lighter.”</p><p>I stayed silent for a while.</p><p>What happened to make Lapis Lazuli slap me.</p><p>The situation behind this was much too large. It contained a story that was so complexly twisted together that I had no idea where to start.</p><p>I opened my mouth slowly.</p><p>“Half a month ago an old woman visited.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>“At first, I thought she was just some beggar. Her appearance was pitiable and dirty, after all. But I soon found out that she wasn’t a mere bum. The old woman was……”</p><p>I closed my eyes for a second.</p><p>I could remember the entire scene distinctively.</p><p>“That old woman was Lapis’ mother.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day&nbsp;3</p><p>Niflheim,&nbsp;Governor’s Palace</p><p>“I see. So you’re Lala’s birth mother. What has brought you here?”</p><p>“Yes, oh great lord. This humble one has heard news of her daughter, whom this one has been roaming many years in search for. Despite having to risk discourtesy, this one had turned her path here, to your highness.”</p><p>An incredibly wrinkled old woman spoke.</p><p>I personally poured the old lady a cup of tea. She&nbsp;insisted&nbsp;that it was too much of an honor and tried to refuse many times, but despite my appearance, I put respecting the elderly foremost. Additionally, if this person was Lapis Lazuli’s mother then the game was over. Would that not make her my mother-in-law?</p><p>“Please do not make my kindness&nbsp;go to&nbsp;waste.”</p><p>“T-Thank you very much.”</p><p>The old lady, as if there was no other choice, carefully received the first glass of tea. Despite her actions,&nbsp;it didn’t feel like she truly disliked it.</p><p>“You said you have&nbsp;been roaming around in search for Lala, correct?”</p><p>“Yes, your highness.”</p><p>“To my knowledge, Lala became an orphan at a very young age. When she had gained her senses, her parents were already gone. This may be rude of me to say, but I thought that you had thrown Lala away and ran off on your own……”</p><p>“Oh no. That is not correct.”</p><p>The old lady had begun to shed tears.</p><p>“This humble woman&nbsp;was banished from her village as soon as she had&nbsp;given birth to that child. The mayor had chased this one away. A succubus who had made&nbsp;a matrimonial contract with a mere human could not possibly be accepted&nbsp;as a part of the village. That was our village’s rule.”</p><p>I listened to this old woman’s life story without a word.</p><p>“This one&nbsp;had given birth to the child on a cold winter day.&nbsp;This humble one’s conscious was still coming to and fro&nbsp;and yet the mayor had suddenly ordered this one&nbsp;to leave.&nbsp;This humble one&nbsp;pleaded stubbornly&nbsp;for more time…… for a week or at least for one more day. But it was to no avail. This lowly&nbsp;one&nbsp;was expelled from the village without having been&nbsp;able to breastfeed her own child once.……”</p><p>The old woman lowered her tea-cup and got on her knees.</p><p>She crawled to me and grasped my left hand.</p><p>“Oh great lord. The only thing this woman of humble birth had left behind for that child is&nbsp;her name, Lapis Lazuli. Her father had the same lapis&nbsp;colored eyes, and thus this one had&nbsp;named her so. That child is most certainly this humble woman’s daughter. Please, if this one could see her daughter’s face…… see if her daughter is&nbsp;doing well…… that is this woman of humble birth’s only wish.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>This old lady’s plea most certainly touched my heart.</p><p>A succubus who bore a child because of her affection towards a human.</p><p>By nature, marriage between a demon and a human was prohibited. This old lady, for having violated such a taboo, was exiled and had lost her&nbsp;daughter. For a scar formed because of a single summer night love, one could only see it as severe.</p><p>“I see. I shall arrange for you to&nbsp;meet Lapis.”</p><p>“I-Is that true!? Thank you. Thank you very much, your highness!”</p><p>“A mother is meeting her child. I’m merely granting something that is obvious. There is no reason for you to be thanking me.”</p><p>I called for Lapis Lazuli to enter the room.</p><p>Shortly after, Lapis Lazuli, wearing the same as usual tidy uniform, arrived. Lala had glanced at the old woman but it seems she was unable to recognize who the woman was.</p><p>“Did your highness call for this one?”</p><p>“Lala. My eternal lover and loyal subject.”</p><p>“……Why is your highness behaving like that all of a sudden? Whenever your highness starts to imitate a weird way of speech, this one can’t help but feel a&nbsp;strange anxiety.”</p><p>“Examine this old woman here. Do you&nbsp;recognize her, perhaps?”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli narrowed her brows.</p><p>It was a face displaying that she had no idea.</p><p>“This one is sorry, but this individual&nbsp;is an utter stranger to this one.”</p><p>“Look more carefully. Do you truly not know?”</p><p>“This one is unable to&nbsp;guess what your highness is thinking.”</p><p>It was then that the old lady started to approach Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>While letting out a cry, the old lady hugged Lala.</p><p>“Aah……! My child! This is certainly my child!”</p><p>Due to&nbsp;the sudden situation, Lapis Lazuli froze. Instead of appearing confused, she more looked as if she was unable to understand what was happening. It was that kind of feeling. Lala turned to look this way.</p><p>“Your highness. Please explain.”</p><p>“As you heard just now, that person is your birth mother. Of course, there are many things that must be confirmed first, but surely a person wouldn’t tell&nbsp;a lie while in the presence&nbsp;of a Demon Lord, when the truth could&nbsp;be revealed at any time.”</p><p>I felt somewhat proud.</p><p>An orphan was able to reunite&nbsp;with their parent. Even for myself, who always thought pessimistically, I couldn’t help but be touched by&nbsp;this reunion. I leisurely waited for the words ‘thank you’ to come out from Lapis Lazuli’s mouth.</p><p>But.</p><p>“……”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli was strange.</p><p>A peculiar emotion had appeared in her eyes for an instant. It was truly a short moment. If one were to calculate the time, then it was as&nbsp;short as a blink. Lapis Lazuli’s face was indifferent—perhaps&nbsp;too&nbsp;indifferent.</p><p>Despite not knowing what exactly that emotion was.</p><p>It was certain that it wasn’t the type of expression a person should have made when meeting their own mother for the first time in decades.</p><p>I quickly made a decision.</p><p>“Lapis Lazuli.”</p><p>“Yes, your highness.”</p><p>“Kneel.”</p><p>Without asking any questions, Lapis Lazuli knelt down. I wonder if the old woman&nbsp;was confused by the sudden order I had given, but she&nbsp;was looking back and forth between&nbsp;Lapis and I with&nbsp;a bewildered gaze.</p><p>I approached Lazuli and swung my right hand. It wasn’t a joke. I had properly put strength into my arm and slapped her. Lapis Lazuli, unable to withstand the force, fell onto the floor. As soon as this happened, the old woman let out a sharp scream.</p><p>“W-What is your highness! What is your highness doing!?”</p><p>“Be silent, you shallow-minded succubus. Say another word and I will slice off your tongue&nbsp;and shove it into your ear.”</p><p>I ignored the old woman’s cry and grabbed Lapis Lazuli&nbsp;by the hair. I then lifted Lala’s body up by force. Lapis Lazuli didn’t let out a single sound&nbsp;and simply looked up at me with emotionless eyes.</p><p>“Confess. Did you dare to use dirty tricks?”</p><p>“……This one has found out for the first time that your highness is a lot more violent than this one had originally thought.”</p><p>“You’re quite good at shamelessly moving your trap like that. Did you become blinded just because you had gained my royal grace? I had allowed a mere peasant like you to stand by my side and now you want me to treat your parent as well? Speak. Am I your lord or your coin bag?”</p><p>I glanced slightly at the old woman and could see her lips trembling.</p><p>It seems she couldn’t understand what was going on before her.</p><p>“Your mother did not come looking for you. You’re the one who probably found your mother first. You and your mother planned this unamusing performance to ridicule me, am I right?”</p><p>“That’s not possible…… great lord, it’s a misunderstanding!”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The old lady shouted out as if she was screaming.</p><p>“This humble one has only met her daughter for the first time today! There was no occasion of this one and her daughter meeting beforehand and devising a plot against your highness. Please believe this one!”</p><p>“I know very well how crafty your daughter is. Always trying to fool me and stab me in the back whenever she gets the chance. This is the same. It wasn’t enough that you alone were living in wealth, so you brought in your own mother. You&nbsp;disgraceful woman.”</p><p>I slapped Lala’s cheek once more.</p><p>Once, twice, thrice, I continued to hit her.</p><p>Each time the old lady screamed over and over again. But that was it. Once I had taken out a dagger the old woman hurriedly ran out of the room and escaped off to somewhere.</p><p>“……”</p><p>The reception room was silent.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli stood up and silently dusted her skirt.&nbsp;Lala’s face was still expressionless, and it seems she didn’t feel any particular&nbsp;pain from her swollen red cheek.</p><p>“……Damn it.”</p><p><em>Thud</em></p><p>I stabbed the blade into the table.</p><p>“It was a lie. Your mother ridiculed us with her lie, Lala! She didn’t come looking for you because she was worried, she probably&nbsp;planned to simply latch onto you like some parasite.”</p><div></div><p>“That is most likely correct.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli spoke calmly.</p><p>“This one has been officially approved as your highness Dantalian’s mistress. Adding to that, your highness has also joined the ranks of the&nbsp;wealthiest people&nbsp;on the continent. This one’s mother had mostly likely approached your highness and this one aiming for our wealth.”</p><p>“To run away by herself&nbsp;when her&nbsp;own daughter was being beaten……!”</p><p>It was a simple but extreme&nbsp;test.</p><p>To confirm&nbsp;what the old woman’s true intentions were.</p><p>If that old woman had truly wandered for 40 years in search for her child, then there was no chance that she would stand by idly and allow the violence to happen. She would have tried to stop me even if she had to risk her own life.</p><p>However, that old hag had ran away much too easily. What did this mean? It meant that that old woman, as a mother, did not love or treasure Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>The likelihood of her visit here was ten to one for money. She most likely crawled her way here&nbsp;to lean on her daughter and live a life of luxury. My heart became pitch-black with rage.</p><p>“For the person who had&nbsp;irresponsibly copulated with a man, irresponsibly had a child, and irresponsibly ran away from the village by herself—&nbsp;to try and come back and act&nbsp;as a mother now! How barefaced could someone be after abandoning their child for 40 years!”</p><p>“Your highness.”</p><p>“I’ll kill her!”</p><p>I shouted.</p><p>“I’ll cut off her tongue, break her limbs, and throw her in a pig sty. It’s only appropriate for that kind of mongrel to receive divine punishment. If the Gods are neglecting their duty then there’s no choice but for me to punish her in their stead!”</p><p>“Your highness.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli looked straight at me.</p><p>“Compose yourself. There is no reason for your highness to dirty your hands.”</p><p>“No, there is more than enough reason, Lala. You are my lover. Be it a false cover&nbsp;or not you are still my fiancée. The ridicule you receive thus becomes my humiliation. The ridicule I receive thus becomes your humiliation. How could there possibly be no value!?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Don’t worry. How could I possibly tell you to kill your own mother. Just wait patiently. I’ll take care of it&nbsp;discretely. I’ll make sure to not allow that kind of trash from ever intervening with your life ever again. First bribe the guards and……”</p><p><em>Slap</em></p><p>I wasn’t able to comprehend what had happened to me for a moment.</p><p>It was because it was something that I had never expected to&nbsp;happen.</p><p>I looked at Lapis Lazuli with a dazed face, still unable to believe what had happened.</p><p>“Lord Dantalian.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“This one said to compose yourself.”</p><p>The feeling in my chest settled down.</p><p>Lala had slapped me just now.</p><p>That itself was not a problem. Did I not also hit her cheek several times earlier? An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. She naturally had the rights to hit me as well. However, the fact that ‘Lazuli had hit me’ was what gave me a shock.</p><p>“Lala……”</p><p>“Has your highness finally calmed down?”</p><p>“I’m sorry. I did not hit you earlier because I wanted to. I apologize for swinging my hand like some brute. I really am. But I had to make sure if your mother was being sincere or not.”</p><p>I spoke in a low voice.</p><p>“If I did not properly make this fact clear, then I thought that in the end, you’d be the one to be hurt. At the price of becoming the bad guy, I wanted to guarantee your safety. I will vow on this, I did not have any ulterior motive.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“This one knows, but that is not the problem.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli shook her head.</p><p>“There is no reason to apologize for hitting this one. This one is a peasant. Just being by your highness Dantalian’s side this one is able to bask in an undeserved privilege. The real problem is something else.”</p><p>“What do you mean by the real problem……?”</p><p>“Does your highness not know?”</p><p>This type of questions drove me mad.</p><p>The other person had the answer but I did not. If that was so, then I should have the right to at least know the question, but for some reason the other person held back both the answer and the question. Was this not excessively unfair?</p><p>“Lala. I do not wish to have a debate with you.”</p><p>“It is not a debate.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli bowed her head.</p><p>“It is a simple test.”</p><p>And&nbsp;then Lala left the room.</p><p>Without asking for my permission to be excused.</p><p>I suddenly found&nbsp;myself alone in the room and blankly stared at the empty space in front of me. It was then that a half-transparent notice window appeared.</p><p><strong>[Lapis Lazuli’s affection went down by 1.]</strong></p><p>For a long time I stared vacantly at the notice. Because there was no one else in the room to hear my words, I muttered weakly towards the empty air.</p><p>“…… What was the problem?”</p><p>The sound of birds chirping could be heard through the window.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day 20</p><p>Niflheim, Hermes’ Plaza</p><p>“What was the problem?”</p><p>Barbatos looked as if she was at a loss for words.</p><p>It was the kind of face that looked as if she wanted me to bite my tongue and commit suicide.</p><p>“You tried to kill your lover’s mom!”</p><p>Hm.</p><p>“……So what?”</p><p>“Oh Goddess Persephone. Good God. Why you haven’t taken away this idiotic&nbsp;wuss yet is beyond me.”</p><p>Barbatos covered her forehead with her hand.</p><p>“Dantalian.&nbsp;Do you want me to tell you really, really honestly?”</p><p>“A truthful answer&nbsp;would be&nbsp;much better than a hypocritical answer.”</p><p>“Before hearing your story, I sincerely advised you to break up with your succubus lover, right? But now it’s really vague. You retard. If you’re going to be slapped by an outcast,&nbsp;then you deserved to have been&nbsp;slapped hundreds and thousands of times.”</p><p>“Oi. What would you have done then?”</p><p>I lowered the ice pack.</p><p>The cheek that was slapped by Lala was still hot.</p><p>“There’s a girl that you really love. But this girl, disregarding her own volition, was born into this world purely because of her parent’s mistake. As soon as she had left the womb she was immediately branded as an ‘outcast’. Even now, Barbatos, you disregard her as well.”</p><p>Barbatos creased her brows.</p><p>“I don’t ignore people based on social status. I differentiate them.”</p><p>“You mean discriminate. Anyways, that’s fine. In brief, the main culprit to make Lapis Lazuli’s life turn into&nbsp;a gutter was that old hag. What was I supposed to do? What would you have&nbsp;done?”</p><p>The people who I despised the most was the group of individuals that had a child irresponsibly. My father had done so, and so had my mother.</p><p>Normal people couldn’t understand how frustrating it was&nbsp;for a child whose life was already ruined at the age of 10. However, compared to Lala, my life could be considered as a blessing. Her life was crumpled up like a piece of aluminum foil since the age of 1.</p><p>“I can’t forgive that old woman. Forgiving her would be wrong. Damn it. I shouldn’t have worried about what Lapis had in mind and just killed that woman then and there.”</p><p>“Dantalian……”</p><p>With a sound effect a hologram displayed in front of me.</p><p><strong>[The other party is disappointed in you.]</strong></p><p><strong>[Demon Lord Barbatos’ affection went down by 3.]</strong></p><p>“You’re quite the twisted guy, aren’t you.”</p><p>Barbatos gave me a look of sympathy.</p><p>“You look perfectly fine but the inside of your skull is defective. You don’t even&nbsp;realize that you look like a mental patient right now, do you?”</p><p>“I’m perfectly normal.”</p><p>“There are two types of people who claim that they are perfectly normal. One is a&nbsp;murderer, and the other&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;soon&nbsp;to be murderer.”</p><p>Barbatos lowered her back slightly.</p><p>She stared at me very seriously.</p><p>“Anyone will make mistakes as they live their life. Of course, if they make a mistake then they should&nbsp;be punished. Up to that point&nbsp;is&nbsp;fine. But you’re stating that the punishment must be execution no matter what. And at your lover’s birth mother, at that.”</p><p>“If there is a whore&nbsp;who deserves to die, then they should.”</p><p>Barbatos let out a sigh.</p><p>“…… Did you say your lover’s name was Lapis Lazuli? Damn she’s admirable. How the hell was she able to deal with you? If it were me, I’d have cut your balls off and ran away long time ago. You two really should just break up.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Are you taking my side right now or Lala’s?”</p><p>“I don’t know, you idiot.”</p><p>Barbatos scratched her head.</p><p>“I was hoping that an actual useful rookie had appeared after such a long time, but isn’t he&nbsp;just a complete mental patient? Haaa, my fate is always like this…… If you take out his love affairs then he sort of seems okay, but how the hell do I make this retard&nbsp;function like&nbsp;an actual person……”</p><p>“Hello? I can hear everything you’re saying.”</p><p>“Of course you did since I wanted you to hear it. Mr. Bitch, I’m thinking in a present progressive form on whether if I should appoint myself to be your nanny. This is quite the deep shit.”</p><p>Barbatos clutched her forehead and groaned.</p><p>It was like she was contemplating on how deep she was planning to step into someone else’s life.</p><p>If you become concerned with another person’s personal problem then you’d most likely end up in an endless swamp. Barbatos was probably thinking about that sticky feeling.</p><p>I wonder if she had finally made a decision.</p><p>“……Okay. Keep talking.”</p><p>Barbatos had an&nbsp;expression that appeared as if she had resigned herself to a knot somewhere in her mind.</p><p>“Keep talking? About what?”</p><p>“You dumbass. I’m talking about your love business. From what you’ve told me up&nbsp;till now, it doesn’t seem like there’s a huge problem between you and your succubus lover yet. You may have quarreled but that wasn’t a big enough fight to result in a break up. Just what kind of shit did you pull during the rest of the month that made that kid so appalled at you?”</p><p>“I see you’re talking in a tone as if you’re already certain that I’m the one at fault.”</p><p>“Yeah. I’m certain. If you think it’s unfair then prove your innocence, tsk……”</p><p>Barbatos gazed out the window.</p><p>It was still mid-day so the outside was bright.</p><p>As if she was estimating the weight of the sunlight, Barbatos narrowed her eyes. The sunlight polished&nbsp;her calves and slid down them.</p><p>Honestly speaking, it was charming.</p><p>Even the sunlight would be pleased by the fact that it had kissed Barbatos’ leg. There was no doubt that it’d at least be happier than falling onto my head. If it weren’t for her childish figure, then I may have even fallen for her.</p><p>“……Oi. Where are you looking at?”</p><p>Barbatos was glaring this way&nbsp;as if she was looking at something rotten.</p><p>I responded honestly.</p><p>“I was admiring your leg.”</p><p>“It’s not free so if you want to admire them then pay up.”</p><p>“You can just look at my leg instead.”</p><p>“Say that after you shave all your leg hair.”</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>“I obtained information.”</p><p>Barbatos tilted her head.</p><p>“What information?”</p><p>“A small letter. There was no name and no sender written on it. Only two sentences were written on it with a quill&nbsp;pen. The content was quite memorable.”</p><p>I took out a piece of paper from my pocket and passed it over.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>You have an enemy.10 days from now, an army of 2,000 men will invade your Demon Lord castle.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Barbatos let out a noise from her nose.</p><p>“A straight up&nbsp;threat is written here, huh.”</p><p>“I see it more as a warning than a threat.”</p><p>“Why? Even at glance it looks like a bluff.”</p><p>“Look at the lines&nbsp;carefully, Barbatos. It may only be two sentences but many contexts implications are hidden within them. First, ‘You have an enemy’ is written here. This is subtly hinting that ‘I am not your enemy’.”</p><p>This was too mild to be treated as a threat letter.</p><p>That was why when I&nbsp;had received this message a month ago, Lala and I had contemplated about it.</p><p>Who, with what intention, would have sent this kind of letter.</p><p>“Looking at the writing style, the personage who had written this letter is of the&nbsp;upperclass and has received professional education. By the way the words are slightly tilted, you can judge the person is either right-handed or ambidextrous.”</p><p>“…… You can tell all that?”</p><p>“This is all nothing more than assumptions.”</p><p>I leaned back into the chair.</p><p>I continued talking in a comfortable position.</p><p>“There’s also a high chance that the person is engaged in business at the top.”</p><p>Barbatos creased her brows.</p><p>“Haa? Why the top?”</p><p>“If you have eyes then look at the number.”</p><table><tbody><tr><td>10 days from now, an army of 2,000 men will invade your Demon Lord castle.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>“There’s a comma&nbsp;between the 2 and 0. That’s why there’s a high chance that the person is working in a high position.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Barbatos still had a confused face.</p><p>It seemed that this violent child of a Demon Lord was not good at turning her head in this kind of places. I let out a sigh and kindly explained it for her.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Normal people don’t put a comma when writing numbers in the thousands. They usually write it as 2000 without any special symbol. But the person to have written this letter had habitually added a comma.”</p><p>Thus meaning, a person who normally worked with a large amount of money.</p><p>A person who would always put a comma whenever three 0’s were besides each other.</p><p>A person who interacted with large numbers like 1,000,000 on a day-to-day basis.</p><p>“There’s no doubt that this person deals with either accounting documents or ledgers frequently. This person could be a grand chamberlain for a territory, or they could be a merchant that works in a high position.”</p><p>“Is that so……”</p><p>Barbatos made a wry face as she looked down at the letter.</p><p>“Your brain really isn’t there for nothing.”</p><p>“Don’t be moved already. There’s still 5 hidden truths in this letter. But if I were explain each and every one of them then I’d die of boredom, so I’ll skip them.”</p><p>Since olden times, secrets were similar to sex.</p><p>When taking off your partner’s clothes you had to carefully remove a single layer at a time. What enjoyment could&nbsp;you possibly get for ripping their clothes off all at once?</p><p>Everything was at its highest point of beauty when half-stripped. Like a woman who was only half revealed would be more charming than a fully nude woman, secrets had the best taste when only stripped here and there and then cooked.</p><p>C’est si bon.</p><p>“This guy is a completely perverted bastard, isn’t he?”</p><p>After listening to my esthetics, Barbatos’ face distorted.</p><p>“Anyways, you’re saying that there’s a high possibility that the culprit is a merchant, right?”</p><p>“Mm. At least from the outside.”</p><p>I scratched my forehead.</p><p>“Thankfully, I have a deep friendship with merchants. If, perhaps, the person to have sent this letter really was a merchant and was merely playing a prank, then it would be&nbsp;more than easy to catch the&nbsp;culprit.”</p><p>“Hm? How?”</p><p>I smiled smoothly.</p><p>“I told you. Merchants are my friends.”</p>"

I, too, wish to believe that you’re innocent.&nbsp;But you&nbsp;have&nbsp;conspired against me and attacked me in the past, have you not? In other words, you&nbsp;are&nbsp;not completely trustworthy yet.”</p><p>“This one no longer plans to be hostile against your highness.”</p><p>“That is quite the pity. I’m unable&nbsp;to believe you.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok ground his teeth.</p><p>(TL Note: I plan to stick with calling Ivar by the gender of the individual he’s currently possessing.)</p><p>It was clear that he was upset. He did have more than enough reason to be angry, after all.</p><p>This person before me was originally&nbsp;one of the highest people of authority. He was the richest person in the demon world as well as the behind-the-scenes ruler of the free city of Niflheim.</p><p>That person had fallen and was now acting as my puppet. He yipped like a dog at my every command. It became quite pitiable. Even so, I did not plan to forgive him so easily.</p><p>“What does this one have to do in order to gain your highness’ trust?”</p><p>“Simply&nbsp;do a couple of favors for me.”</p><p>“What kind of favors……?”</p><p>“First, I’d like to hire some soldiers.”</p><p>It was written on the anonymous letter that an army of two thousand men were going to invade.</p><p>Although it was still uncertain whether the letter was true or false, there was nothing bad about being prepared. At the very least three thousand. Yes, I wanted to&nbsp;be prepared with an army of at least three thousand soldiers.</p><p>“I consider this to be a light&nbsp;request. If it’s the marvelous&nbsp;Keuncuska Firm then surely you’ll be able to gather three thousand men&nbsp;easily. Do you not think so?”</p><p>“……Of course. Your highness.”</p><p>The other party had an expression as if he had chewed on shit.</p><p>Oi, your emotions are showing all over your face.</p><p>Was he perhaps looking at me with contempt? Was that it. Did he decide that he didn’t have to keep up appearances in front of me?</p><p>That was troubling. A pet that looked down on their own owner had no use. It seems I had to teach this vampire manners once more.</p><p>“Lodbrok. Do you perhaps dislike me?”</p><p>“…… That is not possible. This one holds respect and loyalty&nbsp;for the Demon Lords in this one’s chest at all times.”</p><p>“That is a relief. I like you quite a bit as well. I was worried that it might have been one-sided love. One-sided love is only beautiful during one’s childhood.&nbsp;But at this age, is it not vulgar to be caught up in such a thing?”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok looked at me with a doubtful gaze. He was most likely trying to figure out&nbsp;what I was talking about.</p><p>I took something out from my sleeve. Well, it wasn’t anything too important. A single strand of hair. It was merely a single strand of blonde hair.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok grimaced.</p><p>“What may that be?”</p><p>“I’ll say it again. I like you quite a bit as well. Except, not your elderly&nbsp;appearance but your original body. Your delicate and female form. I prefer that more.”</p><p>“……!”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok’s eyes trembled&nbsp;with unease.</p><p>Lodbrok’s main body was a girl with blonde hair. The hair that I had just pulled out was also blonde. What could this mean?</p><p>“Surely……!”</p><p>“In regards to your body, I personally prefer&nbsp;your calves. Your petite chest and the outline of your waist is also fine. But I really do think that your calves are the best.”</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>“If you caress&nbsp;it carefully then you can feel both the firmness of your&nbsp;shin and the softness of your calves at the same time.&nbsp;It felt like my hands would melt because of how soft they were. The rose-like fragrance emanating&nbsp;from your skin almost made me unintentionally want to lick you.”</p><p>“Did your highness not promise not to touch this one’s main body!”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok let out an enraged shout.</p><p>“This one had betrayed her highness Paimon as your highness had ordered! This one had protected your highness while sacrificing a firm executive! Then why……!”</p><p>“Do not misunderstand.”</p><p>I spoke in a carefree tone.</p><p>“We did not make a promise. Promises are something that&nbsp;are mutually benificial. However, our relationship is a bit simpler than that. Chief. It’s absolute&nbsp;obedience.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Kneel.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok stiffened.</p><p>I wonder if he wasn’t able to properly hear my&nbsp;request. Seeing that he was trapped in an old man’s body, was&nbsp;his hearing perhaps damaged as well? This was certainly possible. Do not worry. I believed in respecting the elderly. I’m a man who was able to&nbsp;show&nbsp;compassion&nbsp;towards elders&nbsp;as much as it is required.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>With&nbsp;a gentle tone, I ordered once more.</p><p>“Kneel down, chief.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Go on.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok slowly bent his knees.</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“Now come&nbsp;here.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Humiliation and rage dyed the old gentleman’s face.</p><p>I couldn’t help but love whenever a person of power made an expression like that. It felt like I was watching a delinquent mending their own ways. I almost wanted to praise the beauty of mankind out loud.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok crawled towards me.</p><p>I took off my shoe and&nbsp;pressed my right foot down against the old gentleman’s head. It was, of course, a ridiculing action. Ivar Lodbrok’s shoulders trembled.</p><p>“Chief.”</p><p>“……Yes, your highness.”</p><p>“Please conduct yourself with more caution while standing before me. I did not ridicule you the moment we met. Normally and softly. I treated you like an accomplice&nbsp;of equal standing, and yet, did you not look at me as if you were looking at trash?”</p><p><em>Press press.</em></p><p>I pushed his head down further.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok’s nose touched the floor.</p><p>“This is why communication is impossible. How long do you plan to leave me in an unrequited love? If you desire for me to respect&nbsp;your dignity, then you must respect my dignity first. Do you understand?”</p><p>“This one will, most certainly keep that in mind……”</p><p>“Prepare the three thousand troops within 2 days.”</p><p>I withdrew my foot.</p><p>“It’d be troubling if you were to gather a bunch of random people, so I shall request for the best quality of soldiers. According to the message, the invasion will happen in 10 days, so do hurry.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok quickly brought his head back up.</p><p>“Your highness. Two days is much too short! At the very least, allow us a week…… no even if your highness were to give us half a month, it would be near impossible to hire three thousand soldiers of the best quality.”</p><p>“What are you talking about? There are plenty of troops nearby.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“Are there not soldiers protecting Niflheim? I heard that the military force here was around 8,000 men. Lend me some from there.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok opened his mouth.</p><p>It was a face as if he&nbsp;had just heard an unbelievable suggestion.</p><p>“Your highness! Those are this city’s defenses!”</p><p>“And you are the actual ruler of Niflheim. You can move the forces around as much as you please.”</p><p>“Please understand! If the soldiers are gone then the method of defending Niflheim disappears with them. Niflheim is a free city that is responsible for all the economy in the demon world. If this place were to fall then a huge misfortune will fall over the entire demon world. If that were to happen while the Black Death is still running rampant……!”</p><p>“Whoa, whoa. Calm down.”</p><p>I stood from my chair.</p><p>I lifted&nbsp;Ivar Lodbrok back up on his feet&nbsp;and tidily&nbsp;brushed all the dust off of his clothes. Ivar Lodbrok, not sure how to react, was unable to say anything in response.</p><p>“Of course there are many things to worry about. The danger you’ll have to shoulder will also be large. I understand everything. I really do. But regardless of all that, chief. It is very unfortunate, but.”</p><p>Finally,&nbsp;dusted Ivar Lodbrok’s shoulder.</p><p>“That is your problem. Not mine.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>I smiled widely.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok was at a loss for words.</p><p>“Ah. I&nbsp;should&nbsp;point out that this hair is not from your main body. How could I do such a thing when I respect you so much, chief? Do not worry.”</p><p>“Pardon? Then where……?”</p><p>“I plucked the hair off of a dog that was wandering&nbsp;around the governor’s palace after playing with him a bit. That dog’s color and charm was quite refined. As expected, if the owner is well off&nbsp;then even the pets live a life of luxury.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok’s expression quickly changed.</p><p>He must have realized that he had just ridiculed himself all because of some dog hair and was dumbfounded.</p><p>That’s why you shouldn’t have retaliated so uselessly. We could have happily gone off on our own ways without having to upset one another. I couldn’t understand the people who insisted on upholding their pride when they knew that they were obviously going to lose. Are you a masochist? Do you enjoy receiving pain on purpose? This is quite troubling that there are so many perverts in the world……</p><p>“Three thousand soldiers. Highest quality. I leave this within your hands, chief.”</p><p>“……Yes.”</p><p>“Oh, right. I would also like for you to acquire some information.”</p><p>I grinned.</p><p>“This as well isn’t a very difficult task so you have no need to be worried. It’s a task to find a single human. Ah, while you’re at it purchase the finest bottle of wine for me.”</p><p>“Whatever this one is ordered to……”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>It seems he had finally given&nbsp;up on resisting. Ivar Lodbrok bowed his head. It was cute because his drooping hair resembled&nbsp;dog ears.</p><p>The fact that he had a lot of wrinkles was a flaw, but oh well. It’d be better if I just thought of it as raising a pet with a strong sense of pride. I’d feel sorry if I shoved him around too much, so I should give him a reward later on. Oh no. I shouldn’t have a&nbsp;hobby like raising a pet……</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day&nbsp;7</p><p>Niflheim,&nbsp;Governor’s Palace</p><p>I could hear the sound of paper being shuffled.</p><p>I wonder if I&nbsp;had been sweating throughout the night as my back felt wet. I rubbed my eyes and turned my head to see Lapis Lazuli reading a report next to me on the bed.</p><p>“Lodbrok?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>In response to my short question asking if those were the reports from Lodbrok, Lapis Lazuli answered immediately.</p><p>One week had passed since we had become lovers. Curiously, our words got across to each other rather well. Should I say that our compatibility was good? No, it might be excessively easy-going to even regard her as my lover……</p><p>“How is it.”</p><p>“The&nbsp;level of the information is favorable. The total slave markets located in the northern region of Sardinia is 13. Among them,&nbsp;the amount of slave markets that handle in slaves born from noble families are 4. The slave which your highness is looking for is registered in Pavia.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli took out a single document.</p><p>I shook my head and buried my nose into her thighs. It felt as if&nbsp;she had applied some kind of sweet oil on her skin. A delightful scent emanated&nbsp;from her.</p><p>“Olive oil?”</p><p>“It is&nbsp;Anatolia mountain rose oil. Your highness. If your highness has the time to sexually harass this one, then please take a look at the report first.”</p><p>“I do not wish to read words as soon as I wake up in the morning. I’d appreciate it if you could read it out loud in my stead.”</p><p>“It’s not morning but the afternoon.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli let out a sigh.</p><p>“This one thinks that it’s because of your highness that this one’s life cycle is being ruined. Too much time is being consumed from having sexual relations once. This one advises your highness to lower 4 hours to 2.”</p><p>“What am I supposed to do when my stamina is peerless?”</p><p>I lightly pecked&nbsp;Lala’s bottom.</p><p>“I do not have the tendency to sate my desires quickly. In any case, it’s quite the problem that men these days do not know how to show consideration to women. How pleasant it is to enjoy each others’ warmth and……”</p><p>“This one knows. It is already well-known for this one that your highness is a pervert beyond imagination, so this one does not need another lesson.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli resigned herself and began to read the report.</p><p>“—Laura De Farsene. Ever since her birth&nbsp;as an illegitimate child in Duke Farsene’s family, she was&nbsp;confined in the mansion at all times. Although it hasn’t been revealed on who her birth mother is, there is a rumor that she was born after the duke had raped one of the servants.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>I stroked Lapis Lazuli’s thigh as I listened to her talk.</p><p>Lala had no useless fat. It was most likely because she was born as an outcast and spent her childhood starving. Roaming the alleyways and finding scraps from garbage cans. Being cursed at for being a half-breed. Having stones tossed at her constantly.</p><p>……I should have killed that old woman.</p><p>I really did regret it.</p><p>“It seems Miss&nbsp;Farsene lived a very underprivileged&nbsp;childhood.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli continued.</p><p>“Not only the mansion, but she was strictly forbidden from leaving her bedroom as well. Her siblings did not consider Miss&nbsp;Farnese as a part of their family, and even the servants treated her as if she did not exist…… Your highness? Are you listening?”</p><p>“Of course. I’m listening diligently.”</p><p>“Although, this one thinks your highness has only been touching this one’s&nbsp;thigh since awhile ago.”</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re just seeing&nbsp;things.”</p><p>“……This one will continue reading.”</p><p>Laura De Farsene.</p><p>She was an important character that appeared in &lt;Dungeon Attack&gt;.</p><p>Similar to the protagonist, she was an influential individual of that era, but if one were to point out a&nbsp;difference, then it was that she pushed the world into terror&nbsp;instead of hope.</p><p>There was a slight complicated political reason that was involved behind this.</p><p>The &lt;Dungeon Attack&gt; protagonist, the hero, was affiliated with the ‘Empire of Habsburg’. On the other hand, Laura De Farsene worked for the nation known as the ‘Kingdom of Brittany’. The empire and the kingdom, wanting to decide who was the&nbsp;true ruler of the entire continent, started a massive war.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>There was a chance that, compared to the Demon Lords, the amount of humans that&nbsp;died because of Miss Farsene was higher.&nbsp;In other words, for the protagonist you could say that she was an opponent far more terrifying than the Demon Lords.</p><p>Well, these&nbsp;were&nbsp;things that would&nbsp;happen 15 to 20 years in the future.</p><p>In the current time, Laura De Farsene was nothing more than a frail and weak 16-year-old girl.</p><p>What was there to hide?</p><p>I wanted to snatch this girl&nbsp;who was fated&nbsp;to become a great general in the future in advance.</p><p>Since it seemed that 2,000 soldiers were going to invade from an unknown region. While I was hiring troops, I wanted to recruit a commander at the same time. Kill two birds with one stone.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli finished reading the report and spoke.</p><p>“Your highness. There is something that this one wishes to ask. Why does your highness have an interest in a child from the human race?”</p><p>“There is no particular reason. Simply that this child harbors the most hatred towards humans.”</p><p>I told her a lie nonchalantly.</p><p>There was no special reason. It would be more troubling if I were to answer her honestly and say ‘It’s something I know because I played the game, but that kid is going to grow up to be the greatest general in the continent’. I could only dramatize a&nbsp;reason and tell it to her.</p><p>“……Hatred, is it?”</p><p>“Yes. Think of it while in that girl’s position. She was born as an illegitimate child and spent her days forever trapped in her room. She received abuse from the people who were supposed to be her family. She was avoided by even the servants. And now that the family has fallen into ruin, Laura De Farsene has plummeted to being a slave and is being sold at a market. What do you think would be lurking in this girl’s mind? What would this girl earnestly desire for? Would she not be nourishing her hatred towards humans?”</p><div></div><p>“……”</p><p>“To me, I need this kind of child. A child burning with hatred more than anyone else. I need a child who would sell her own soul to the devil if it meant getting&nbsp;revenge on the humans. Laura De Farsene, an individual just to my preferences.”</p><p>I chuckled.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli looked at me with an impassive expression.</p><p>She had eyes that appeared as if she understood but also didn’t understand at the same time.</p><p>“What? Are you disappointed that it wasn’t the answer&nbsp;that you had hoped for?”</p><p>“Slightly.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli tilted her head.</p><p>“This one was certain that your highness wanted to obtain and enjoy a high quality sex slave from a noble birth.”</p><p>“What? What kind of nonsense…… Wait. What kind of person do you see me as?”</p><p>“Of course, this one sees it as it is.”</p><p>There’s a vassal here that’s treating their lord like a human scumbag!</p><p>I vaguely understood the reason why Lapis Lazuli’s affection&nbsp;was yet to get past 10. No, well, I actually am a human, though! I’m not depraved enough to do something disgusting like getting a sex slave.</p><p>“Lala.”</p><p>I spoke in an incredibly serious tone.</p><p>“I’ll use this chance to tell you clearly.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“I prefer mature adults.”</p><p>It was truly so.</p><p>Lolita complex was a mental illness.</p><p>“I can’t stand people&nbsp;that still smell like a child. Of course, I prefer large chests over smaller ones, and I prefer a generous bottom over a petite one. Do you understand. People who like a child’s body are all insane with a bunch of loose screws in their heads.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli nodded.</p><p>“To sum it up, more than her highness Barbatos, her highness Paimon is closer to your highness’ preference.”</p><p>“Before talking about whether it’s close or far, I just dislike&nbsp;a child’s body. Even if the other side approached and offered themselves&nbsp;to me, I’d decline!”</p><p>“That is a shame. If your highness was obtaining Miss Farsene with the intention to sate your highness’ sexual desires, then this one was going to actively support the decision, since it meant that this one’s burden would be reduced by quite the amount.”</p><p>“Did you dislike sleeping with me that much!? No, wait. In the end, wasn’t it you who came on to me first……!?”</p><p>“My apologies. At that time, this one had yet to realize&nbsp;that your highness was actually a stallion. Your highness had even satisfied yourself fully on the first night, 3 times in a row at that…… Honestly, this one has started to regret it.”</p><p>“Isn’t that too much!?”</p><p>I had ended up hearing from my lover of 1 week that she was&nbsp;already regretting her decision.</p><p>It may have been merely&nbsp;a physical relationship with no love whatsoever, but I couldn’t help but receive a blow……</p><p>While I was chatting with Lapis Lazuli, someone knocked on the door.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Oh great lord. Your highness’ lunch has arrived.”</p><p>“Ah. It’s fine to enter.”</p><p>It was the maids that were working in the governor’s palace.</p><p>The maids opened the door and came into the room. Each maid was carrying a silver tray. They looked this way and all their faces froze at once. A man and woman were laying on the bed in the nude. Although we were covered up by a blanket, my upper body was in the open.</p><p>“E-Excuse us! Your highness!”</p><p>“It’s fine. The one to have ordered for you all to enter was myself, there is no reason for you all to apologize.&nbsp;Pay us no mind and set up lunch.”</p><p>“Ah…… Understood.”</p><p>The maids gratefully placed the cuisines down onto the table. Although they did their best to be indifferent to us and keep their heads in place, they ended up instinctively peeking at us.</p><p>Hm? Was it their first time seeing a Demon Lord without clothes on?</p><p>Finding it amusing, I silently kept watch of the maids until I heard the sound of a tongue clicking with a ‘tsk’. It was&nbsp;so low that I could have missed the sound. My heart became drastically cold.</p><p>“The likes of us shall take our leave now.”</p><p>“All of you. Stop right there.”</p><p>The maids froze in place&nbsp;at the door.</p><p>I unintentionally ended up speaking in a cold voice.</p><p>“Who was the one to click their tongue.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“Do not play innocent. I clearly heard one of you click your tongue. Confess who the culprit is.”</p><p>The maids looked at each other with a panicked gaze. But only for a short moment. Their eyes naturally gathered onto a single&nbsp;person. It was a girl&nbsp;with cat ears from the beast race.</p><p>Is that so. Are you the main culprit who&nbsp;clicked their tongue?</p><p>I put on a loose gown and got up from the bed.</p><p>“……”</p><p>During that time, the maid from the beast race had realized her mistake and started to&nbsp;tremble. Her teeth chattered. It seems her colleagues had predicted what her fate was going to be as they had taken a few steps away.</p><p>“Name.”</p><p>“J……J-Julia, is this one’s name.”</p><p>“I see. Julia. You have a pretty name.”</p><p>In contrast to&nbsp;the compliment, my face was stern.</p><p>“Why did you click your tongue earlier.”</p><p>“T-This one is terribly sorry, your highness. Please forgive this one!”</p><p>“I asked why you had clicked your tongue.”</p><p>The maid could not answer.</p><p>It was fine. I wasn’t asking her in hopes for her to answer me. I already knew the answer.</p><p>This girl didn’t click her&nbsp;tongue at me. Slightly to my side. In other words,&nbsp;while glaring at Lapis Lazuli, she had clicked her tongue.</p><p>That put me in a foul mood.</p><p>Incredibly.</p><p>To the point where I could barely control my rage.</p><p>“Are you looking down at the sight of myself being intimate with my lover?”</p><p>“No. Your highness, this one did not think anything like that……!”</p><p>“I understand. It must have been very unpleasant to see a mere half-breed peasant in the same bed as a Demon Lord. It must have been a sour sight for you. That’s why you clicked your tongue at my lover, right?”</p><p>“T-This one…… This one was……”</p><p>I had hit the mark.</p><p>That was the kind of feeling I got from her response.</p><p>There was nothing more to see.</p><p>I walked in long strides towards&nbsp;the wall where swords were being displayed on and pulled one out. The thin blade came out while making a metallic sound. Seeing this, the other maids let out a scream.</p><p>“Before being a peasant, she is my fiancée. With what authority are you mocking someone else’s lover. Am I ridiculous enough for you to mock?”</p><p>“Your highness…… at least this one’s life…… please, spare……”</p><p>It was really hard to understand.</p><p>After falling into this world, only incomprehensible things have been happening.</p><p>Why did&nbsp;people look down on others so easily?</p><p>Why did people not uphold&nbsp;even the least amount of etiquette?</p><p>And finally, why did people attack when they knew they were going to lose?</p><p>They had no caution, they had no common sense, and they had no knowledge. As did Paimon and as did Lodbrok. That old hag shook my insides a few days ago and now this maid was trying to start a fight.</p><p>That was why.</p><p>Since it was full of these kinds of people.</p><p>Because there were only these irresponsible people my siblings and I—.</p><p>Abruptly, choice boxes appeared with a sound effect.</p><p>Ο</p><p>[1. Punish.]</p><p>[2. Spare.]</p><p>Ο</p><p>A half-transparent window that could only be seen by myself.</p><p>I strengthened my grip on the hilt of the sword. The other maids held their breath. The beast girl muttered for forgiveness while shedding tears.</p><p>To kill or not to kill. All kinds of calculations went through my head. The threatened political status for murdering a servant of the governor’s palace. The social impact it would cause. The damage my public image would receive. However, despite considering all these demerits, it was difficult to forgive this girl. It was incredibly difficult. I didn’t clearly know the reason why I couldn’t, but—.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Lord Dantalian.”</p><p>In a subdued</p><p>and always calm tone.</p><p>“That is far enough.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli spoke.</p><p>I slowly turned my head&nbsp;to&nbsp;Lala.</p><p>At that spot were the same eyes which I saw a few days ago.</p><p>The same reproachful gaze that was asking if I did not realize what I had done wrong.</p><p>“……”</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>The inside of my head promptly cooled down.</p><p>I was now able to realize how insane my current actions were. For me to try and kill someone just because they had clicked their tongue once. It was ridiculous.</p><p>The old lady and this maid before me were different. The old lady was the main culprit to have completely ruined Lapis Lazuli’s life. However, all this maid had done was click her tongue. Although she certainly did not know her manners, but that was it. She did not commit a crime that was worth being killed for!</p><p>I semi-forcefully poured ice water into my head.</p><p>‘Calm down.’</p><p>‘Do not make enemies for no reason.’</p><p>‘If they’ve recognized their error,&nbsp;then step back.’</p><p>Behavior procedures engraved like a manual.</p><p>The doctrine that had become nearly instinctive because of my father’s education, started to take effect. 1 second, 2 second, and after the 3rd second I had regained my composure.</p><p>I arduously opened my mouth.</p><p>“……Have you reflected on your actions enough?”</p><p>“Y-Yes! Your highness! This one is terribly sorry! This one will never do it again!”</p><p>“Do not ever forget that emotion. A single mistake could threaten your life.”</p><p>I turned to look at the other maids and spoke.</p><p>“Keep that in mind. As servants like you all who attend to people of high nobility, each and every one of your actions could lead to an irremediable&nbsp;mistake. Your mistakes will soon be the mistake of Niflheim. Your impudence will soon be the impudence of Niflheim. Act with responsibility.”</p><p>The maids all bowed deeply at once.</p><p>“”We shall bear that in mind, your highness!””</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>With this, I had succeeded in giving an evasive response.</p><p>“Good. You may leave now.”</p><p>And then, the maids quickly made their way out.</p><p>Ο</p><p>[1. Punish.]</p><p><strong>[2. Spare.]</strong></p><p>Ο</p><p>The words shined brightly in mid-air.</p><p>Then they broke apart and formed&nbsp;new lines.</p><p><strong>[A kind and merciful decision!]</strong></p><p><strong>[Fame increased slightly.]</strong></p><p>The lines then split apart into small pieces and dispersed like petals.</p><p>I should be delighted that my fame had increased by even a slight amount, but honestly, my current mood was the absolute worst. It was truly at the very bottom. It has been a long time since my mood had been this terrible.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli gazed at me silently.</p><p>The moment our gaze met I instinctively apologized.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“What for?”</p><p>“That’s……”</p><p>I couldn’t answer.</p><p>The feeling of having done something wrong was pressing down against my heart. However, I couldn’t grasp hold of exactly what I had done wrong, not&nbsp;even the smallest amount. This was perplexing.</p><p>Silence went by.</p><p>In the end, Lapis Lazuli let out a sigh.</p><p>“…… Understood.”</p><p>What did she understand?</p><p>She got up from the bed and put her clothes on. After Lapis Lazuli had completely put on her uniform, she lowered her back and bowed. It was a fluid movement without even the slightest bit of error.</p><p>“This one shall make preparations to depart for the slave markets. It should be suitable to hire the Berbere sisters for travel this time as well. Please come out once your highness has finished eating lunch.”</p><p>“Lala.”</p><p>“This one shall take her leave first.”</p><p>Without looking this way, she opened the door and left.</p><p>As I did 4 days ago, I was left in the room alone. Lapis Lazuli may have already been gone, but her rosy scent was still drifting around.</p><p>And then, a notice window.</p><p>Ο</p><p><strong>[Lapis Lazuli’s affection went down by 1.]</strong></p><p>Ο</p><p>“……”</p><p>I silently covered my face with my hands.</p><p>As I lived my life, I belonged to the group&nbsp;of people who were disappointed by others, I was never&nbsp;part of the group&nbsp;who disappointed others.</p><p>But not today.</p><p>I had disappointed Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day 20</p><p>Niflheim, Hermes’ Plaza</p><p>“You know what’s the worst part?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“The fact that I had no idea what I did&nbsp;wrong.”</p><p>Late evening.</p><p>Before I knew it, the scenery&nbsp;outside the window had grown dark.</p><p>Barbatos was looking at me under the quietly shaking candle light.</p><p>As the outside grew darker,&nbsp;the&nbsp;shadow that covered Barbatos’ complexion spread across her face. While supporting her chin with her arm, she silently gazed at me.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“I could at least behave shamelessly if I didn’t feel like I had done something wrong. I could even question the other party about what the problem was. But not me, I understood that I had done something wrong; I just had no idea what that was. And…… that is quite the miserable feeling. Exceedingly……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Tell me. What could Lapis Lazuli have wanted from me?”</p><p>I stared at Barbatos with earnest eyes.</p><p>Barbatos had opened her mouth, but no words came out.</p><p>So there was no other choice but for me to&nbsp;continue talking.</p><p>“Did she want for me to get on my knees and beg? Was that what Lapis wanted from me? For me to throw away my dignity, like a slave. To toss away something like saving face and simply plea?…… That could be it. That was more than possible.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“However, why wouldn’t she even tell me what my wrongdoings were?”</p><p>I grasped my forehead.</p><p>“This drives people mad. Barbatos. This truly is something that drives people mad. Do you know why Lapis didn’t tell me anything?”</p><p>“……I wonder.”</p><p>“There was one reason. Lapis wanted for me to realize my mistake on my own. That if she left it alone then I would figure it out by myself. Lapis had expectations for me. Damn it!”</p><p><em>Thud</em></p><p>I hit the floor.</p><p>“It was insulting and more insulting. Why it was so…… because she was treating me like a fool. Firstly, she was disappointed that I had not realized my wrongdoings. Second, she was hoping that I would figure out what I had done wrong. Do you understand? Hm? Do you understand how shitty this was?”</p><p>I sneered.</p><p>But it didn’t come out properly.</p><p>The sneer came off more as a forced smirk.</p><p>“Lapis was not only judging my current self, but my future self as well. On her own. To her own desire! As if she had me completely figured out! As if, she was considering herself to be standing in a higher position than myself……!”</p><p>I ground my teeth.</p><p>“It was so insulting that I could vomit. It was the first time in my life that I had received this kind of offense. Lapis’ disappointment and expectation became two walls that crushed me even further. In my chest a rage slowly…… an anger slowly built up towards Lapis.”</p><p>“Dantalian.”</p><p>“I made a resolution in my mind.”</p><p>I glared at the candle.</p><p>The candle gave off two colors.</p><p>The upper portion yellow, the bottom portion blue.</p><p>While giving off these colors of light, the light burned and descended down slowly.</p><p>“Get caught once. I will wait until the next time she showed disrespect. &nbsp;And if Lapis irrationally ignored me once more.”</p><p>I grabbed the wick of the candle with my fingers.</p><p>The flame soon flickered and died.</p><p>“—When that happens, I will not stay still.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><hr><p>TL note: Well, I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter.

Myself and my wife.”</p><p>“Hm. We’ll accept 2 gold pieces for the escort fee.”</p><p>I passed 5 gold to the hired soldier and he grinned widely.</p><p>There was an unexpected charm overflowing from the smile of this mercenary who was lacking two front teeth.</p><p>“Thank you very much, your honor. Us mercenaries will protect you with our lives during your stay here. Please have an exciting day with your missus. Ooi, escort this couple to their spot! Make sure it’s of the highest class!”</p><p>“Roger.”</p><p>Outskirts of Pavia.</p><p>Slave merchants had set up stalls throughout the open plains in this area.</p><p>To prevent thieves from pilfering, soldiers were strictly guarding the entire market. There were 5 platforms of various sizes, approximately 70 guards, and market stalls so grand that you’d mistake this place as a military camp if you looked from afar. Most bandits wouldn’t even dare to mess with this market.</p><p>“This way, your honor.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Following the man’s guidance, we went to the center of the market.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli and I were pretending to be a young merchant couple. We had exquisitely forged our identification papers and names. With this, we wouldn’t have to worry about our actual identities being found out any time soon.</p><p>The slave market was overflowing with a shady and damp ambiance.</p><p>“Move it already! You damned dullards.”</p><p>“Snow elves here! Captured straight from the deep snowy mountains in the kingdom of Moscow. As a special occasion, I’ll be displaying them for free today. Please come and take a look!”</p><p>“I told you to walk more quickly!”</p><p>On one side, a guard was swinging a whip and forcing a group of slaves to move. A line of 6 male slaves were chained together and walked forward a little bit at a time. It felt like I was watching a caterpillar.</p><p>“Please look as much as you want. Looking is free!”</p><p>On another side, a naked elf was locked up behind iron bars. A sales promoter kept going on about how amazing his ‘product’ was while pointing at the elf’s breasts and ribs. There were many people gathered around the iron cage, and there were even kids among them. Little girls were sticking their heads through the bars and staring at the bare elf.</p><p>I could hear their conversation.</p><p>“Big sis, is it true that elves live off of only drinking dew?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Uhm, I don’t think she understands what we’re saying. I don’t know how to speak the language used in Moscow, too……”</p><p>“They say that elves drink the raw blood of kids every year. That’s why they stay pretty for a hundred and two hundred years.”</p><p>“You idiot! Don’t lie!”</p><p>The group of little girls giggled. The elf smiled softly as she watched the kids. When the children reached their hands out, the elf more than gladly put her arm out to let them touch her skin. Although the elf’s arm was thin and mostly bones, the little girls were making a commotion as if they were touching something like gold.</p><p>“These mischievous kids!”</p><p>The sales person lifted the children up while laughing heartily.</p><p>“You can’t touch the product thoughtlessly like that!”</p><p>I watched up to that point and turned away.</p><p>—Kuaaaaaaah……</p><p>The sound of a whip lashing and a slave screaming could be heard in the distance, and yet no one in the market area paid it any mind. The only ones to pay attention to the screaming were the kids. Each time they heard a moan, the children would get excited and ask “Did you hear that? Did you hear that?”. Every time they heard a scream, they would echo the sound with their own voices shouting “Kaah!” “Kueeak!”.</p><p>Was it because of their innocence, perhaps?</p><p>I muttered.</p><p>“This is quite the splendid place. Are all slave markets like this?”</p><p>“Yes. There are not a lot of differences.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli responded.</p><p>“The slave market that this one was indebted to for a short period of time, during this one’s childhood, had the same feeling as this.”</p><p>“What? You worked at a slave market before?”</p><p>“To be precise, this one did not work at a slave market, but wanted to become a slave instead. At the time, this one was incredibly famished. This one had thought that as long as this one was able to obtain a meal, then it would be fine to become a slave. Since slaves were at least fed.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli spoke calmly.</p><p>“However, once the slave merchant found out that this one was a half-breed, he had chased this one out. Apparently, outcasts did not have the ‘right’ to become a product to be dealt in. Regardless, before this one’s identity was revealed, this one was able to eat half of a stale bread. It is a good memory.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“……”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli’s past was so dark that it was scary……</p><p>Doing whatever I could to change the topic, I cleared my throat.</p><p>“The succubus that used to wander these market grounds is now the mistress of a Demon Lord. Is that not splendid, Lala? A person’s worth is not determined by their birth. You, who was able to overcome all kinds of unfavorable conditions, have the most beautiful value out of them all.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli gave me a side glance.</p><p>“……Your highness sure does make surprising remarks occasionally.”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“It is nothing. Your highness had complimented that this one had succeeded, but that is woefully inadequate. Until your highness has become a true ruler of demons, until that moment is when this one’s success can be put up for debate.”</p><p>“You are quite the greedy woman.”</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>“That’s why I like you.”</p><p>“There is nothing for your highness to be flattering this one for.”</p><p>“I am not hoping for much. I would simply like it if there was more charm mixed in tonight’s affairs. In the first place, when we do ‘that’ your face is so stonelike that it’s rather fun to……”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli stepped on my right foot. The heel of her shoe was stabbing into the bridge of my foot so it hurt quite a lot, but in contrast, I felt delighted.</p><p>Yes. This was the same Lapis Lazuli as usual. The same Lapis Lazuli that was cool-headed, calm, and would react moderately to my teasing. Feeling a rare sense of relief from that, I unpacked my things at the quarters that the hired soldiers had guided us to.</p><p>That night, we had received an invitation to a banquet with the slave merchants.</p><p>It was worth giving that soldier 5 gold. The people on the market’s side had recognized us as VIPs and had given us an invitation.</p><p>I wonder if it was because the banquet was for slave merchants, but the gathering was rather extravagant. There were several guards standing as security and beautiful slaves were serving the food in the nude. I had soon mixed in with the group of merchants and chatted with them.</p><p>Alcohol went around appropriately. It was just the right amount for people to become intoxicated. During this sort of ambitious night, this was the most appropriate time to induce people into confessing their inner-thoughts. Now, shall we get down to the point……?</p><p>“This is the first time in my life seeing such a luxurious slave market. I have been to several slave markets in the past that were of a larger scale, but if you compared the quality of the products between here and there, they can’t possibly match with the excellence here. It is wonderful, everyone. I am truly moved.”</p><p>“Haha. You’re thinking too highly of us.”</p><p>The slave merchants laughed with bright red faces.</p><p>An enlivened mood flowed throughout the room. Everyone gave a favorable impression. For people who dealt in slaves, it was hard to believe how harmless these people appeared. Did they not even have the slightest amount of guilt for selling slaves?</p><p>Well, that was probably how the people of this current age were like. This wasn’t an issue that I should get involved with. Revolutions should be left in the hands of revolutionaries, and politics should be left in the hands of politicians. That was my creed. Albeit, there were many people who got these two jobs mixed up.</p><p>“There is something that I am slightly curious about, though.”</p><p>“What is it? Tell us.”</p><p>“Like how a single flower could overwhelm an entire ballroom of people, would there not be a slave with the highest value in this market as well? What does everyone here consider to be the flower of this market?”</p><p>The merchants looked at each after hearing my question.</p><p>Shortly after, they started to make a commotion.</p><p>“Of course, would it not be the snow elf that I captured from Moscow? I had to hire no less than 20 hunters just to catch that bugger. There is no doubt that my product is the best.”</p><p>“Pfft. Honestly, the elf trend is already over. These days, sirens and mermaids are the big thing. In that sense, the siren that I went through a lot of trouble getting my hands on……”</p><p>“Ha! How could some beast with wings cause any fuss? It’d be a doubtful if you could even get 20 gold off them. They may be a rare species and appropriate for livening up the atmosphere, but you can’t call them the leading star of the market. That’s for certain.”</p><p>“No, of course you should rate them higher based on their rarity. I’m actually thinking of putting out my ace in the hole and showcase a centaur. If it’s a horse than the noble ladies would……”</p><p>They clamored.</p><p>The argument on whose slave was better continued on.</p><p>After a while, a slave merchant pointed towards a young man and spoke.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“How about your side, Giacomo? I heard you really resolved yourself to prepare a product for this time.</p><p>“……It’s not as great as everyone else’s list of goods.”</p><p>The young man furrowed his brows as he responded.</p><p>He was the young man who had been silently drinking wine throughout the entire banquet. Although the other merchant was trying to bring attention to his slave, he had refused. Seeing the way his complexion had darkened, it appeared as if he was displeased about something.</p><p>“To say it’s nothing great! That’s quite modest of you!”</p><p>“That’s right, Giacomo. We aren’t deaf, we heard the rumors. We heard that you succeeded in obtaining the illegitimate child from a Duke’s family.”</p><p>The youngster made a bitter expression.</p><p>It seemed he was uncomfortable that the attention was focused onto him.</p><p>“……I was lucky. That is all.”</p><p>The man then tipped his wine glass.</p><p>I furtively curled the edges of my mouth as I stared at the young man.</p><p>Found him.</p><p>I was certain that that man was the slave merchant who was in possession of Laura De Farnese.</p><p>Enduring my laziness to participate in this banquet was worth it. To be able to find my target so quickly. I was lucky.</p><p>Acting surprised, I raised my voice.</p><p>“Wait, everyone. The illegitimate child from a Duke’s family? What is that about? I’d like to hear more details.”</p><p>“I’m not sure, but that fellow, Giacomo, obtained quite the prize at such a young age. It’s that guy’s first time debuting in the slave market industry, but my God, he got his hands on a product that’s a big shot among big shots!”</p><p>“They say it’s the illegitimate child from Duke Farnese’s House.”</p><p>The merchants got excited and started to make a big fuss.</p><p>“A duke’s family. And not some small family, but the Farnese family! Naturally, their status did indeed drop to the rock bottom after losing in the last War of Roses, but still……”</p><p>“Well, it’s an open secret. They probably didn’t want to shift the responsibility for their defeat to one of their actual heirs. So they sold off their illegitimate daughter as a compromise. Although, this is merely in the field of speculations.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t that probably be the right guess? Other possibilities are impossible…… That missy was selected as a scapegoat for the family.”</p><p>Someone clicked their tongue.</p><p>“The ones that came out on top after the War of Roses are happy they got to dishonor the Farnese family, and the Farnese family is happy that they were able to lower their losses to a minimum.”</p><p>“If you look carefully, those noble folks are better at business than we are. Keke. Those people on top sure know their stuff.”</p><p>“Furthermore, they say that ‘that’ isn’t a joke.”</p><p>A merchant mentioned while chewing on a chicken leg.</p><p>I put a fascinated expression on my face.</p><p>“What do you mean by ‘that’?”</p><p>“That, I’m talking about that. Her face and body are just so……kuuh!”</p><p>The merchant laughed wickedly. Sticky brown sauce was smeared all over his fingers. The other merchants agreed enthusiastically.</p><p>“I heard that rumor too. That she was the confined princess of Farnese!”</p><p>“Yeah. That because she was a woman of peerless beauty, they were afraid that it would cause a disturbance in the kingdom. That’s why the duke purposely hid her away in the deepest part of the mansion so no one could see her.”</p><p>“Well, honestly, it’s probably a bunch of lies.”</p><p>The merchants shrugged.</p><p>“No matter how you looked at it, they probably hid her because they were ashamed…… But what does that matter? Just the mere fact that those kinds of rumors came attached with her is special. Rumors raise the value of the product, after all.”</p><p>“Mm. I guess that’s right. For starters, she’s from one of the most noble families in the kingdom……”</p><p>“The rumor that she was the most beautiful girl on the continent went around once.”</p><p>“And she’s at the ripe age of 16!”</p><p>The merchants broke out into laughter all together.</p><p>The only person unable to go along with the mood was the young man. He had maintained a stoic face.</p><p>“…… Please excuse my going first. Good night.”</p><p>The man stood from the table and casually walked out.</p><p>The other merchants wished him a good night as well, but the young man received it absently. It’d be hard to look at it as a positive behaviour. Once the youngster was gone, the other merchants immediately voiced their opinions.</p><p>“Isn’t he acting a bit arrogantly? We invited everyone of the same trade like this so we could get to know our colleagues better, but if he behaves like that……”</p><p>“He really has no manners. He’s just running wild while relying on his father’s reputation. All the young folk are like that these days.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>It seems the way young people behaved in this world and my original world was the same.</p><p>I put on a smile and stood up.</p><p>“I wish to look around the marketplace early in the morning, so I shall be returning to my quarters for the day as well. Everyone, please have a pleasant night.”</p><p>“Ooh. Sleep well.”</p><p>After receiving the farewells from the merchants, I made my way out of the banquet hall. After instructing Lala to go outside the marketplace and prepare for any situation, I chased after the young man by myself. Not having gone far, the sight of the young man walking through the marketplace by himself came into view.</p><p>“Sir Giacomo. Sir Giacomo!”</p><p>“Yes……?”</p><p>The youngster turned to look at me.</p><p>He had eyes that appeared as if he was looking at a suspicious person.</p><p>I put a broad smile on my face.</p><p>“Would you, perhaps, like to share a conversation with myself?”</p><p>Let’s soften up this novice.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>▯Methoranum Peddler, Slaver Merchant, Giacomo Petrarch Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day 10 Kingdom of Sardinia, Pavia Slave Market In one corner of the market area, I was drinking beer with a strange peddler.</p><p>It was weird. I couldn’t really remember how I ended up drinking like this. It sort of felt like I had been possessed. Well, there are days in your life where you just blank out……</p><p>“I’m only telling you this, Sir Giacomo.”</p><p>The strange man in front of me made a bitter smile.</p><p>“To tell you the truth, the very act of selling and buying slaves is discomforting for me. It feels like I’m doing a crime against humanity.”</p><p>“Is that so? I think so as well.”</p><p>I happily responded to his remark. This was it. It was because of this characteristic of this man, that naturally made us start drinking together. I wonder if it was a coincidence or pure luck, but the wavelength between the man in front of me and myself was surprisingly good.</p><p>“Originally, I didn’t want to be something like a slave dealer. However, my father pressured me into it. He said that if I wanted to become a veteran merchant quickly, then there was no better job than a slave dealer……”</p><p>“You have a good father. But, there are many things in the world that are more precious than becoming a veteran. It would have been nice if your father had realized that.”</p><p>“That’s what I’ve been saying!”</p><p>Oh dear, I unintentionally raised my voice.</p><p>But it wasn’t strange. It was the first time I had ever met a person who connected with me so well, and in the center of the slave market at that. Was this not quite the eccentric encounter?</p><p>“My father is too attached to money. Yes, a merchant’s job is to make money and transport goods. I don’t have a problem up to that point…… But, aren’t slaves people too? Be it humans, elves, or sirens…… to treat them like some exhibit……”</p><p>“I understand. Ah, I see your cup is empty. Here, have another glass.”</p><p>“Thank you……”</p><p>I gulped down the wine that the man poured me. I felt a very pleasant drunkenness rising. It seems I really needed a person that I could openly talk to. It felt like I was drinking more heavily than usual, but it was okay. This was within my acceptable range.</p><p>And thus, time flowed. Before I knew it, I found myself leading the man to the quarters on my platform. ……Huh, why did I bring him here?</p><p>“How marvelous. To refrain from putting chains on most of your slaves, that is quite the humane consideration you hold for them.”</p><p>The man looked on in admiration at the slaves on the wagons.</p><p>Aah, that’s right. I remembered now. He asked if he could take a look at my slaves and I had gladly accepted his request. Even though you aren’t allowed to bring guests into this area…… It shouldn’t be too much of a problem, right? This person wasn’t a simple guest, he was my friend. Now that I think about it, what was his name again?</p><p>“The majority of people only talk about it but never try it themselves. You are different, Giacomo. You are truly treating your slaves with warmth. I can see that with my own eyes. It is splendid.”</p><p>“Ahaha, you’re exaggerating.”</p><p>Oh well, something like names weren’t important. The most important part when judging a person was by their personality. This man was okay to be trusted. He possessed a good personality.</p><p>“Except, I don’t think every single slave would be satisfied.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>What could he be talking about?</p><p>It may not be a boast, but in my opinion, there was no other merchant that showed concern for their slaves as much as I did. I regularly gave them two meals a day, and obviously, the slaves liked me as well. But to say that they weren’t satisfied……</p><p>“Oh dear, that was rude of me. I was simply thinking while in the slaves’ perspective.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The man smiled softly.</p><p>“Before being captured by us, did these slaves not live a rather peaceful life? They must have been able to move around freely and live their lives to their desire. I felt that they’d most certainly still have some dissatisfaction even if they were to receive their meals on time.”</p><p>“Think in the slave’s perspective……”</p><p>It was surprising. I had never considered this before.</p><p>I’m a free man and they’re slaves. We were clearly different. There was no reason for me to be forcing my own thoughts onto them when they were completely different from myself. But I had regarded it like that……</p><p>That it was more than enough to treat them with just the slightest bit of consideration. To think in the slave’s perspective? Was that possible? Was that not an excessively idealistic way of thinking……?</p><p>“How is it actually?”</p><p>While I was receiving a shock from the man’s words, he threw a question at me.</p><p>I perked up in alarm. What were we talking about? I couldn’t remember the context of our conversation. My head felt dizzy since awhile ago.</p><p>“What is actually……?”</p><p>“I’m referring to Miss Farnese. Have you already forgotten?”</p><p>Farnese? Was he talking about Miss Laura De Farnese?</p><p>No, since that family was deprived of their noble peerage, I couldn’t call her by using that family name anymore. But I couldn’t clearly remember if we really did have that kind of conversation. Oh dear, I think I drank way too much.</p><p>The man calmly explained.</p><p>“Did I not ask if Miss Farnese was satisfied with her life as a slave? Once I did, you, Sir Giacomo, said that you would personally show her to me.”</p><p>“Ah. That’s right. That’s right…… I forgot for a second.”</p><p>I still didn’t feel certain while I was responding.</p><p>Miss Farnese was a valuable of the highest quality. In order to prevent thieves from stealing her, I had hidden her at the deepest part of my platform. Even if he was my friend, I couldn’t show it to him lightly. I was starting to regret it. How could I have made such an irresponsible promise……</p><p>The other party immediately noticed my complexion and spoke.</p><p>“I see. It seems you’re actually conflicted to show her to me.”</p><p>“No, the truth is.”</p><p>“It is fine. Please do not feel any pressure from this. I was merely suggesting this with a light heart. I was just curious as to how you truly handled your slaves, and how your slaves sincerely felt towards you.”</p><p>The man smiled bitterly and muttered.</p><p>“I am the one who should be apologizing. Due to my curiosity, I had ended up forcing Sir Giacomo into a delicate situation. Let us return to the pub.”</p><p>“Ah……”</p><p>After seeing the man’s forlorn expression, an indescribable guilt built up in my chest. It was that. The other party had merely requested something of me while thinking of me as a friend. But what was I doing?</p><p>In the end, was I not treating him like a stranger? What made me different from those people at the banquet hall who whipped their slaves? I was the worst. If those merchants were the villains, then I was nothing more than a mere hypocrite.</p><p>“……No. Please wait. I shall guide you to where Miss Farnese is at.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>The man blinked his eyes in surprise.</p><p>“Is that truly okay?”</p><p>“Of course. There’s no problem if we’re to simply look and come back. Thankfully, Miss Farnese does not sleep at night, so it should be fine to visit now.”</p><p>“…… Sir Giacomo. If you feel any difficulty from my request, then you may refuse at any time.”</p><p>The man was giving me a worried look.</p><p>“It may have only been a few hours since we have met, Sir Giacomo, but I feel a friendship between us. I do not wish to burden a friend.”</p><p>I was moved by his consideration. I told him that it was okay, but the man was still being considerate of me and was trying to refuse. What was I possibly hesitating for in front of such a good-natured person!</p><p>A smile naturally formed on my lips; the touch of anxiety that remained in my chest had melted away like snow.</p><p>“No, it’s fine. I, myself, also want to hear Miss Farnese’s opinion. If anything, I’d like to request for you to come with me. If it’s possible for me to think while in the slaves’ position…… the things that I have been lacking up till now. I wish to discuss this with you.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>The man’s eyes widened.</p><p>Until eventually, he smiled. It was a very soft smile.</p><p>“Giacomo. You know how to respect others. That is a precious ability that comes from your heart. It’s not something just anyone can learn. I truly respect you.”</p><p>I was at a loss for words from his straightforward compliment.</p><p>Although I wasn’t able to say anything and my mouth was hanging agape, the man was simply smiling at me in silence. As if he was telling me that he understood everything about me…… No, it was as if he understood the amount of appreciation that I desired from the world, it was that kind of smile.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Ah, well uh. You know.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The man grinned.</p><p>“Go ahead, Sir Giacomo.”</p><p>“That is…… T-This way. Please follow me.”</p><p>Feeling embarrassed, words wouldn’t come out properly.</p><p>For some reason, I felt too shy to look him in the face. Yes, it was because I was drunk. My emotions were going on and off because of the intoxication. There was no meaning beyond that. None at all. Really.</p><p>My head slowly became dizzier. It was becoming harder to keep myself steady. Even if I tried to pass it on while regarding it as my imagination, my vision was throbbing too much. It was weird. I shouldn’t be this weak to alcohol.</p><p>“J-Just a little further.”</p><p>My words started to become strained. My consciousness quickly drifted away.</p><p>“Just a little bit more and the cell that the Miss is confined in……”</p><p>“It’s alright, Giacomo.”</p><p>The man lightly supported myself, who was swaying left and right.</p><p>Once I rested my head on the man’s body, all my strength left my body.</p><p>While my eyes started to close slowly, I could hear the man’s voice.</p><p>“It seems you drank a bit too much tonight. I shall take responsibility and carry Sir Giacomo back to your quarters. That’s why, please rest easy.”</p><p>A voice that sounded like a mother’s lullaby.</p><p>Feeling comfort from that, I closed my eyes.</p><p>Despite the fact that the inside of my head was all disorganized, there was one truth that I was certain of. I had gained a friendship that would last forever……</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day 10 Kingdom of Sardinia, Pavia Slave Market Well then, that was a breeze.</p><p>I laid the young man down on the floor and smiled wryly.</p><p>“You shouldn’t trust a person like me so easily, friend.”</p><p>I had effortlessly conquered this youngster who appeared to be around 19 years old. I had merely complimented him moderately, but he got excited on his own and crossed over willingly. It was so easy that it was ridiculous. Was it thanks to my talent, or was it because this fellow was excessively pure as a merchant……?</p><p>Of course, the answer was because I was talented.</p><p>I knew that very well.</p><p>If I ever spoke modestly then it was simply because of etiquette.</p><p>Additionally, his affection went up by an outrageous amount.</p><p>We had only spent 2 hours drinking together, but his affection points had shot past the 10s, breached through the 20s, and lastly reached the 30s. And yet, Lapis Lazuli’s affection was still at 10. Why was it that I received more affection from men than I did women? It must be the end of the world.</p><p>“Status.”</p><p>After muttering the word under my breath, a hologram appeared before me.</p><p>A type of status window that only appeared if the affection was over 20.</p><p>Name: Giacomo Petrarch Race: Human Job: Merchant(E) Reputation: Previously Failed Scholar Ο Leadership: F Ο Might: F Ο Intelligence: E Politics: F Ο Charm: C Ο Technique: F Ο Affection: 32 Ο Current Mental State: ‘Friend……’</p><p>What an adorable nature this is.</p><p>In a certain meaning, instead of a girl like Lapis Lazuli, whose intentions I couldn’t even begin to grasp, these kinds of people were considerably more complacent.</p><p>A type of person who did their best to respect others, despite being weak-minded and slightly naive.</p><p>Most people may ridicule these kinds of people as pushovers.</p><p>But at the very least, I didn’t.</p><p>If anything, I slightly envied them.</p><p>……Because I could never become like them.</p><p>“Just think of it as being caught up with a rotten person.”</p><p>I searched through Giacomo’s coat until I got my hands on a bunch of keys.</p><p>The keys made a metallic jingle as I took them out. The key to Laura De Farnese’s cell was most likely among these.</p><p>Stealing is wrong? That’s a given. I’m a bad person, so I did something like stealing normally.</p><p>I sold off something like guilt a long time ago.</p><p>As I lived my life, I came to the realization that the need to carry around something like that was non-existent.</p><p>I’m not sure what a masochist, who enjoyed receiving pain, would think. As a healthy and sensible sadist, I was out of the question.</p><p>“Mmmm……”</p><p>Giacomo Petrich let out a sound while in his sleep.</p><p>Since I had laced his beer with rather strong sleeping pills, he was going to be snoring away like that for a while.</p><p>I patted Giacomo’s head.</p><p>“Sleep well. Laura De Farnese is an individual that is too much for someone as good-natured as you to handle. All you have to do is dream happily and leave her in my hands.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“It’d be more beneficial for Laura De Farnese, for you, and for me. You did nothing wrong.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I wonder if he was able to hear my words while unconscious.</p><p>Giacomo Petrich’s face slowly became relaxed.</p><p>The sound of deep breathing flowed from between his lips.</p><p>Good.</p><p>The sweet child has closed his eyes.</p><p>It was time for the utterly crooked individuals to skulk around like specters in the night.</p><p>Holding the keys in my hand, I walked forward. My destination soon came into view. Between two wooden wagons an iron cage resided.</p><p>The moonlight gently poured down.</p><p>Despite the iron bars being bathed under the moonlight, it did not shine but withdrew further into darkness instead. It was as if it repudiated anything on the outside from approaching it, even mere luminescence.</p><p>There was a separate thing that was being shined upon by the light. It was not the cage, but rather the girl who was trapped within.</p><p>The girl was wearing dirty rags similar to what a beggar would wear. It must have been several days since she was able to last wash, since there was dirt smeared over her skin here and there.</p><p>And then, the moon in the night sky was covered by clouds for a slight moment before reappearing once more. The moonlight descended again upon the girl’s skin making her shine brightly.</p><p>“……”</p><p>I unintentionally held my breath.</p><p>Whoever were to come, they would all be overwhelmed by this girl’s beauty.</p><p>However, the reason why I had my breath taken away from me for an instant was not because of this girl’s beauty. Something completely different had moved me emotionally.</p><p>—The slave girl was reading a book.</p><p>In the middle of this boundlessly dreary cage.</p><p>Using the moon as her only source of light.</p><p>With a thick book spread open on the floor before her, she silently turned the pages with her blistered hands.</p><p>There was something breathtaking about this extraordinary sight.</p><p>If one were to ask why, then it was because there was absolutely nothing that could get in her way.</p><p>This may have been my first time seeing her, but I immediately understood everything.</p><p>The disgrace and shame from having fallen from nobility and into slavery, the countless number of times people had beaten and hurled abuses at this girl, the despair and sorrow for being thrown away by her own parents. Miscellaneous emotions had absolutely no effect on her now.</p><p>She was already a completed human.</p><p>Closed off.</p><p>In darkness.</p><p>“……”</p><p>I approached the cage with loud steps.</p><p>Despite having purposely made my footsteps resound, the girl did not raise her head.</p><p>She simply stared down with no expression on her face.</p><p>Was she so focused on the book that she couldn’t hear any outside noise?</p><p>I stepped between the moon and girl.</p><p>A dark shadow loomed over her. Now, for the first time, the girl slowly raised her head to match my gaze, with eyes that lacked even the smallest amount of light.</p><p>Laura De Farnese.</p><p>The human to go against the hero and turn the continent into a sea of blood.</p><p>To the girl who was abandoned by her family and the world, I spoke.</p><p>“—My name is Dantalian, the rank 71st Demon Lord.”</p><p>Without any pretense.</p><p>Petty tricks didn’t work against people with these kinds of eyes.</p><p>Always straight and honest, that was the best persuasion method in this sort of situation.</p><p>“De Farnese. I came here in order to obtain you.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“I am wealthy. Thus I can easily buy you at the slave auction whenever I please. My witches and military troops are lying in wait around this marketplace, thus taking you away by force is also fully a possibility.”</p><p>It was not a lie.</p><p>Around this time, Lapis Lazuli was most likely preparing to start an assault at the outskirts of the market. The Berbere Sisters were with her. My forces were waiting at a moment’s notice.</p><p>11 witches of the highest class, and 9 soldiers of the highest class.</p><p>The defenses of this slave market was comparatively sturdy, but it was still nothing more than 70 guards. Utilizing the witch’s firepower, we could easily turn them all into grilled meat. Snatching Laura De Farnese away and disappearing leisurely was not difficult.</p><p>If I were to give the order then it was simple.</p><p>Despite that.</p><p>“But I desire to be acknowledged by you.”</p><p>I wanted to leave those as a last resort.</p><p>%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-2-page-113</p><p>“Not by wealth or by force. Purely person to person, I wish to be accepted by you. Please judge me with your dim eyes. Determine if I possess the caliber to take you in. Evaluate myself factually.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Can you allow me the opportunity to take your test?”</p><p>A stillness settled over us.</p><p>The girl gazed vacantly at me.</p><p>We didn’t avoid each other’s gaze. Until the third cloud had covered the moon, time flowed silently.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The girl moved her lips.</p><p>“—Stop blocking the moonlight and move aside.”</p><p>It was an inorganic voice.</p><p>Like a machine unnaturally trying to imitate a human’s voice.</p><p>Regardless, I nodded.</p><p>In this location, this girl had perfectly established her own kingdom. The book was her everything. Thus, the act of covering the light meant that I was invading her kingdom. I promptly complied to Miss Farnese’s request and stepped slightly to the side.</p><p>Miss Farnese nodded.</p><p>“I express my thanks. You are a gentle person.”</p><p>“Respecting another’s domain is a basic, after all. Even if you were to become my vassal, I shall always respect your will like I have done now.”</p><p>“Vassal?”</p><p>Miss Farnese tilted her head.</p><p>“Not claiming as a sex slave, but as a vassal instead?”</p><p>“That is so. If I wanted to treat you like a slave, then I would have bought you with gold or have undertaken action in a violent fashion. But I judged that wealth and power was not required to persuade you. Laura De Farnese. I purely wish to obtain you.”</p><p>“If that was a love confession just now, then this young lady would surely have been moved.”</p><p>Miss Farnese placed her hand on her chin.</p><p>Referentially, Laura De Farnese had spoken in 4 different languages. Sardinian, Habsburgian, Franconian, and Ancient Helasian. It wasn’t merely a simple conversation. She was testing me on how far I could keep up with her.</p><p>I easily passed her fundamental test. No matter where I was, if it involved languages then I couldn’t be brought down. If anything, I was rather self-confident that this was my specialty. From this point on was the main event.</p><p>“I am honestly thankful for your offer. The only other remaining fate left for this young lady is most likely being sold off to some wealthy noble and living a life as a tool for sexual release.”</p><p>“Aah. That is correct.”</p><p>Due to the information that I was able to obtain in&nbsp;, I had a general outline of what Laura De Farnese’s destiny was. It should be fine to mention future events briefly here.</p><p>“The person to buy you in the auction will be Count Roswell from the Kingdom of Brittany. Publicly, he is praised as a man with a noble personality, but in truth, he is a sadistic pervert.”</p><p>“Hou.”</p><p>Did I pique her curiosity? Miss Farnese showed an interested response. Although, her eyes were still dim.</p><p>“Tell me in more details.”</p><p>“With pleasure. Count Roswell considers locking up fallen nobles, like yourself, in his underground torture chamber as a joy in life. Because his preferences are so vast, he enjoys things from candle wax torture to amputation.”</p><p>“Amputation? What is that?”</p><p>“There are many types of perverts in the world, Miss De Farnese.”</p><p>I smiled gently.</p><p>“Among them, there are a type of people who gain carnal desires for women with their legs and arms cut off.”</p><p>I always felt satisfaction whenever I was able to reveal the cruel reality to a girl who was ignorant of the world. You could say that it felt like I was helping a bit in that child’s education.</p><p>I’m a friendly man, after all.</p><p>“If you were to be sold off to Count Roswell, then there is no doubt that you will be gang raped in a prison cell, where even sunlight cannot reach, for 10 years. If you are unlucky, then you may experience abortion several times as well.”</p><p>“That is indeed the worst individual to become a slave of. I can endure being tortured by candle wax, but this young lady does not think she could possibly manage having her limbs severed.”</p><p>“Is it because you will be unable to read books?”</p><p>“Yes. I’ll be unable to read books without my limbs.”</p><p>Miss Farnese answered seriously.</p><p>I had assumed she was this kind of girl.</p><p>“But, oh Demon Lord. It’s rather hard to believe that you’re planning to use this young lady for something other than a sex slave. As you can see, this young lady is quite beautiful. Even if you were to take myself in as a vassal, how could this young lady be certain that you won’t be captivated by this lady’s looks later on and violate her?”</p><p>It was a Missy who said nonsensical things as if it was natural.</p><p>Being slightly put off, I creased my brows.</p><p>“……You. Do you, perhaps, often hear from others that you’re very conceited?”</p><p>“Pardon me. I am simply evaluating my own beauty objectively. Throughout my life, 4 times from my own father, 11 times from my half-brothers, and 2 times from my half-sisters, this young lady had almost been raped by them. This lady’s beauty is most certainly out of the ordinary. It is quite unfortunate.”</p><p>“What? You were almost raped by your half-sisters?”</p><p>Even the Demon Lord was surprised by this.</p><p>Miss Farnese spoke bluntly.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“There are many types of perverts in the world, oh Demon Lord. Among them are women who feel carnal desire for people of the same-sex. Adding to that, there are also women who have an incestuous desire for people of the same blood.”</p><p>Her line had the exact same cadence as what I had said earlier while trying to show off. It was her counterattack to me for having behaved like a grown-up.</p><p>I unintentionally ended up admiring this girl’s wit.</p><p>“……Impressive.”</p><p>“You do not have to compliment this young lady, since this young lady had come to terms with her own genius when she was 6 years old.”</p><p>“Oh, really? What a coincidence. The time I realized that I was a prodigy was at the age of 6 as well.”</p><p>“Mm, is that so? This young lady should add that she had become self-aware of her own superiority in intellect after having witnessed her siblings struggling to master a single geometry theorem even after the age of 10.”</p><p>“I became self-aware after seeing that my younger half-siblings were unable to learn even 2 languages by the age of 5.”</p><p>“Aah. It’s certainly difficult to understand why people struggle with foreign languages. Do you not naturally master a language after listening to it for half a year?”</p><p>“Precisely so. It’s something that I can’t understand.”</p><p>“Whenever this young lady sees a group of people confused about the simplest of truth, while this lady feels sadness and pity for them, at the same time this young lady feels more suspicion instead. How could they have possibly lived for this long with that kind of head? If this young lady was ever to be in their position, this young lady would have immediately killed herself.”</p><p>“The majority of people are born pitiful. It can’t be helped. There’s no other choice but for people like us to politely teach them what intelligence and etiquette are.”</p><p>“Oh Demon Lord. Is that not a tedious task?”</p><p>“It is incredibly tedious. However, despite everything, we are still a part of the community that resides on this world. Very occasionally, we need to know how to sacrifice ourselves for a good cause.”</p><p>“By ‘very occasionally’, do you mean once in a lifetime?”</p><p>“If it’s that much then that’s more than enough—”</p><p>Ah!</p><p>I involuntarily got absorbed into the conversation.</p><p>The expression that I had put on for acting purposes had grown faint at some point.</p><p>The chemistry between myself and this girl was good beyond imagination.</p><p>“Oh, right. Furthermore, this young lady occasionally does not speak and goes into her own world for an entire week. If we are to spend time together, then please take this into account.”</p><p>“Ah, I too occasionally shut myself in my bed and refuse to come out for 4 days at a time. On those occasions, I do hope that you will respect my personal life.”</p><p>“Of course. Also, this young lady tends to play the violin very loudly. Additionally, there are times this young lady will be driven by her enthusiasm and begin to sing as well. So if you are to live with this young lady, then you must consider this as well.”</p><p>“Violins are the pleasure of life.”</p><p>I nodded my head earnestly.</p><p>“Oh, do you think so?”</p><p>“The melody from a harpsichord flows too stiffly, so it gives off a strong mechanical feeling. But do violins not express the intense vibrations of life? Music is vibrations, and nothing besides vibrations. An oboe is quite marvelous as well, but if you were to compare the two, then the violin would still be on top.”</p><p>“This young lady agrees entirely.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>We stared at each other.</p><p>I carefully opened my mouth.</p><p>“Say. I’m not sure if it’s a misunderstanding, but……”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“I’m not sure why, but it feels like you and I will be able to get along quite peacefully.”</p><p>“What a peculiar coincidence. This young lady shares the same opinion.”</p><p>“This may be abrupt, but I have a few questions. Who is the most intelligent person in the world?”</p><p>The girl promptly answered.</p><p>“Of course, it is the individuals, themselves.”</p><p>“What about a person who irresponsibly throws aside a promise and disregards others?”</p><p>“It’d only be appropriate to immediately cut off their limbs and sentence them to death.”</p><p>“When you see a person who is pure, what thought crosses your mind?”</p><p>“How they could possibly live life so foolishly, but at the same time, this young lady is also blinded by their pureness and can’t help but admit that they are a race more superior than this young lady.”</p><p>“What is love?”</p><p>“A suicidal act of ruin disguised as romance.”</p><p>“What is friendship?”</p><p>“The emotion that this young lady randomly grants people who do not bother her.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“What is labour?”</p><p>“Proof that God does not exist in this world, and that it’d only be appropriate for it to be eradicated.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>The girl and I nodded at the same time.</p><p>You could readily say that it was a fateful nod.</p><p>“Miss De Farnese. I personally dislike a child-like body. I feel more sexual appeal from women with more robust breasts. So thankfully, the chances of myself being captivated by you is incredibly low.”</p><p>“Oh Demon Lord. This young lady prefers men who are well advanced in years, so at the very least 50, but if possible 60 years of age. This young lady detests men without any wrinkles. A man’s charm solely comes from their years of experience, thus, the chances of this young lady being seduced by you is very slim.”</p><p>We reached out our arms and grabbed each other’s hand tightly.</p><p>“—Perfect.”</p><p>“—Splendid.”</p><p>This had long ago transcended being compatible or not.</p><p>I was her other half, and she was my other half. We were born on the same planet, but due to the whim of the Gods, we were separated. Until finally, we were able to reunite with one another here today. There may have been an age difference between us, but that was no problem. A companion that shared the same ideology was something that overcame generations and age. The decalcomania soul of mine which I couldn’t find in my original world was now before me.</p><p>A sound effect rang and a notice window appeared.</p><p>Ο</p><p>[You’ve sincerely reached a communion with the other party.]</p><p>[Laura De Farnese’s affection went up by 15.]</p><p>Ο</p><p>In a single burst the affection points broke past 10.</p><p>It took no more than 150 days just to raise Lapis Lazuli’s affection up to 10, however it only took 15 minutes in Laura De Farnese’s case. What was with this difference in degree?</p><p>I see.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli was indeed a special case.</p><p>I used the key to unlock the cage while being pleased by my own competence.</p><p>With a clunk, the cage door opened. After undoing the metal collar around Miss Farnese’s neck, every problem was now beautifully taken care of.</p><p>“Mmm. This is refreshing.”</p><p>Miss Farnese walked out from the cage. She then spread her arms out towards the moon in the night sky. It appeared as if she was trying to measure how much of the sky she could capture into her arms.</p><p>Time flowed like that for a long time.</p><p>Shortly after, De Farnese turned her body towards me.</p><p>“—Lord.”</p><p>She lowered herself to one knee.</p><p>“As long as your lordship does not betray this young lady first, she shall follow your commands loyally. As long as your lordship respects this young lady, she shall devote her soul to you. Laura De Farnese. As the third daughter of the Duchy of Parma and the rightful heir of Piacenza, on this night, continental calendar 1505th year, 9th month, and 10th day, with all the Gods here as witness, hereby vow: If your lordship orders for this young lady to be your sword, then she shall become your sword. If ordered to be your head, then she shall become your head. If ordered to be your legs, then she shall become your legs. This young lady’s will, this young lady’s knowledge, and this young lady’s efforts shall eternally be devoted to your lordship. Lord, I only request of you to bestow upon this young lady a small freedom.”</p><p>“I sincerely vow that I will protect thy freedom.”</p><p>I gripped Miss Farnese’s hand and stood her up.</p><p>Though this was nothing more than a formal verbal promise, this was also the first promise to be established between myself and this girl.</p><p>I could not treat it with negligence.</p><p>“Dantalian, rank 71st Demon Lord, as the sacred and inviolable representative that symbolizes absolute dignity, and as a member in an order of 72, who rules over all demons, I shall promise: Thy devotion shall be rewarded. Thy loyalty shall be honored. Thy mistakes shall be forgiven. People that hold animosity towards thee shall thus be mine enemies. The houses that had led thee into ruin, thus the House of Medici in Florence, the House of Sforza in Milan, the House of Agilolf in Pavia— and if thou so desires, then even the House of Farnese in Parma. By any means necessary, I shall avenge thee.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Did my promise come off as a surprise?</p><p>Miss Farnese blinked her eyes.</p><p>“Are you sane? They are authorities that have entire kingdoms perfectly under their control. Certainly, they are the ones that contributed in this body’s fall into slavery, but……”</p><p>“Do not worry. I shall not repeat my vow.”</p><p>I grinned.</p><p>“I shall drown the archduke of Florence in the ocean, I shall execute the duke of Milan by puncturing 36 holes into his body, I shall decapitate the count of Pavia and display his head at a crossroad, and finally, I shall leave the fate of the duchy of Farnese in your hands. 10 years. No. I shall achieve your revenge on all these people within 9 years.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“……”</p><p>“How’s that? If it’s this much then does my intent not come across clearly?”</p><p>“……By the looks of it, it seems this young lady has decided to serve under a preposterous lord.”</p><p>Laura De Farnese lightly shook her head.</p><p>“This is troubling. If you’re to present me with this many vows then it would be unfair. This young lady shall make one more promise.”</p><p>“One more?”</p><p>“Aah. If your lordship truly achieves revenge on this young lady’s behalf, then, I, Laura De Farnese, will more than gladly devote even my freedom to you. I will become your slave on my own volition, and happily be your lordship’s possession.”</p><p>“Excellent. Swearing on the River of Styx.”</p><p>“Swearing on the River of Styx.”</p><p>I lightly kissed Miss Farnese’s forehead.</p><p>The scent of dirt was strong since she was unable to wash for a long period of time , but for some reason I was fine with it.</p><p>It felt like I had gained a little sister who was a spitting image of myself.</p><p>While I was at it, I gave her a hug. Miss Farnese’s small body came into my arms. She did not resist. Rather, she leaned her head against my chest. How cute—.</p><p>“There is something this young lady is curious about, milord.”</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>“Where exactly do you plan to use this young lady? Truthfully, this young lady has no talent in politics. Albeit, this young lady considers her ability to acquire and interpret studies to be an inborn talent and can confidently boast it.”</p><p>“Ah. I plan to make you into my acting general. From now on, you shall repel foreign enemies as the supreme commander of my forces.”</p><p>“This young lady as the general?”</p><p>Miss Farnese’s voice became slightly higher.</p><p>It was probably because it was a role that she wasn’t expecting at all.</p><p>In the original history, the time that Laura De Farnese’s genius regarding military warfare bloomed was 10 years from now. It was after Count Roswell died of poisoning and she had competed for the authority over the count’s house. Until then, Laura De Farnese did not know what her true talent was.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>I was going to wake up that monster inside of her 10 years early.</p><p>“What? Was this out of your expectations?”</p><p>“Obviously. Although this young lady has read many art of war manuals, this young lady’s talent regarding military warfare is most likely non-existent. War is not something an amateur should step forward in. This young lady believes that it’s a task that must be evaluated very thoroughly before assigning to someone. Rather than that, this young lady recommends something like a curator of a library……”</p><p>I chuckled.</p><p>You were only saying that because you didn’t understand yourself fully.</p><p>In a tactical battlefield, if you were to face an enemy with the same amount of troops as yourself, your chances of winning was 100%. If your forces were smaller by 3/10, then you had an 80% chance of victory. If your forces were smaller by 1/2 then 60%. You were an extraordinary commander that grabbed hold of victory with these chances no matter what.</p><p>Even the hero had to mobilize an army 3 times the size of your own in order to defeat you. Laura De Farnese, you were the symbol of both fear and nightmare on the continent. Just by the mere news that you were participating in the battle would make countless number of cities raise their white flag in surrender.</p><p>A girl loved by the Goddess of War.</p><p>No, the Goddess of War who had become a girl.</p><p>That was the girl in front of me who was tilting her head.</p><p>“Trust my discerning eyes. You’ll shine brighter when holding the baton in a battlefield than you would reading books. I’ll make it so that history will remember your name.”</p><p>“Mm. This young lady is strangely being filled with confidence……”</p><p>Miss Farnese sent me a dubious look.</p><p>“To assign a 16-year-old lady to military affairs, it’s an unheard of allocation of personnel. Although this young lady believes that it’s beyond foolish, your lordship’s resolve is very stern. Even if this young lady ends up screwing up the military affairs, do not reproach this lady too much, okay?”</p><p>“You’re quite the cynic. I will say this again. Believe in me.”</p><p>While lightly patting Miss Farnese’s head, I took out a scroll parchment from my coat and tore it apart. Once I did, a red flame appeared and shot into the sky.</p><p>Time to escape.</p><p>Boooooom—</p><p>The flame exploded like a firework. The guards that were standing night watch must have seen it. The slave market slowly became rowdy. The security forces were moving around desperately trying to find the culprit who had shot the flare.</p><p>“……Hey! Where’d that flare……”</p><p>“……Damn it, it’s from Methoranum’s side……”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“……Cause those loaded pricks are out somewhere throwing their money……”</p><p>In the distance, we could hear people shouting and giving orders urgently.</p><p>Moments later, a group of four to five guards came rushing towards us. The torches they were holding illuminated the surroundings. The guards then noticed that Miss Farnese was outside of her cage.</p><p>“Hey! Why is a slave outside without permission?”</p><p>One soldier showed a bitter face. His eyes were full of caution. If need be, he’d probably stab me if he had to.</p><p>I put a smooth smile on my lips as I told them to calm down.</p><p>“I am a friend of that merchant from Methoranum lying over there. I was checking the quality of the slave with Sir Giacomo, but he had accidentally tore a magic scroll during the process. I apologize for starting a ruckus in the middle of the night, gentlemen.”</p><p>The soldiers glanced down at Giacomo Petrarch who was on the floor. Giacomo Petrarch was still sleeping like a log.</p><p>“What do you mean by checking the slave’s quality?”</p><p>“Well. If I were to give you a demonstration, then it’s this.”</p><p>I kissed Laura De Farnese’s nape.</p><p>And with my right hand I glided it over her body and smiled.</p><p>The guards opened their eyes wide as they gaped at us.</p><p>“In a few days, this slave will be sold to Count Roswell in the Kingdom of Brittany. The honorable Count specifically ordered for a luxurious sex slave. But gentlemen, would it not be a big deal if the slave turned out to be frigid?”</p><p>“T-That is so, but……”</p><p>“Aah. Be it a big deal or not. As you all may know, the Methoranum merchant is rather young so he’s quite ignorant in regards to this type of thing. That’s why, as his friend, I was kindly doing the check up for him.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>The soldiers exchanged glances with one another. It was apparent that they were conflicted. They wanted to arrest the culprit that had fired the flare, but at the same time, they were worried that they might be disrupting a very important task.</p><p>“Regardless, this is all work for the honorable count. I probably shouldn’t be saying this, but I’ll let you all in on a secret. Count Roswell’s name is quite high up in the kingdom for his perverted hobby. If by any possibility, the slave is unable to satisfy Count Roswell then who knows what punishment will befall us.”</p><p>It was convenient to use prestige in a situation like this. Count, count, count, by uttering this word repetitively I could scare off these guards. If you guys mess with me then a noble is going to be upset, you know? Are you okay with that? I was half threatening them like this.</p><p>“Ah, okay okay. But be careful with the flares, will you? There’s a chance that the market will get noisy.”</p><p>The soldiers took a step back. For commoners like them, a count was an authority far above their reach. Naturally they wouldn’t want to unnecessarily provoke someone like that.</p><p>Anyway, they should be arriving to pick me up soon……</p><p>The guards were hesitating.</p><p>“Sir. That, uh, for at least security reasons we have to stay here. There’s a rule that 2 soldiers must stick as supervisors whenever a slave is out of their cage.”</p><p>“Mm? You can stand guard outside the quarters.”</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>The soldiers gave a dopey laugh.</p><p>Their hostility was gone but now appeal had appeared out of nowhere. I didn’t understand why they were suddenly behaving like that. If males tried to act cute and appealed towards me, then all that’d do was make my stomach churn. They should show some consideration to my health.</p><p>The men sheathed their swords and rubbed their hands together.</p><p>“If possible, while you’re checking the quality of the flower can we watch from the side? Hehe, to tell you the truth, we often bantered with our friends about having our way with that little missy.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Wow.</p><p>My face ended up distorting by their honest comment.</p><p>The way these guards were squirming their bodies while pleading made them appear like dogs wagging their tails, which made it more unpleasant. Why were all men perverts no matter what time period?</p><p>“No, well. I too am a man so it’s not like I don’t understand how you all feel, but…… please leave obediently. I’m not an exhibitionist.”</p><p>“Goodness. Sir! Don’t be like that. Even if we’re standing as guards in a slave market, there are many things we are unable to do! Whenever a pretty lady walks around in the nude, all we can do is watch like statues while the thoughts, ‘So that’s a woman’ and ‘So that’s a hole’ goes through our heads. Is this what a person’s life is supposed to be like? Yeah?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>I was being told about a predicament that I never had any concern for……</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Truthfully, I wanted to ask why I should care……</p><p>The soldiers continued whining with a distressed expression on their faces.</p><p>“There’s no place in this area to get any release, and it’s always standing, damn it. Prostitutes don’t do business here because they’re afraid that they’d be captured and turned into slaves. And even if we wanted to go to Pavia to let out our stress, we don’t have any spare time to go. Sir. No, boss! We aren’t asking if we can partake in it, we simply want to quietly watch on the side!”</p><p>I suddenly became the boss of these men who I was meeting for the first time.</p><p>I scratched the back of my head.</p><p>At that moment, something came up in my head. Lapis Lazuli’s face. As soon as I remembered the time that Lala had prevented me from killing the old lady and the maid, my mind slightly felt uneasy.</p><p>Should I do that? I’ll show some mercy here.</p><p>“……Gentlemen. After hearing your stories I feel sorry and pity for you. Though I also feel a bit of scorn, that’s still humane so it’s fine. That’s why I’ll specially spare your lives. Okay? Let’s settle everything with this.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“—Take care of them.”</p><p>I waved my hand.</p><p>The guards tilted their heads in confusion, and at that moment.</p><p>The witches that were on stand by above us quickly descended and hit the backs of the guards’ necks. With an ‘Ack!’ all 5 men collapsed at the same time. The witches’ movements were efficient.</p><p>The witches gracefully dismounted from their brooms. 11 of the elite witches, the Berbere Sisters all knelt down at once in perfect sync.</p><p>“Oh sacred and inviolable representative that symbolizes absolute dignity, member in an order of 72, who rules over all demons. The servants of Goddess Selene has received your great lordship’s call and have presented ourselves.”</p><p>“Glad to see you all. But Humbaba, have we not known each other for the past month now? Are you not being too ceremonious?”</p><p>I spoke facetiously towards the leading witch.</p><p>“I worry that your jaw will fall off every time you give that long-winded speech of yours about sacred and inviolable whatever. From now on just refer to me as lord and omit all that civility procedures.”</p><p>“Ahaha. I understand, lord. If that’s your order.”</p><p>The head witch smiled broadly.</p><p>Her platinum blonde hair was tied into two pig tails and lightly flapped like a pair of bunny ears. I didn’t know by what principle they were moving with, but it was charming. For someone who looked like that to be a skilled soldier who also partook in a massive war 3 times, that was a bit unfair.</p><p>“Now then, everyone has been gathered here, Lord! Please give us your command. As long as your lordship pays the appropriate amount, we will even cut off our hair and weave it into silk.”</p><p>It was a saying in the demon world that meant that they will be liberal with their humble services.</p><p>I pulled Laura De Farnese closer to me.</p><p>“Turn this place into Hell.”</p><p>“Aha? By ‘Hell’, does your lordship mean?”</p><p>“I can smell a scent somewhere. It is the smell of fat emanating from disgusting masses of flesh. It is the smell of greed and hypocrisy.”</p><p>Matching the rhythm, I spoke festively.</p><p>“If they are pigs, then it would only be appropriate for them to behave like pigs and oink in a pigsty, and yet, why are they striding so boldly along the streets? What are you to do when these pigs are arrogantly trying to imitate people and shove their noses everywhere?”</p><p>“Naturally, you have to imprint onto them that they are pigs!”</p><p>The witches responded energetically.</p><p>“Only people can possess slaves. It seems those runts are arrogantly going against the moral of beasts and trying to handle slaves.”</p><p>“Please give us the order.”</p><p>The witches shouted together in one delighted voice.</p><p>“We shall make this place into a slaughterhouse tonight!”</p><p>“Yes. The command that I shall order is slaughter.”</p><p>I took a bag of coins from inside my coat and tossed it.</p><p>The head witch snatched the pouch containing 100 gold coins. She must have felt how heavy it was. A bright smile bloomed on the witch’s face.</p><p>“Slaughter those bastards without giving them the chance to even scream. This is not murder. Do not let your conscience weigh down your heart and hesitation take over your hands. As you are lords of all creation, with the authority granted to you all by the Goddesses, slaughter these livestock for our extensive cause.”</p><p>“As you command, our lord!”</p><p>In a single stroke, the witches got back onto their brooms and flew upwards.</p><p>Massive fireballs then rose up into the sky and plummeted down over the slave market. The flames exploded and pillars of fire shot upwards. Humans screamed. The massacre has begun.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The soldiers panicked and tried to retaliate, but it was in vain. The only type of troops that could go against Aerial Mage Forces were the same Aerial Mage Force. It’d be a different matter if they had many archers, but the guards in the slave market mainly consisted of foot soldiers equipped with swords. What a shame. You cannot defeat witches that are flying in the sky with mere swords. Just obediently be slaughtered like animals.</p><p>The security forces quickly fell. Gunpowder rained down from the sky and the witches spread fire magic over it. The slave market instantly turned into a sea of flame.</p><p>“R-Run away! Get out of here!”</p><p>After the organized resistance forces were eliminated, everything else became nothing more than a turkey hunt. While laughing with joy, the witches killed the guards and civilians indiscriminately. Their faces were full of leisure. This was not a battle. As I had said before, it was a slaughter.</p><p>“It’s over……”</p><p>Laura De Farnese muttered.</p><p>With interested eyes, she was chasing the movements of the witches in the sky. It seems she felt absolutely nothing for the civilians that were being slaughtered. Indeed, she was a human with a messed up head.</p><p>“I had read in an art of war manual that a single well-trained platoon of Aerial Mage Forces could win against an entire regiment of spearmen. After seeing it with this young lady’s own eyes, she understands. That it’s impossible for only infantrymen to defend against Aerial Demon Forces.”</p><p>“They’re the Berbere Sisters. One of the most elite troops in the demon world.”</p><p>“Berbere Sisters? Is that not the name of the unit that had a very active role in the Demon Lord’s forces during both the 7th and 5th Mercurian War?”</p><p>Oh, did she know of them?</p><p>Miss Farnese made an exclamation while staring up at the sky.</p><p>“To be able to see the elite troops that I’ve only seen in history books with my very own eyes…… This is quite inspiring. They are the living witnesses of history with over 250 years worth of tradition maintained inside of them. I wish to converse with them later on.”</p><p>“Uh…… If you act as my general then the Berbere Sister will soon be under your command.”</p><p>“What? Is that true!?”</p><p>Miss Farnese’s eyes shined brightly.</p><p>A very small light had returned to her dead fish eyes. Miss Farnese was clenching her small fists. It felt like a fan who was getting excited because they had just met their favorite idol.</p><p>“This is wonderful. No, this is quite wonderful! It’s an opportunity ask in person how people 250 years ago lived. All sorts of information that you can’t learn from books…… Ah, is that it!?”</p><p>Did she realize something?</p><p>Miss Farnese placed her hand on her chin and started to mutter seriously.</p><p>“……Demons usually live for hundreds of years. Just by that very fact they are no different from history books. If this young lady were to become the supreme commander, then she could use her authority to call for these demons whenever she wanted…… Is that so, is that what becomes possible. There was this kind of merit!”</p><p>It seems the Miss was able to find her own kind of charm from the position of general.</p><p>Mm. Although it sounded a bit absurd, the variety of meanings given from a job differed from person to person. I will not meddle in this matter.</p><p>“My lord! This young lady would like to know beforehand how much authority she will gain as an acting general.”</p><p>Miss Farnese had spoken in an obviously bright voice.</p><p>I chose the exact words she wanted to hear.</p><p>“I’ll be entrusting everything to you. The commandership, the judicial power within the troops, and even the authority over life and death, I shall gift this all to you.”</p><p>“T-That’s quite wonderful……slurp.”</p><p>Laura De Farnese wiped the drool from the side of her mouth.</p><p>At the moment, I could only see her as a simple pervert rather than a daughter of a duke’s family.</p><p>It seems this Miss normally maintained her cold and calm attitude, but when the topic involved something in her field of interest, she lost her mind.</p><p>Isn’t this completely a history otaku……? No, let’s call her a history enthusiast. Consider Miss Fernese’s dignity and honor.</p><p>“I shall pledge allegiance once more, my lord! Be it an acting general or anything else, leave it to this young lady. This young lady shall wipe out every last enemy that gets in your lordship’s way. As long as milord bestows upon this young lady commandership and judicial power!”</p><p>Miss Farnese grabbed onto my hand.</p><p>As soon as she did so, a message popped up.</p><p>Ο</p><p>[Laura De Farnese has been recruited as a subordinate.]</p><p>[The degree of loyalty will appear in Laura De Farnese’s status.]</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>[Unstable loyalty. The other party purely regards you as a lord contractually. The other party can betray you at any time.]</p><p>Ο</p><p>I smiled wryly.</p><p>After seeing the notice window appear at last, I became certain. That to this girl a grandiose position was of no importance. As long as it could satisfy her hobby or not. Only that could gain her interest.</p><p>That was fine.</p><p>A person with this sort of personality will not betray you unexpectedly. The contract was firm as long as the give and take principle was kept.</p><p>10 minutes since the slave market was turned into Hell.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli approached with 6 hired soldiers besides her. Despite the area around her being a sea of flame, Lala’s face was still cold. I happily welcomed her.</p><p>“Ooh, Lala. My love. How did it go?”</p><p>“We set the guard post on fire and took care of the 36 ‘prey’ that came running out of the main gate. There are no enemies that succeeded in escaping.”</p><p>“Well done. On a slim chance, we can’t have witnesses after all.”</p><p>While the witches were terrorizing the slave market from above, Lapis Lazuli took the mercenaries to assault the guard post. You could call it a small-scale feint operation. In any case, we were able to successfully clean out the slave market.</p><p>“During the suppression, three friendly forces fell in battle. Regardless of that, your highness. Please introduce the lady that is besides your highness to this one.”</p><p>“Ah, right. This is Miss Laura De Farnese that I told you about before. From now on, you shall help with domestic affairs, while Miss Farnese will help with my diplomatic affairs. I do hope that you two can cooperate together like a two-horse carriage.”</p><p>“This one understands.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli lowered her head mechanically.</p><p>“This one’s name is Lapis Lazuli. Born between a Humbaba succubus and a no named human, this one is a half-breed. As his highness Dantalian’s grand chamberlain, this one holds the position of chamberlain and high steward. This one will be in your care.”</p><p>“Mm. This young lady is Laura De Farnese. I may be a bit weird in the head whenever I see something related to history, but do take care of me as well.”</p><p>Miss Farnese approached Lapis and put out her right hand.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli slightly creased her brows.</p><p>“This one apologizes, but this one is a half-breed peasant.”</p><p>An outcast was not allowed to come in contact with others.</p><p>It was an unwritten rule that was used by both humans and demons.</p><p>Despite that, Miss Farnese tilted her head side to side.</p><p>“Mm? Aah, it’s fine. It doesn’t matter. This young lady is also a love-child of a slave. I’m the daughter that was born when my father, the duke, raped my mother who was a slave. If you were to quibble about this young lady’s social status then it is not a bloodline that you can go anywhere bragging about, so please do not refuse.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Everyone became silent by the sudden bombshell.</p><p>She was a child born by a slave being raped? Were you telling me that she wasn’t an illegitimate child gained from a normal servant? As we looked at her with an astonished gaze, Miss Farnese uttered an ‘Ah’ and spoke.</p><p>“Oh right. What this young lady had just said is a secret. This young lady is known as the daughter of a servant publicly in order to maintain the House’s reputation. This young lady’s birth mother was poisoned the very day she was born. From then on a nanny took care of this young lady. That person is the one publicly known as this lady’s mother.”</p><p>“That’s information that wasn’t written on the report……”</p><p>I spoke bitterly.</p><p>Even in&nbsp;that kind of secret wasn’t revealed.</p><p>While we were abhorring the thought of how shady and dark aristocracy was, Miss Farnese took both of Lala’s hands and shook them energetically.</p><p>“Since this young lady is the junior, please guide this young lady through many things. Is it fine to call you big sister Lazuli from now on?”</p><p>“…… It is fine to refer to this one by anything.”</p><p>“Mm. Then I shall call you big sister. Big sister Lazuli.”</p><p>Ooh.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli lowered her brows as if she was perplexed.</p><p>It was my first time seeing Lala be troubled by someone other than myself. It was somewhat amusing.</p><p>Hm? Lapis Lazuli gave a sideways glance towards my direction. She did not say anything out loud, but rather, moved her lips so that only I could understand.</p><p>‘It seems your highness recruited a girl that’s just like your highness.’</p><p>‘No. I won’t deny it, but I’m not as unruly as she is. I’m much more docile.’</p><p>If you got onto the level of Lala and I, then communication by only lip movements was possible.</p><p>‘Is it this one that’s misunderstanding the meaning of the word docile? Or does your highness have an arrow going through your highness’ head?’</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>What.</p><p>‘This one is at her limit taking care of your highness alone. But for there to exist in the world another person who is similar to your highness? There’s a limit to nightmares. From now on, please take care of Miss Farnese yourself, your highness.’</p><p>‘……’</p><p>That was strange. It felt like the way she was treating me was slowly getting worse……</p><p>Did I really deserve to receive this sort of abuse from my vassal merely because I’d spend my time sleeping for 12 hours, sharing intimacy for 4 hours, and working for 8 hours everyday? No matter how you saw it, this was a diligent schedule. Lapis Lazuli was being too fastidious. This forever-on-her-period succubus.</p><p>Well, the plan itself ended without a hitch. We should start making our way back now. I succeeded in taking Laura De Farnese under my wing and got rid of all the witnesses. It was a happy ending.</p><p>“Your highness. Please wait a second.”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>It was right before I got on the backseat of a witch’s broom.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli had called for me and was pointing towards a certain direction. Wondering what the problem was, I looked towards the area she was pointing at and saw Giacomo Petrarch and the delightful bunch of guards sleeping there.</p><p>“There are still survivors. Please take care of them.”</p><p>“Aah. Those humans are fine. I left them alive on purpose.”</p><p>“On…… purpose?”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli tilted her head with a face that appeared as if she didn’t understand.</p><p>“This one apologizes, but this one is unable to grasp what your highness’ intentions are. Is there any other benefit your highness gains for leaving survivors?”</p><p>“There are no benefits. I’m merely leaving them alive because I want to.”</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>“That sleeping young man over there is Giacomo Petrarch. He’s a rather pure fellow that was dropped into this savage era. Those kinds of humans must live. They leave hope in this world like a blank sheet of paper.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>At that moment, something strange happened.</p><p>Contrary to coming to an understanding like I expected her to come to, the doubt on Lapis Lazuli’s face had grown further.</p><p>“…… Then what about the other humans?”</p><p>“It was too pathetic to keep watching those fools, so I bestowed upon them mercy. They’re quite the lucky fellows. If they had behaved more unpleasantly then their heads would have flown off.”</p><p>I smirked.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli stared at me.</p><p>In her eyes that were as dark as the ocean depths, not even a single ounce of emotion could be seen.</p><p>Shortly after, Lala nodded.</p><p>“……Is that so. This one understands. Miss Humbaba, please take Miss Farnese and the hired soldiers to the back entrance of the slave market and wait there.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Because Lapis Lazuli had suddenly given an order to the witches, the head witch asked back.</p><p>“Go to the back entrance first?”</p><p>“Yes. There is something that his highness and this one must discuss in private. Since other people cannot be allowed to overhear, please take responsibility and lead everyone away, Miss Humbaba.”</p><p>“Eeh. But our duty to escort his lordship……”</p><p>“Do not worry. It will not take long.”</p><p>The head witch turned to look at me. Her eyes appeared as if they were asking me ‘Should we do as the succubus had ordered?’. I didn’t know exactly what was going on, but I took Lala’s side for now.</p><p>“Carry out the grand chamberlain’s order.”</p><p>Establishing a vassal’s authority in front of the other subordinates was important. There was nobody who would follow a king that disrespected his vassals.</p><p>The witches took to the night sky and flew off.</p><p>The only ones remaining in the ruins of the slave market was now just Lazuli and myself.</p><p>I tilted my head.</p><p>“What’s the problem all of a sudden? You didn’t even consult with me beforehand.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli didn’t respond.</p><p>It could have been my imagination, but her complexion looked like it had become colder.</p><p>As her silence grew longer, the anxiety in my chest spread as well. It almost felt as if a caterpillar was slowly crawling over the surface of my heart.</p><p>I called out to her in a low voice.</p><p>“Lala?”</p><p>Silence again.</p><p>Instead of giving a response, Lapis Lazuli started to walk. It wasn’t a fast pace. With slow, but very distinctive steps, she approached Giacomo Petrarch and the guards.</p><p>Shiiiing</p><p>Lapis Lazuli unsheathed one of the guards’ swords.</p><p>“Wait, Lala. What are you……”</p><p>Ο</p><p>Without giving me the chance to stop her.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli swung the sword and stabbed into a guard’s neck.</p><p>Ο</p><p>“What……?”</p><p>The blade dug sharply into human flesh.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli did not stop there. After twisting the blade free, she immediately stabbed another guard. From a passed out state, the guards fell into an eternal slumber in an instant. By the time I could barely make out the situation that was happening before me, Lapis Lazuli had committed her third murder.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“What are you doing, Lazuli!?”</p><p>“Doing what must be done.”</p><p>“What must be done……?”</p><p>Even for myself, who usually never fell into panic, I couldn’t recover my senses as quickly in this situation.</p><p>“What does that mean? Explain it so I can understand!”</p><p>Despite having obviously heard my shout, Lapis Lazuli did not stop her sword. The sharp edge of the blade slit the throat of the fourth guard. Blood sprayed out like a fountain and covered Lala’s white skin with dirty blood.</p><p>“You…… Stop right this instant!”</p><p>“This one apologizes, but this one cannot follow that order.”</p><p>“Lapis Lazuli, I am warning you. If you move even a single hair, if you ignore my order once more, I swear on Zeus! I will personally tear off your flesh!”</p><p>Schunk</p><p>After killing off the final guard.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli silently turned to look at me.</p><p>The blood stench silence weighed down heavily around us.</p><p>Unsure of what to say, my lips shook. I couldn’t understand the other person’s behaviour at all.</p><p>……The plan had finished without a hitch. We had obtained a satisfying success. After covering up the incident here in the slave market as something another organization had done, we were going to leave casually. Subsequently to traversing across the continent and returning back to my Demon Lord castle, that was when the true preparation for battle was going to begin. And everything following after that was going to go by beautifully.</p><p>But why.</p><p>“……Why are you going against my orders? The operation is over. Everything is going smoothly just as planned. What are you discontent with? Why are you exercising this pointless slaughter?”</p><p>My voice shook because of the sense of betrayal.</p><p>The reason why I had spared these guards, who I originally planned to kill, was solely because I was being considerate of Lapis Lazuli. She disliked pointless killing. That’s why I had gone against my own preference to barely bring out mercy.</p><p>And yet, why?</p><p>Lapis Lazuli opened her mouth.</p><p>“Your highness. Please stop messing around.”</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>“Pointless slaughter? Please explain to this one if any of these deaths are pointless.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli gestured around herself.</p><p>Everything was set ablaze. The only things that remained standing were the iron frames of cages. Below those were corpses and piles of flesh burning in the inferno.</p><p>“Your highness had ordered for us to slaughter the guards, the civilians, and even the slaves without discrimination. The reason is clear. In order to not leave evidence of your highness’ visit here.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli gazed at me.</p><p>“Solely for that reason, 150 humans and 50 demons died tonight. But to come this far and now want to spare 6 people? This one is unable to understand no matter how hard this one tries. So please, your highness, explain to this foolish one.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Is there any pointless death here?”</p><p>A quiet question.</p><p>And at the same time, an endlessly cold comment.</p><p>“The lord Dantalian that this one had sworn loyalty to is a cold-hearted and ruthless individual. If by a rare chance he were to be threatened, his highness is thorough enough to not treat even the smallest of threats lightly. Where did that person go? Where did this one’s lord disappear to?”</p><p>“No. That’s not it. I was……”</p><p>“Has your highness lost your vision? After the outbreak of the Black Death, did becoming one of the richest Demon Lords on the continent put your highness’ mind at ease? Your highness. Mercy and generosity is a privilege for only the strong. The weak does not have the right to show mercy. Has your highness Dantalian already become powerful?”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli spoke flatly in all respect.</p><p>With emotionless eyes.</p><p>She stared straight at me.</p><p>For some reason, that gaze froze my heart.</p><p>“Lala……”</p><p>“This one shall list all of the strong people that she knows of. Rank 1st, Demon Lord Baal is powerful enough to start a massive war on his own. Rank 2nd, Demon Lord Agares is strong enough to annihilate an entire army by himself. Rank 5th Demon Lord Marbas controls the political world, rank 8th Demon Lord Barbatos has immortal warriors loyal to her, and rank 9th Demon Lord Paimon has all the support from every citizen in the demon world. This one shall ask. What does your highness Dantalian have?”</p><p>I have gold.</p><p>I have nothing but gold.</p><p>“Your highness had promised this one that she’ll be able to enjoy to the fullest the greatest of authority. That is fine. This one will tell your highness clearly. The level of authority that your highness currently has is still at the very bottom. Lord Dantalian. Is your highness already pleased that your highness has become a person of power?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I couldn’t answer.</p><p>“……”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli turned her back and lifted the sword once more.</p><p>After killing all five of the guards, the only person remaining was Giacomo Petrarch.</p><p>The young man with a foolishly pure soul.</p><p>I forced my mouth to move.</p><p>“……Lazuli. That’s not what I intended. I simply thought it’d be okay to show generosity every once in awhile. Is that not what you wanted from me?”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli stopped.</p><p>She turned her head to gaze at me.</p><p>Hoping to resolve the misunderstanding, I spoke.</p><p>“It’s true. Did you not stop me when I tried to kill your mother and punish that maid? That’s why I judged that you wouldn’t dislike this.”</p><p>“That is incorrect.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli shook her head.</p><p>“That is perfectly incorrect, Lord Dantalian. It seems your highness still does not know what kind of person this one is. This one is disappointed.”</p><p>“Lala……?”</p><p>“If your highness thinks that this one is similar to that of a middle-class maiden, then your highness is heavily mistaken. This one shall show your highness clearly what kind of person this one is.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli raised the sword high into the air.</p><p>And then.</p><p>Ο</p><p>[Lapis Lazuli’s affection went down by 1.]</p><p>Ο</p><p>She swung down the blade.</p><p>The sword landed on the exact center of Giacomo Petrarch’s neck. Again, Lapis Lazuli swung the blade. Once. Twice. The blade slashed down without end. Even though the person had already died instantly, Lapis Lazuli did not stop. Blood spurted out and drenched her body with blood.</p><p>“…… Stop.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>[Lapis Lazuli’s affection went down by 1.]</p><p>Ο</p><p>“Stop it, Lazuli.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>[Lapis Lazuli’s affection went down by 1.]</p><p>Ο</p><p>“Is blood not getting on your face? You can stop now……”</p><p>Ο</p><p>[Lapis Lazuli’s affection went down by 1.]</p><p>Ο</p><p>Like a dog chasing its shadow.</p><p>She continued hacking away at the corpse.</p><p>Each time she did, it felt like a part of my mind was torn out.</p><p>Ο</p><p>♦</p><p>Ο</p><p>I wonder how much time had passed.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli had ceased.</p><p>The sound effect that kept ringing like crazy a moment ago could no longer be heard.</p><p>Name: Lapis Lazuli</p><p>Stamina: E rank Power: D rank Defense: F rank</p><p>Affection: 0</p><p>It was because Lapis Lazuli’s affection had hit 0.</p><p>Because it had reached the point where it could drop no further, it had become quiet.</p><p>She bent down and picked something up.</p><p>It was Giacomo Petrarch’s head.</p><p>“Please look, your highness.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli spoke.</p><p>“Remember the expression on this man’s face. Remember the white of his eyes and his stupidly opened mouth. Look at his unsightly demise after dying by this one’s hands so easily. If your highness ever forgets that your highness is still weak, then your highness will be forced to remember by someone else.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Who that someone is could end up being Paimon or Barbatos. In that moment, the face that your highness will make will be no different to this man’s face.”</p><p>The flame burning brightly to the side reflected off of Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>The light illuminated her body and dropped a pitch black shadow on the other side of her.</p><p>She was the center point. With her in the middle, the light and shadow was split in half.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli stood upright in the exact center. Doing so, she was demanding for me to do the same.</p><p>“Please etch this moment into your highness’ brain.”</p><p>Withstanding a long moment of silence.</p><p>I was barely able to spit out my words.</p><p>“Lazuli.”</p><p>“Yes, your highness. Please speak.”</p><p>“You are a devilish woman.”</p><p>As if it was obvious.</p><p>Lapis Lazuli nodded.</p><p>A dark crimson drop of blood slid down her slender jaw and dripped.</p><p>“Until now, what did your highness consider this one to be?”</p><p>%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-2-page-157</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day 20 Niflheim, Governor’s Palace Wax dripped down a candle.</p><p>It was night. The sky outside the window was already dark.</p><p>I spoke while gazing at the softly burning candle.</p><p>“I wonder what I had done wrong.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“While traveling through the air from Pavia to the Empire of Habsburg, and all the way to my castle in the Black Mountain, Lapis and I did not share a single word. My head was in turmoil.”</p><p>I raised my head.</p><p>Barbatos was seated on the sofa to the other side of myself.</p><p>Her brows were knitted in the shape of 八, and her lips were retracted as if she was going to say something, except, Barbatos was unable to utter a single word. At some point while listening to my story, she had forgotten about drinking alcohol and was only staring at my face.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>At a loss for words.</p><p>Literally.</p><p>“I had definitely resolved myself. That if Lapis stepped out of line one more time, then I would show her her place. But once it actually happened…… be it rage or whatever, every emotion disappeared and left behind only confusion.”</p><p>What exactly was Lapis hoping for.</p><p>“It was because I couldn’t understand. Lapis stopped me when I had tried to kill the old lady. She had stopped me again when I tried to kill that maid. Is it not weird? Isn’t it? Barbatos, this is abnormal.”</p><p>I raised the corners of my mouth.</p><p>I intended to smile but my mouth ended up twitching instead.</p><p>To Barbatos, my current state must appear incredibly unseemly.</p><p>As it was proof that my emotion was escaping my control, I left it alone.</p><p>……Right now, it was much better off like this.</p><p>“If she wished for me to be a ruthless villain. If Lapis’ request was for me to become a ruthless villain……Then she would have left me alone. When I tried to kill that old hag and when I was about to kill that maid. It would have been right to have left me to do what I wanted in those moments. That way her actions would have made sense, right?”</p><p>“……That’s right.”</p><p>“Why did she request for me to show mercy at some times, and then request for me to be violent at others? What did she want from me? I started to become depressed whenever I thought about this……”</p><p>I covered my eyes with my hand.</p><p>“Barbatos. Believe me. I intended to consider whatever Lapis requested of me. If Lapis asked of me to become a merciful and generous lord, then I would have seriously complied. If she asked of me to become a cruel tyrant, then I would have gladly accepted that as well. I was prepared. I was prepared to walk down that path with her. It’s true.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“However, I can’t be both. That’s impossible. Walking down 2 different paths at the same time is simply not possible. Then what other option remained? Hm? Move according to Lapis’ whim, was that the only option left?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“That’s impossible as well. That’s the most absurd action I could possibly take. Even I have a last line. To spare people when Lapis tells me to, to kill people when Lapis tells me to…… I cannot become a puppet like that for her. Never.”</p><p>That meant death for me.</p><p>With no doubt, the relationship between Lala and myself was collapsing.</p><p>Even after returning to my castle, we did not share a single conversation. Our shared bedroom life naturally disappeared as well.</p><p>In preparation for the army of 2,000 that was going to invade, we did make plans and arrangements, but that was it.</p><p>Words exchanged were kept at a minimum.</p><p>Technical and business-like conversations.</p><p>Excluding those, no other words were shared between us.</p><p>Time went by helplessly.</p><p>Barbatos spoke.</p><p>“……Let’s rest a bit, Dantalian.”</p><p>The sneer and contempt that she showed initially was nowhere to be seen now.</p><p>There was a faint sorrow and clear hesitation left on her face.</p><p>The reason her sorrow was faint was because she was doing her best to not show sympathy for me, and the reason her hesitation was clear was because she was holding herself back from giving any rash advice. Just from that expression alone, I could tell that Barbatos was a good woman.</p><p>“Rest?”</p><p>“You idiot. It’s already night. You’ve been talking for several hours now. Your voice is cracked and your face looks as rotten as a corpse.”</p><p>I blankly took out a hand mirror and looked down at it.</p><p>As Barbatos had said, my face was drained like a zombie.</p><p>It seems I had excessively gotten immersed into my role.</p><p>“Right…… I guess we should rest a bit.”</p><p>“Don’t you have anything to drink?”</p><p>Barbatos shook the glass which was in her right hand. Her cup was empty. She grinned like an ill-natured child.</p><p>“Now that I think about it, isn’t this a funny fellow? Oi, Dantalian. I’ve been listening courteously to your love affairs for a while now, but you can’t even serve me proper alcohol? For a bastard who made a shit ton of money from selling black herbs, what’s with that? If you keep that up, you’re going to put people off.”</p><p>“Haha.”</p><p>She was probably nagging light-heartedly to shift the mood.</p><p>I could feel the small consideration coming from the other party.</p><p>Indeed, Barbatos is a good woman.</p><p>In this tedious life, consideration was like salt. No matter how awfully bland life was, if you added a little salt then it at least became somewhat appetizing. Barbatos knew how to utilize that properly.</p><p>“Of course, I knew you would come out like that.”</p><p>“Hmm. And what do you mean by that?”</p><p>“Wait a moment. I’ll bring something that you’ll surely like.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I approached a corner of the reception room and took a bottle out of a cabinet. It was a wine bottle. After displaying the bottle to Barbatos with a ‘tadah’, her face froze immediately.</p><p>“D-Don’t tell me. That isn’t what I think it is, is it?”</p><p>Unlike her usual self, Barbatos’ words shook.</p><p>I grinned.</p><p>“The most famous region in the demon world to brew luxurious wine, Fire Spring Hell. Among the areas within that region, the highest quality bottle that’s only created once a year in the Count of Lava’s territory. Wine among wines. Made on the 1101st year of Balleleunium, it is wine that was brewed in commemoration of the 2nd Viet war. It’s the genuine product that has aged 400 years.”</p><p>“That’s ridiculous!”</p><p>Barbatos shouted.</p><p>“That’s high quality wine that even old man Baal has trouble getting his hands on!”</p><p>“I put in some effort.”</p><p>To be exact, I used Ivar Lodbrok’s effort.</p><p>This was a clear example that showed that having a pushover with many personal connections made life convenient.</p><p>“Goddesses, that’s insane! That’s genuine? That isn’t genuine, right!?”</p><p>Barbatos was already off the sofa at this point.</p><p>Demon Lord Barbatos’ love for wine was well-known.</p><p>She considered herself to be the greatest drinker, and the other Demon Lords recognized her as the strongest heavy drinker among them. To her, this wine was like a Holy Grail. Stripping off manners and dignity, she ran towards me.</p><p>“Give that to me!”</p><p>“Of course. Here.”</p><p>I tossed the bottle high into the air.</p><p>Lightly, as if I was playing with a ball.</p><p>“Kyaaaaaaaak!?”</p><p>“Do well to catch it nicely on your own.”</p><p>“This crazy fucker—!?”</p><p>Barbatos instantly utilized magic to grab the bottle which was high in the air. From what I could comprehend, 3 layers of black magic activated at the same time.</p><p>First, Barbatos had stepped down onto the room floor and leaped more than 3 meters into the air. A black mist appeared in the empty space near the bottle and wrapped itself around it. Thanks to that, the descent of the bottle slowed down. Following after, an invisible hand grabbed hold of the wine.</p><p>If other mages were to witness this scene, then they most likely wouldn’t have been able to hold back their bewilderment. First reason, the fact that 3 layers of magic were activated at the same time. Second reason, the fact that 3 layers of magic succeeded in activating without any chant or incantation whatsoever. And final reason, the fact that this great technique in magic was used merely to grab a single bottle of wine.</p><p>Sure, it was obvious that Barbatos didn’t care about what other mages thought of her. Her everything was focused onto that ‘1101st year of Balleleunium’. The magic ability which she had trained and trained throughout the 500 years of her life, in this moment, was used for a glass bottle with a mere 10cm diameter. I wonder if even the Goddesses would be moved by her concentration.</p><p>Finally, the bottle came into her hands and she landed safely on the floor.</p><p>“Uaaaaaaaah!”</p><p>Barbatos raised the bottle of wine into the air with both arms. Like a basketball player who had succeeded in getting a rebound shot in during a decisive moment.</p><p>In this moment, she was without a doubt, the ground ruler.</p><p>“Did you see that, fuck! This is the greatness of the fucking rank 8th Barbatos—!”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>I unconsciously sent her an applause.</p><p>“I’m not really sure, but it seems some amazing acrobatics happened.”</p><p>“Dantalian you son of a bitch!”</p><p>Barbatos glared at me fiercely.</p><p>“Swines like you don’t have the right to even have a drop of this delicacy! How dare you throw this Balleleunium like some child’s toy! Aaaang!?”</p><p>It was amazing. For a person who barely looked 13 years old, a terrifying aura was coming off from her glare. If it weren’t for the wine bottle being held desperately in her arms like a treasure, I may have really been scared. Yeah, really.</p><p>“For crying out loud! I really can’t believe it. Wine that’s aged 400 years! The brewer, using the most special magic in the world, a magic spell developed specifically for the purpose of preserving wine, would recast the spell every half month. This wine that was preserved through several generations just to barely become the finished product that it is now! For you to throw this wine that isn’t even released in the markets, and only gifted to individuals that the archduke of Fire Spring personally judges to be the most noble and beautiful! To throw it like some son of a bitch! You bastard aren’t even worth the same as the dirt on a crow’s talon!”</p><p>I nodded my head.</p><p>“I became more certain of how severe of a drunkard you are.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“I’m not a drunkard. I simply love to drink, you half-wit moron!”</p><p>While grinding her teeth, Barbatos looked down at the glass bottle. A black magical energy flowed out from her hands. She must have been checking if the wine was genuine or not through magic.</p><p>“!?”</p><p>Barbatos let out a gasp.</p><p>Her expression became as slim as the face in Edvard Munch’s&nbsp;.</p><p>“Y-You…… If this isn’t the real thing, then really, I won’t leave you alone for the crime of deceiving……”</p><p>“I’ll let you have the first sip.”</p><p>“—!”</p><p>Barbatos hiccupped.</p><p>“But the very first sip…… t-tastes the best, you know?”</p><p>“That’s why I’m letting you have it.”</p><p>I gave her a big smile.</p><p>To her right now, I was an angel.</p><p>I probably appeared as radiant as a saint who had received word from the Gods.</p><p>“Are we not friends, Barbatos?”</p><p>“Dantalian……”</p><p>Barbatos gazed this way with touched eyes.</p><p>“You might be a son of a bitch, but you’re a really good son of a bitch.”</p><p>“……Although I’m considerably distressed on whether to take that as a compliment or not, but for the sake of politeness, I’ll receive it as a compliment.”</p><p>“T-This is not the time for that. Wine glass. Where did I leave my wine glass!?”</p><p>Barbatos swung her arm around frantically. Once she did, the glass cup that was rolling around on the carpet floor floated right into her hand. Barbatos gulped.</p><p>“G-Good, Balleleunium 1101. Show me the scent of your sensual skin.”</p><p>“Though I think the thing that’s sensual isn’t the wine, but the inside of your head……”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>Barbatos started chanting a spell. I can guarantee that out of all the magic spells I’ve witnessed up until now, this was the most inspiring out of them all. The reason behind this was because this was really an absolutely useless spell. This magic, as a cork-remover-spell, was being chanted by Barbatos purely for the sake of removing the cork. As she muttered the incantation of the spell, the cork slowly inched upwards, until finally, with a ‘pop’ the cork shot out.</p><p>Barbatos brought the opening of the bottle to the end of her nose and inhaled.</p><p>“……”</p><p>Ah. That was the face of someone who had lost their mind.</p><p>It was like her consciousness had soared off 500 meters into the sky.</p><p>Despite not having even tasted the alcohol, Barbatos’ face was already enveloped in bliss.</p><p>“S-So Heaven does exist.”</p><p>“As the very person who had gifted that to you, I’m quite happy that you’re so pleased by the smell alone. Go ahead and drink it now.”</p><p>“Drink? This……?”</p><p>Barbatos started to tremble with the wine bottle and glass cup in her hands.</p><p>“Dantalian, you don’t know the value of this item. How could you drink a treasure? You don’t drink treasures. You aren’t supposed to……”</p><p>“I thought you said you liked alcohol. The greatest alcohol is right there. Are you still not going to drink it?”</p><p>“Keuuk……!”</p><p>Barbatos distorted her face in despair.</p><p>“What contradiction is this? Because I love alcohol more than anyone else, I desire for the Balleleunium. But because I love alcohol more than anyone else, even more so, I cannot drink the Balleleunium! A paradox! An agony! Is this what life was……!?”</p><p>A little further and she’d discover the truth of the universe.</p><p>Her highness Barbatos’ charisma was crumbling because of a single bottle of wine.</p><p>“Give it here. I’ll just pour it myself.”</p><p>“O-Okay.”</p><p>Barbatos obediently passed the glass bottle to me.</p><p>Following drinking etiquette, I courteously poured the wine with one arm. With a very nervous complexion, Barbatos watched the glass cup be filled with the scarlet liquid. I seriously thought she’d have me executed if I spilled a single drop.</p><p>“Cheers.”</p><p>“Ch……Cheers.”</p><p>Clink</p><p>A clear sound resonated as our glass cups collided. As I enjoyed the wine in a relaxed manner, Barbatos stared at me restlessly.</p><p>“I-Is it good?”</p><p>“Well, of course it’s good.”</p><p>“How does it taste, hm? Describe it with as much detail as you can.”</p><p>“…… I don’t know why you’re asking me to do that when you can just drink it yourself.”</p><p>“Cause it’d be a waste……”</p><p>I retract my previous statement.</p><p>Barbatos was a hopeless woman.</p><p>“Hoo haa. Hoo haa.”</p><p>Barbatos started breathing deeply. She even began muttering to herself that ‘this is nothing more than red wine’. I wonder if her muttering had an effect because her complexion became more relaxed. If I were to say something in my own personal point of view, I honestly thought she was crazy.</p><p>At last, Barbatos placed her glass on her lips and took a sip of the wine. Her eyes stayed closed for a long period of time. Then, her shoulders started to tremble and she suddenly burst into tears.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Uwaah…… I did well to stay alive. It was hard times. It was difficult to live these 500 years, but, uwaah, I really did well to live this long.”</p><p>“……Sure.”</p><p>Even I couldn’t help but be stunned by this situation.</p><p>Barbatos was sipping the wine while shedding warm tears. The surprising thing was, that while she was drinking, the process of taking in the fragrance of the wine through her nose, the process of rolling the wine on her tongue, etc, she devotedly made sure to completely perform all the tasting procedures. Although she was insane, she was rationally insane.</p><p>“Give it here.”</p><p>Barbatos instantly emptied her glass and forcefully took the bottle from me. Without being able to resist, I passed the bottle to her.</p><p>“Heueuk. Heuk, gulp.”</p><p>While crying.</p><p>“Uwaaah.”</p><p>Pour another glass.</p><p>“It’s good. It’s so good, fuck.”</p><p>And cry again.</p><p>Quite the sincere scene was happening before me.</p><p>The image of a girl with the outer-appearance of a 12-year-old was bawling as she poured and drank alcohol. If you put it in good terms, it was surreal. If you put it in bad terms, she was considerably like a nut-case.</p><p>I spoke.</p><p>“Why are you making it unappetizing for others by cursing and drinking? I thought you said it was good.”</p><p>“Heueuk. As much as it’s delectable, each time you drink it, the same amount you drink is also disappearing from the total amount. That’s really, truly a fuck. Furthermore, people say that you can’t discuss this feeling with someone who had Balleleunium without shedding tears.”</p><p>It was a saying that made you seriously suspicious of the origin……</p><p>Anyway, we succeeded in properly shifting the mood between us.</p><p>Originally, because of a Demon Lord’s constitution, it was possible to drink as much alcohol as possible and not get drunk. It was thanks to the mana circulating in our bodies that automatically cleaned out the intoxication. However, according to Barbatos, when ‘receiving’ Balleleunium, it was considered a great discourtesy to not get drunk by it. Barbatos had purposely stopped the mana circulation in her body and allowed herself to become intoxicated.</p><p>Alcoholics are quite terrifying.</p><p>“And so? What happened next?”</p><p>Barbatos spoke with a slight redness on her face. It seems she was tipsy at just the appropriate amount.</p><p>“After listening to your story, that wasn’t the point when you broke up, right? Then that means there’s another decisive moment. Coolly let everything out, kid. Since I was able to savor the taste of Balleleunium, I’ll take responsibility of you till the very end.”</p><p>“That’s quite thankful.”</p><p>I smiled bitterly.</p><p>“Shall we cheers first?”</p><p>“Ooh, Yeah. Cheers!”</p><p>As the toasts continued, it grew deeper in the night. Through the window of the reception room, an owl hooted. I was able to move my lips with more ease than before, and Barbatos chimed in with further enthusiasm.</p><p>“First, the army invaded my castle.”</p><p>“Hou, so the message was the real deal.”</p><p>“Aah. Although the number was a bit lacking compared to what was written……”</p><p>With a ‘ding’.</p><p>The grandfather clock on the first floor of the governor’s palace rang dully.</p><p>Notifying everyone that it was midnight.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-2-page-174</p><p>Name: Laura De Farnese Race: Human Job: Slave(A+) Reputation: Foremost Examinee</p><p>Leadership: S rank Ο Might: D rank Ο Intelligence: A rank Politics: F rank Ο Charm: S+ rank Ο Technique: A rank</p><p>Title: 1.

So it is according to the information from our&nbsp;spies. It seems there’s nothing impressive about this Demon Lord named Dantalian……”</p><p>I nodded after hearing the report from my subordinate.</p><p>Currently, my troops, the troops of the Margrave of Rosenburg were marching slowly. The destination was Demon Lord Dantalian’s stronghold. Our advance was proceeding&nbsp;smoothly. The morale among the troops was high, and everyone’s steps were light.</p><p>It was an abrupt dispatch, but they were all compliant. I was honestly grateful. A force of 1,500 soldiers were all obediently following orders from their superior without voicing any complaints. There was nothing as fulfilling as this for a person of great stature.</p><p>“Your lordship. Do you think it’s true? The rumor that there’s an endless supply of black herbs piled up in Demon Lord Dantalian’s castle……?”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s true or not. The important thing&nbsp;is the fact that that&nbsp;kind of rumor has widely spread throughout our land.”</p><p>The decisive reason for our dispatch was because of the Black Death.</p><p>This terrifying plague had instantly established itself as a nightmare, reigning over all the people of the land. The friends and family that were fine yesterday would end up as cold corpses after a single night. It was terror itself.</p><p>Unfortunately, the people of my land were no different. Within a single month of the outbreak, 2,000 of my citizens had died.</p><p>Everyone trembled in fear of the plague, regardless of one’s social status. According to a report from a tax collector, the population of a small mountain village had all perished. He had initially gone there to collect taxes, but ended up burying corpses instead. It was a disturbing story……</p><p>“Insecurity and fear are at its peak for my subjects. If we were to stay still and take no action, then the public sentiment will be disturbed. If that were to happen, then there is the possibility that a revolt may occur as a result.”</p><p>“A revolt……”</p><p>My&nbsp;adjutant’s face stiffened.</p><p>He must have been surprised that I, the lord, would&nbsp;mention the possibility of a rebellion. My adjutant may have been competent, but his courage was a bit lacking. Would he relax if I smiled here?</p><p>“As far as things go, this is merely a hypothesis. Think about it yourself, what would my subjects do if their lord did nothing while their close friends and colleagues were dying? It would be difficult for my subjects&nbsp;to tolerate that.”</p><p>“But that’s irrational…… Is the Black Death not divine punishment from the gods? That’s not something within your lordship’s capability to handle.”</p><p>“Be it divine punishment or anything else, it is the lord’s duty to look after his subjects. If a lord were to run away from this situation, the only thing that awaits him or her&nbsp;is ruin.”</p><p>“Your lordship.”</p><p>My&nbsp;adjutant looked at me with a gaze full of admiration.</p><p>Stop looking at me with those kind of eyes.&nbsp;Have I not said something obvious?This is quite troubling that youngsters these days are&nbsp;so easily moved by anything.</p><p>Or is it perhaps that I’ve gotten so old that I’m unable to keep up with their sensibility? This is depressing. The only things which&nbsp;increase through age are&nbsp;wrinkles and thigh fat. It would be nice to quickly go into a battlefield and die an honorable death……</p><p>If I were to voice a complaint, then it would be&nbsp;the fact that there has been no war that felt like an actual war in these past few years. Something like a massive war was even more improbable due to the outbreak of the Black Death.</p><p>Thus, I had a substantial chance of dying, not&nbsp;on the rough grounds of a battlefield, but on top of a comfortable bed instead. In other words, a shameful death for a warrior. I wouldn’t have the honor to face my ancestors in the afterlife……</p><p>“At the very least, the citizens must&nbsp;know that the higher-ups are not fooling&nbsp;around. Whether there are black herbs in the demon lord castle or not, that is a secondary issue. Showing them that we’re exerting our utmost effort in order to do something is what’s important.”</p><p>“I understand. That’s what politics are, huh……”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“The thing that we should be thankful&nbsp;for is that the main character of the rumor is Dantalian. It’s a relief that it’s&nbsp;the rank 71st Demon Lord.”</p><p>“A relief?”</p><p>That was so.</p><p>Suppose the rumor to have spread was that the one holding a monopoly over the black herb was the rank 8th Barbatos. It would be immensely difficult for my&nbsp;Margrave forces&nbsp;alone to assault Barbatos. Making use of the&nbsp;rumor politically would be impossible.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>On the other hand, rank 71st Dantalian was a rookie.</p><p>He was on the level of an individual&nbsp;that you’d often forget about.</p><p>“We can bend Dantalian’s neck whenever we so desire. Honestly, it’s a waste to even call him a Demon Lord. He is simply a ricefish.&nbsp;Nothing more, and nothing less.”</p><p>According to the information we’ve gathered, Dantalian doesn’t have a proper base and resides in a cave. He doesn’t even have a single outpost as a rampart.It would be fine to declare; subjugating Demon Lord Dantalian was as easy as breaking a child’s wrist.</p><p>Thus, it was fortunate.</p><p>“We’re able to dispatch our troops because our target is Dantalian. If it was Barbatos, then we wouldn’t have been able to move an inch. We would have had to sit and wait patiently until my subjects start to&nbsp;riot. It is fortunate that the source of the rumor is Dantalian……”</p><p>My adjutant marveled.</p><p>“After listening to your lordship’s words, I understand that the Goddess of Fortune is indeed looking over your lordship.”</p><p>“Mm? Is that so?”</p><p>“Yes. Aren’t the other domains&nbsp;so&nbsp;far away&nbsp;that it would be difficult&nbsp;to dispatch our troops even if we wanted to? But your lordship’s territory is comparatively closer to Dantalian’s Demon Lord castle. No matter how big the empire is, only your lordship was given this opportunity!”</p><p>“That is luck. You can only rely on this sort of luck a few times in your entire life.”</p><p>But I see. My adjutant has a point. Should I allow myself to be delighted that the Goddess presented me with this chance?</p><p>Bringing out my voice from my chest, I ordered.</p><p>“Soldiers, advance! There are only two days left&nbsp;until&nbsp;we arrive at Dantalian’s stronghold. We shall obtain our spoils of war there!”</p><p>“Yes, your lordship!”</p><p>The commanding officers dispersed&nbsp;and spurred on the rest of the soldiers.</p><p>“Move quickly. Break time is over. Lift your dirty rears&nbsp;and march like ducks!”</p><p>The troops began to move busily. All the soldiers&nbsp;were equipped lightly. We had mobilized lightly equipped troops&nbsp;on purpose in order to end this battle as quickly&nbsp;as possible. It would also be difficult to transport provisions if we did not do this, so it was an obvious tactic.</p><p>I gazed up at the sky and muttered.</p><p>“The weather is nice.”</p><p>The sun was hidden behind clouds. The wind was refreshing. It was the appropriate weather for marching. We will most likely go into battle in two days. Let us quickly sweep Dantalian’s castle and put my land at ease.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day&nbsp;15</p><p>Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle vicinity</p><p>The witches reported that an unknown army was approaching.</p><p>Their military strength, approximately 1,000 soldiers. An army that consisted&nbsp;of solely&nbsp;humans and no demons. According to the&nbsp;witches’&nbsp;assumptions, by the looks of the enemy’s&nbsp;advancing rate, they were&nbsp;going to&nbsp;arrive&nbsp;soon.</p><p>“Did we discover them a bit too slowly……?”</p><p>I muttered dejectedly.</p><p>We had spotted them late. The reason was simple. It was because we had no idea which location the invaders&nbsp;were going to advance from. The note told us&nbsp;that the invaders were going to appear around this time, however,&nbsp;it didn’t tell us exactly&nbsp;who the invaders were and&nbsp;where they were going to attack from.</p><p>The result was this unpleasant situation. We had allowed the enemy forces to arrive right at our&nbsp;noses. It felt like I had become as blind as a bat. Fortunately, we at least had the witches doing reconnaissance from&nbsp;the sky, but if we didn’t have the witches then how late would we have found them……?</p><p>Game and reality were different. In a real-life war, there wasn’t something like a map window that would kindly display, ‘the enemy forces are approaching from this direction’. It was depressing. In the end, I had to go through the cumbersome task of&nbsp;searching for the attackers&nbsp;myself. It was the worst possible condition for a shut-in. Was there no magic spell that wiped out the opposition’s&nbsp;forces in a single hit like in the game? Was there really nothing? I see.</p><p>I wanted to kill myself……</p><p>Ever since the day I fought with Lazuli, I’ve been&nbsp;in a constant despondent mood. Everything in the world was tiresome.</p><p>Why was I still living my life? For someone who had already realized that their life was utter shit since the age of 6, why was I still alive. Am I a masochist?</p><p>……Yes,&nbsp;I knew the truth. Because of my damn personality disorder, as long as I could achieve my goal, I was fine with even massacring children&nbsp;and elderly people. I did not feel a single bit of remorse&nbsp;from that. The very act of turning another person’s life&nbsp;into a puppet and marionetting&nbsp;them&nbsp;to my desire was the joy of my life, and trampling arrogant fools then&nbsp;shoving them into a ditch was the fruit of my life. What was I supposed to do? When I was born, I was born like this.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Regardless, I did try to escape my fate&nbsp;once. After my father had died, I had given up on the inheritance and shut myself away. But for some reason, I fell back into&nbsp;a&nbsp;world that followed the law of the jungle. My life was in that shape and it had come back to this again……</p><p>“Haaa—”</p><p>A sigh came out on its own.</p><p>It was already difficult to live life diligently, but for it to also be difficult to live life lazily? This was indeed my destiny. It was certainly fitting for a life that was utter crap. Everyone should just eat shit.</p><p>Laura De Farnese spoke.</p><p>“Lord, your complexion is&nbsp;unwell. Are you okay?”</p><p>The two of us were currently having a strategy meeting. She was probably concerned&nbsp;since I had abruptly let out a sigh in the middle of our meeting. I looked at Miss Farnese with hollowed eyes.</p><p>“Farnese. When life feels like shit, what do you do?”</p><p>“Mm? What are you talking about? Life has always been shit. Has your lordship, perhaps, ever felt like your life was something besides&nbsp;crap?”</p><p>Miss Farnese blinked at me and I raised my shoulders.</p><p>“Well…… not as of yet.”</p><p>“See. Your lordship sure says useless things. Referentially, this young lady thinks on an average of 2&nbsp;times a&nbsp;day of wanting to kill herself. Suicidal impulses are&nbsp;already a part of this young lady’s life.”</p><p>“I’m a bit less than that. Around an average of 1.5 times a day, perhaps.”</p><p>“I knew it. Is that not similar to that of a normal person’s mentality? Do not worry about pointless things, lord. We’re already fated to swim in a ditch for the rest of our lives anyway. Nothing will change even if your lordship worries.”</p><p>“Mmm.”</p><p>I nodded slowly.</p><p>She was definitely right. Without a doubt, I too am&nbsp;thinking like her so I agree in a present progressive form. But why was I suffering from relapses of depression&nbsp;all of a sudden? I didn’t know what the issue&nbsp;was. Where did the problem start……?</p><p>“…… My mood has become very&nbsp;spoiled. Oh Farnese.&nbsp;Seeing as it has come to this, I’ll have to relieve&nbsp;this stress by crushing the enemy. Let us quickly annihilate every last one of them.”</p><p>“Although this young lady doesn’t have any objections to that suggestion…… Lord? Acting on emotions is an extremely bad habit. Personal feelings only cause people to descend to 2nd&nbsp;rates.”</p><p>“I know that much as well. But what am I to do when I’m unable to improve my mood no matter what I do? I have no other choice but to calm my anger by watching the faces of others in pain.”</p><p>I grumbled.</p><p>Miss Farnese nodded her head reluctantly.</p><p>“Well. This young lady only follows your lordship’s orders. However, if your lordship truly feels that displeased, then why not command the army yourself? Your lordship’s frustration&nbsp;may dissipate further if you were to watch those humans fall&nbsp;by your lordship’s own orders.”</p><p>“It’s fine. The goal of this battle is&nbsp;to awaken your potential. It would be of no use if we put the cart before the horse here.”</p><p>“Your lordship is rather stubborn in peculiar places.”</p><p>Laura De Farnese shook her head.</p><p>“This young lady shall warn your lordship for the final&nbsp;time. There is a chance that this young lady could get all of the troops, that your lordship had&nbsp;hired, annihilated. This young lady is unsure, but there’s the possibility of defeat even if the enemy has 1,000 soldiers while we have 3,000. Is your lordship still okay with leaving the command to such a lady?”</p><p>“Please stop worrying.”</p><p>I pressed down on the top&nbsp;of Miss Farnese’s head.</p><p>It was a weak&nbsp;spot&nbsp;of hers which I discovered during our time spent together,&nbsp;for the past couple of days.</p><p>Miss Farnese swung her arms and squirmed.</p><p>“Ah—, ah—. Lord, not the crown. I don’t like it there.”</p><p>“Listen carefully. It doesn’t matter if all the troops die. The thing this world is overflowing with are soldiers, anyway. If they die then hire new ones, and if they run out then raise more. Your lord has so much gold that it might start rotting.”</p><p>“Ah— hoah, the crown is not alloowed……”</p><p>Miss Farnese melted down to a&nbsp;pulp. She had a perplexed expression on her face as she turned into jelly. For someone who wasn’t ticklish at all, she was a lady with a weird weak spot.</p><p>“However, you’re an individual that is impossible to replace.&nbsp;A&nbsp;personnel that cannot be made no matter how much gold I pour in. Let me ask you here. Do I seem like a person who’d throw away an outstanding individual, who could carry out the task of 500,000 people in the future, just because I felt like losing 3,000 soldiers would be a waste?”</p><p>“Because this young lady lacks military experience……”</p><p>“Damn it, be quiet. I don’t recall giving you the permission to talk back. Just obediently be pressed by me.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Aak—, aak—, aak—. That’s why the crown is cowardly……”</p><p>Hoo.</p><p>Seeing Miss Farnese shrink down&nbsp;like this, a bit of my stress disappeared. Indeed I was a healthy sadist. An exemplary individual.</p><p>Good. I was able to moderately return back to my normal state. The usual me that was unconditionally correct.</p><p>Forget about Lapis Lazuli for now. Immediately deal with&nbsp;these bandits, these half-wit fools,&nbsp;who didn’t know their place and were invading my territory on their own volition. Teach these fools what true etiquette is.</p><p>“De Farnese. Think of this place not as a battlefield, but as a playground. A&nbsp;small amount of 3,000 toys has been placed before you to play with at your own desire.”</p><p>“Hooah…… Toys, is it?”</p><p>“That is so. Treat the&nbsp;lives of these soldiers&nbsp;cheaply. Or&nbsp;simply&nbsp;consider them as mere dots on the map. Do you think I’d punish you for breaking some toys?”</p><p>On a normal occasion, I wouldn’t talk&nbsp;this frankly.</p><p>However, Laura De Farnese and I were similar. We were part of a set of people who were unexceptionably selfish. Limiting it to at least her, I had no inclination to watch my words.</p><p>The other party most likely thought the same.</p><p>“I understand. Then this young lady shall carry out your lordship’s order and<strong>play a bout of soldiers</strong>.”</p><p>Miss Farnese nodded her head.</p><p>“This young lady shall move the vanguard first.”</p><p>She moved the clay doll that was placed on the map.</p><p>The moment she placed the clay figure down with a ‘thud’.</p><p>—The battle commenced.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The Northern Guardian, Margrave of Rosenburg, Georg von Rosenburg</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day&nbsp;16</p><p>Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle vicinity</p><p>“Your lordship. The reconnaissance unit has returned.”</p><p>“The battle is going to start soon. Call me&nbsp;general, not lord.”</p><p>I sternly corrected my&nbsp;adjutant’s mistake.</p><p>Becoming an excellent noble was difficult. In a standard occasion, you had to be immersed&nbsp;in social obligations&nbsp;while also taking care of domestic affairs. While in emergency situations, you had to take charge as the supreme commander in war. Magnanimous and leniency had to coexist with callousness.</p><p>Therefore, one’s&nbsp;title was imperative. There was a spiritual energy in words. People could change freely depending on&nbsp;the name that was placed on them.</p><p>Currently, I was not the sovereign of the duchy of Rosenburg, but the commander of an army of one thousand soldiers. Not his lordship margrave, but a mere general. It was fine to call this&nbsp;the obstinacy of an old man. It was my creed that if one’s name did not stand immediately, then everything else will&nbsp;collapse.</p><p>“Yes. My apologies, general. I&nbsp;shall&nbsp;correct my mistakes from now on.”</p><p>“Good. Give me the report from the reconnaissance team.”</p><p>“They reported that a unit of what is assumed to be the enemy, is blocking the path up ahead.”</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>I opened my eyes wide.</p><p>“Are you telling me that Demon Lord Dantalian has troops under his command?”</p><p>“Yes. However, it is not certain.”</p><p>Not certain? That wasn’t a pleasant phrase to hear. Vagueness was a&nbsp;foe&nbsp;of the military. One must speak with confidence.</p><p>“There were banners spotted&nbsp;at the enemy’s campsite, but the scouts reported that their affiliation was unknown. It seems to be a unit mainly composed&nbsp;of dwarves.”</p><p>“A unit of dwarves from an unknown affiliation, is it……? The numbers?”</p><p>“It is not an impressive amount, general. According to the report, at the very most, there are between&nbsp;100 to 200 soldiers.”</p><p>“I will confirm this with my own eyes.”</p><p>With the mounted troops in tow, I made my way to the front of the army. Shortly after, I could see the enemy campsite stationed at the&nbsp;top of the hilly area. I narrowed my eyes and examined their&nbsp;camp.</p><p>“Mm, I see the reconnaissance team is&nbsp;doing their job properly. The enemy&nbsp;numbers do&nbsp;not reach 200.”</p><p>“That’s what I think as well. Should we send a messenger to see what affiliation those troops belong to?”</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>“There’s no need. Excluding Dantalian, there are no other Demon Lords that reside in this region.”</p><p>“But in the small chance that it’s a completely unrelated unit……”</p><p>“I’m thankful for the advice, but I will have to turn it down. This unit appeared to block our path on the exact day our forces were&nbsp;advancing. There are no coincidences here.”</p><p>Once I responded to him sternly, my adjutant nodded in understanding and backed off.</p><p>Anyway, my mind felt uneasy.</p><p>For the opposition&nbsp;to be stationed in that location meant that they knew&nbsp;of our invasion beforehand. Where could the information have leaked from……</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>No, it wasn’t too late to research this later on. Carelessness must be avoided. We must first get rid of the enemy forces before us.</p><p>“Adjutant, convey my command! Mobilize the cavalry and assault the enemy forces on both sides. Infantrymen, stay on standby.”</p><p>“Roger! Cavalry company, rush their flanks!”</p><p>My&nbsp;adjutant repeated my order in a loud voice. As soon as the command reached the other companies, the buglers blew their horns. A high and valiant sound. This was the horn unique to the northern region of Habsburg. I loved this echo in battlefields.</p><p>My&nbsp;adjutant muttered.</p><p>“The enemy forces must be desperate as well. This might&nbsp;become a difficult battle.”</p><p>Was he showing sympathy for the foe? That would be troubling. Personal feelings were nothing more than luxury&nbsp;items with no meaning on a&nbsp;battlefield.</p><p>I admonished&nbsp;him.</p><p>“But we too, have our own circumstances. Although I feel sorry for Dantalian, there’s no other choice but for us to force him&nbsp;to be our scapegoat.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Hm. Was it unnecessary&nbsp;concern?</p><p>Ο</p><p>10 minutes since blowing the horn.</p><p>My&nbsp;adjutant spoke with a troubled expression on his&nbsp;face.</p><p>“……General. The enemies aren’t retaliating?”</p><p>“Mmm.”</p><p>My face wasn’t much different from my adjutant. Honestly, I was confused.</p><p>Currently, our&nbsp;light cavalry were firing from atop the&nbsp;hill. With crossbows, they were shooting bolts&nbsp;down at the enemy troops.</p><p>The&nbsp;enemy forces’&nbsp;bleeding must have been getting severe, and yet they did not budge an inch. What was going on?</p><p>“Maybe they have some other plot in mind……?”</p><p>“Their intentions are unknown.”</p><p>I creased my brows.</p><p>“If they keep that up then only their casualty will increase.”</p><p>“There’s no movements at all, general. Maybe they’re receiving less injuries&nbsp;than we think they are?”</p><p>“No. There’s a very&nbsp;small&nbsp;chance of that actually being so.”</p><p>Of course, the range and power of&nbsp;crossbows used by&nbsp;cavalries were weaker than the ones used by &nbsp;infantrymen. But they were still crossbows. The concept of absorbing the magical energy from&nbsp;the surroundings to shoot a powerful bolt was still the same. You couldn’t treat this lightly. It’s certainly supposed to be that way, but……</p><p>“General, there’s the&nbsp;chance of an ambush.”</p><p>“On this vast open hill? There are no forests nearby. If they were to hide their troops, then where would they possibly hide them?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>My adjutant shut his mouth.&nbsp;The distraught expression on his face was apparent.</p><p>I didn’t feel the need to&nbsp;reproach him. My adjutant most likely knew full well that there wasn’t something like an ambush. It was just that he couldn’t understand the behavior of the enemy troops and was simply voicing his ‘Perhaps?’.</p><p>“That, well, they seem to be an elite unit. They’ve been under fire&nbsp;for the past 10 minutes, but there are still no signs of movement. General, they aren’t a ragtag group of soldiers.”</p><p>“…… That only brings up further questions.”</p><p>“…… That is true.”</p><p>The enemy forces were receiving a one-sided shower of arrows and yet they stayed adamant.</p><p>Their troops were&nbsp;less than 200. No matter how many crossbows they had, it most definitely wouldn’t be over 100.</p><p>On the other hand, we had 400 sentries. 400 soldiers that would fire in turn,&nbsp;allowing an endless stream of bolts to be shot. They weren’t even worthy as&nbsp;an opponent. A fight between an adult and a child would&nbsp;probably be more vigorous than this.</p><p>Despite that, their infantry&nbsp;continued to maintain their ranks. They kept their chins high, as if their comrades falling by arrows besides them was no big deal. Their courage was abnormal.</p><p>“Normally, we’d compliment them for their impressive military discipline……”</p><p>“……Is this not sad? What makes these men any different from a meat shield?”</p><p>“Yes. This is truly&nbsp;pitiful.”</p><p>My adjutant raised his voice in agreement.</p><p>We watched the battlefield in silence&nbsp;for a while.</p><p>Finally, after 20 minutes into the battle, my adjutant couldn’t contain his anger any longer.</p><p>“I am unable to understand!”</p><p>His face was a bright red.</p><p>He was most likely raging at the unknown enemy commander’s incompetence.</p><p>“What exactly is their commander doing?! Their soldiers are dying. Retaliate, turn the tides of the battle, do something! At the very least they should surrender……!”</p><p>In the end.</p><p>Around the 30 minute mark since the battle began, the enemy forces were finally defeated.</p><p>Unable to withstand the injuries any longer, their ranks fell apart. The sturdy wall had collapsed.</p><p>“…… Give the order to charge.”</p><p>“…… Yes, general.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Both the general giving the order and the adjutant receiving the order were worn out. But, the only ones swallowed up by this somber mood&nbsp;was us two. Our troops were obviously enthusiastic by the easy victory.</p><p><em>Buuuuuu—</em></p><p>The sound of horns resonated.</p><p>Receiving the signal, our troops unsheathed their blades and boldly rushed forwards towards the enemy’s broken ranks.</p><p>It ended with that.</p><p>Unable to withstand our charge, the enemy soldiers quickly collapsed. The dwarves ran away left and right. Because of the much too obvious sequence, and the much too obvious result, the strength in my shoulders disappeared……</p><p>“General. Should we give the order to pursue?”</p><p>“Do it…… I truly can’t understand any of this.”</p><p>The enemy soldiers, unable to have run far, were swept away by our forces. Disturbing screams began to echo throughout the hills. My adjutant narrowed his eyes. It was a gruesome scene……</p><p>“What&nbsp;was that battle just now?”</p><p>“I’d like to ask that as much as you do.”</p><p>There were many mysteries in the world.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day&nbsp;16</p><p>Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle vicinity</p><p>“—I see. I’ve come to a realization.”</p><p>Laura De Farnese’s eyes sparkled.</p><p><strong>“Infantrymen alone are not enough to beat cavalries!”</strong></p><p>“Why are you realizing something that’s obvious!?”</p><p>I shouted with all my strength.</p><p>Steaming with anger, I firmly pressed down on the crown of this lady’s head.</p><p>“Ah—, ah—. I dislike it, lord. I dislike it there.”</p><p>“What was that battle just now? Was it not completely lackluster!?”</p><p>“Hoah—. That’s why this young lady requested for your lordship to not leave the command to this young lady……”</p><p>Miss Farnese spread out like a rice cake under my&nbsp;arm.</p><p>Even if a person&nbsp;had absolutely no experience in war, that battle just now was terrible. There was no end to how horrible it was. We had lost a company of 150 infantrymen in a blink of an eye, without having been able to do anything in return.</p><p>“You disgrace. I retract my previous statement. We are not in the same category of people. You aren’t like my little sister, either. You are nothing more than my personal stress ball.”</p><p>“What’s the difference between that and a sex slave, lord……?”</p><p>“At the very least, sex slave are able to resolve their sexual desires, but you are unable to resolve anything. That’s the tremendous&nbsp;difference. You useless thing.”</p><p>“This young lady abruptly became a girl lower than a sex slave……”</p><p>Miss Farnese became sullen.</p><p>In that last battle, the amount of soldiers that succeeded in escaping did&nbsp;not even reach 20. That meant that 9/10 of the total troops we had sent out had died.</p><p>With Miss Farnese, I&nbsp;had to watch that miserably lackluster scene from start to finish, while riding on one of the witch’s broom. It felt like I was being&nbsp;forced to watch a B-rated movie.</p><p>“Mm. But this is entirely your lordship’s responsibility.”</p><p>“Say that again?”</p><p>“Since this young lady has only read art of war manuals, it is obvious that this lady&nbsp;would be unfamiliar&nbsp;to real battle. In one of the art of war manuals this young lady had read, it was written that infantry&nbsp;were enough to&nbsp;oppose light cavalry. So there&nbsp;was&nbsp;no other choice but for this young lady to verify which books were&nbsp;correct.”</p><p>She was rather shameless for a person who had executed the worst battle in history.</p><p>I glanced at Miss Farnese with sullen eyes.</p><p>“So? Your true intention?”</p><p>“—Since it felt like I’d lose my first battle anyway, this young lady&nbsp;threw out 150 people as disposables to die.”</p><p>“I shall knead that loser mentality of yours.”</p><p><em>Press press press</em></p><p>“Ah, ah ah— I’m being kneaded, looord— Hoah. This young lady is being kneaded……”</p><p>“Try with a bit more enthusiasm. Do you understand? Victory is a maiden. She only smiles upon the bravest of challengers. Victory stays distant from fools that quietly stay huddled in a corner.”</p><p>“The bravest of challengers, is it……?”</p><p>Miss Farnese gazed up at me.</p><p>I sincerely met her gaze with my own.</p><p>“That is so. Boldly act recklessly.”</p><p>“Recklessly……”</p><p>“So daring that it makes you&nbsp;contemplate&nbsp;on whether what you’re doing is truly okay.”</p><p>“Daring……”</p><p>I wonder if my sincerity got across to her.</p><p>Laura De Farnese went into deep thought for a moment before nodding her head. It was a small movement, but there was a certain resolution within it. Since it was I, who was gifted in reading people’s psychology, that was saying this, it was certain.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Understood. It is surely as your lordship has said. This young lady may have been somewhat half-hearted. Because it was this young lady’s first time, because it was an unknown territory, this young lady may have been cautious.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>“In truth, the first time is the moment when one can test the amount of privilege they have.&nbsp;Even if a child were to fall down, there is no person who would blame them for doing so. Although this young lady may be&nbsp;the greatest genius in the world, this young lady is still a mere infant in regards to military affairs. There is no reason to take care of this lady’s pride here.”</p><p>“Mm……”</p><p>“That’s why, this young lady shall follow your lordship’s advice and overturn that way of thinking. This young lady shall even force the enemies to be shocked. It’s fine to have expectations.

That’s precisely the spirit, Laura De Farnese! Did I not assure you that it was fine to use up our soldiers as you please? I shall bear the responsibilities and the losses, while you take the glory and victory. That way there is&nbsp;no lucrative business.”</p><p>“As you command. My lord.”</p><p>Miss Farnese grabbed a clay doll.</p><p>“This is this young lady’s&nbsp;<strong>sincerity</strong>.”</p><p>With a ‘thud’, she placed the clay figure on the center of the map.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The Northern Guardian, Margrave of Rosenburg, Georg von Rosenburg</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day&nbsp;16</p><p>Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle vicinity</p><p>“General. Another corp of enemy troops has appeared in the front.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>I furrowed my brows because of my adjutant’s report.</p><p>After obtaining our incomprehensible victory from this morning —I may have gone through a countless number of battlefields in my life, but this&nbsp;was the first time I’ve ever obtained an ‘incomprehensible victory’ instead of an ‘incomprehensible defeat’— our troops reorganized their ranks and were marching again.</p><p>Normally, it would be appropriate to allow my soldiers to rest after a battle. The fatigue military personnel received while engaging&nbsp;in a battlefield was unimaginable. It was an obvious consideration.</p><p>However, this time I was unable to allow them such leisure. The reason was simple. My voice of reason and common sense fused together and declared&nbsp;that ‘that’ could not possibly be considered as a battle. Since there was no combat there was no rest. There was no hole in my logic.</p><p>But for the enemy troops to appear again? What was he talking about?</p><p>“Give me the full details, adjutant.”</p><p>“Yes. It is estimated that the number of enemy soldiers is&nbsp;approximately around 150 this time as well. They seem to be in a battle formation on top of a relatively tall hill.”</p><p>“……Why wasn’t this unit with the troops we ‘clashed’ with this morning?”</p><p>“My apologies, but I am uncertain of that&nbsp;as well.”</p><p>My adjutant was as confused as I was. It would be difficult to expect&nbsp;a proper answer here.</p><p>With the cavalry following behind me, I&nbsp;made my way to the front. And sure enough,&nbsp;another unit of enemy forces lay ahead. Flags from an unknown affiliation were waving once more.</p><p>However, there was something decisively different about these soldiers compared to the troops we faced this morning.</p><p>“Adjutant. Don’t tell me that’s……”</p><p>“……Yes. General.&nbsp;After seeing it with my own eyes, I’ve come to the realization as well.</p><p>My adjutant murmured.</p><p>“That company, has&nbsp;<strong>nothing but</strong>&nbsp;crossbowmen.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>My vision felt faint.</p><p>In truth, this&nbsp;was an outrageous group.</p><p>It was my first time seeing a unit like this in my entire life.</p><p>Typically, an infantry unit consisted of spearmen and crossbowmen. It wasn’t like that for no reason. There was a rationale&nbsp;for all of this.</p><p>The spearmen used their long spears to prevent the other side’s troops from approaching. When the time came, they would keep their spear heads extended out to prevent things like cavalry from charging in.</p><p>As what happened in this morning’s ‘clash’ —Yes, I plan to use this term persistently— my men did not&nbsp;rush in recklessly from the start. It was because the enemy spearmen were standing their ranks without leaving a single gap. Thus, we had poured arrows down upon them from afar to force an opening in their ranks. The charge happened after that.</p><p>My adjutant spoke sourly.</p><p>“Though it seems they’ve set up wooden spikes&nbsp;around their position……”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>The enemy forces had put down&nbsp;wooden spikes around themselves like a fence, for anti-cavalry purposes. As if&nbsp;they were trying to make up for what they lacked. Certainly, those were effective in hindering&nbsp;our cavalry from approaching, but spikes were inferior to actual puncture wounds. It would be impossible to completely block off our cavalry with just that.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Adjutant. Is that, perhaps, a popular strategy in battlefields nowadays? Since&nbsp;I’ve aged, I’ve been unable follow recent trends.”</p><p>“My apologies, general. If something like that was a trend, then the empire would have united the entire continent long time ago. And I would have lost my job and currently be unemployed.”</p><p>“Should we…… judge it as an original strategy?”</p><p>“You’re quite kind, general. If it were me, I’d express it as nonsense.”</p><p>Overcoming the generation gap, I was able to identify with my adjutant……</p><div></div><p>At that moment, as if my adjutant had realized something, he opened his eyes wide.</p><p>“General. The enemy may be&nbsp;utilizing that kind of strategy involuntarily!”</p><p>“Involuntarily, you say?”</p><p>“Yes. This may be nothing more than&nbsp;my own speculation, but those soldiers over there must have been planning to meet up with the troops we clashed against&nbsp;this morning. They most likely intended to face us with these two units together. However, since&nbsp;their joining together was delayed, they ended up being defeated beforehand!”</p><p>“Hm……”</p><p>It felt like my vision had brightened. That was certainly possible.</p><p>“I see. Was that what it was…… That would explain why the troops we faced this morning did not retaliate. They were waiting for their reinforcement to arrive.”</p><p>“That is so, general. And we had arrived before their troops could join forces. They probably didn’t&nbsp;expect&nbsp;we would advance so quickly. It must have been completely out of their prediction.”</p><p>“Surely.”</p><p>At last, everything made sense.</p><p>The ‘clash’ this morning was simply the enemy’s mistake. They were engaged&nbsp;before their forces could properly gather together. In conclusion, it resulted in their exceedingly eccentric and ridiculous defeat.</p><p>Certainly, the enemy soldiers this morning most likely didn’t&nbsp;have their&nbsp;commander present. At the time, they were probably earnestly waiting for their commander and reinforcements to arrive. But in the end, their commander wasn’t able to arrive on time and their entire unit ended up being annihilated……</p><p>“This is all thanks to your insight, general! If you had organized our troops to mainly consist of heavy infantry and heavy cavalry, then our marching speed would have slowed down that much as well. We would have presumably arrived at the battlefield after the enemy units had joined together.”</p><p>“Mm, that is just luck.”</p><p>“They say that if a coincidence happens twice then it is destiny. There is no doubt that the Goddesses are looking after you, general. Ooh, Goddess Athena’s blessing is upon us!”</p><p>My adjutant became excited and exclaimed.</p><p>Soldiers had the tendency to rely heavily on religion because of their rough experiences in the battlefield. There was nothing that could put more courage into troops than the knowledge that the Goddesses were on their side. That was why my adjutant, who knew of this fact, was shouting enthusiastically.</p><p>“Goddess Athena has given our lordship, Rosenburg, her divine protection!”</p><p>“What’s the matter?”</p><p>At the mention of the Goddess’ name, the other commanding officers gathered.</p><p>Once my adjutant energetically explained to them the situation, their faces also bloomed brightly.</p><p>“Congratulations, your lordship!”</p><p>“It is clear that the Goddesses desires to protect your lordship’s land from the Black Death!”</p><p>The other commanding officers gave their congratulations as if we had already obtained victory.</p><p>With a cold expression, I shook my head.</p><p>“Silence. It is too soon to be celebrating our victory when the enemy is still there before us. It wouldn’t be too late to share a toast after&nbsp;we’ve returned to our land.”</p><p>Although, I too was delighted, this was being hasty.</p><p>The battle wasn’t over yet. The fight went on&nbsp;until we’ve defeated the enemy and returned back to our homes. Carelessness called upon an unforeseen ruin.</p><p>“You all, return to your units and organize the ranks! Stay on standby until the sound of the horn.”</p><p>“Yes, general!”</p><p>The commanding officers responded promptly. They had immediately understood my intent. Indeed they were competent. Their wages weren’t high for no reason. They were a reliable bunch of personnel.</p><p>“Adjutant. Give the order for the cavalry company to charge. Teach the enemy&nbsp;crossbowmen&nbsp;that something trivial like spikes are pointless resistance&nbsp;by&nbsp;leaping&nbsp;over them&nbsp;with our&nbsp;horses.”</p><p>“I shall convey your command. We shall make sure to beat those bastard dwarves until their bottoms turn red.”</p><p>After the sound of the horn, our cavalry rushed forward.</p><p>A portion of our&nbsp;cavalry were dismounted&nbsp;by the enemy’s volley, but that was it.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Our troops skillfully avoided the wooden spikes and trampled the enemy forces.</p><p>‘It’s over.’</p><p>This content feeling took a load off of my mind.</p><p>With this, all of Demon Lord Dantalian’s troops were exhausted.</p><p>Now there was no more obstacles to stop our advance.</p><p>Let us march with light steps.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day&nbsp;16</p><p>Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle vicinity</p><p>Ο</p><p><strong>“I will knead you.”</strong></p><p>“Hoack, ackack—ah, ah—, you can’t.

That goes beyond being creative&nbsp;and is plainly dropping our forces into a pile of shit!”</p><p>“Ack—, to breathe down on the crown, that sort of cunning high level technique…… This young lady cannot hold on any longer…… this young laady, ah—, this young lady is being kneaded by her lord……”</p><p>What was there to hide?</p><p>Following the 1st unit, the 2nd unit was cleanly wiped out as well. Each company had 150 soldiers. Miss Farnese had sent a total of 300 elite troops off into space in just a quarter of a day. Was this not an impressive ability?</p><p>“You could have just utilized our entire forces at once and ended it, but why did you send out small bits of 150 soldiers at a time!? Are you a masochist? Laura De Farnese, were you part of the group of people who received pleasure from pushing themselves into delicate situations? If you desire for pain that much, then I can personally show you Heaven. Aaang? Is it here? Is this your weak spot?”</p><p>“No…… any further, hoah—, reaaaaally……”</p><p>Miss Farnese spread out completely like jelly.</p><p>Her blonde hair was messy like a rice cake. I stopped here.</p><p>After being a pulp for a long period of time, Laura De Farnese muttered.</p><p>“But this is strange. According to this young lady’s calculation, they&nbsp;should have&nbsp;at least been able to defend against&nbsp;the cavalry.”</p><p>“The thing that’s strange is your head. You idiot.”</p><p>“This is the first time this young lady has ever been called an idiot in her entire life. This young lady has always been curious as to how&nbsp;people, who were constantly called fools, felt like. But after being called&nbsp;it herself,&nbsp;it is incredibly depressing. I want to kill myself……”</p><p>With a tearful expression, Miss Farnese fixed her hair and spoke.</p><p>“……It seems the enemy cavalry were&nbsp;not riding normal horses but the&nbsp;improved breed of horses, warhorses.”</p><p>“Warhorses?”</p><p>“Mm. A breed that is born by cross breeding a centaur and a horse. This young lady has&nbsp;heard that compared to normal horses, warhorses do not fear edged objects or avoid flames. Referentially, although warhorses are considered to be the core of the Kingdom of Brittany’s&nbsp;militia, the enemy do not seem to be from there.&nbsp;Since it was written in a&nbsp;book this young lady had&nbsp;read that a Brittany warhorse was as large as an orc.”</p><p>“I couldn’t care less about your boast of knowledge. Show results. Results!”</p><p>I uttered.</p><p>“The thing that I scorn the most in the world is sacrifice without growth. Do not tell me that after 300 deaths, you were&nbsp;still unable&nbsp;to go through any growth?”</p><p>“How cheap. You even told me to treat them like toys……”</p><p>“I meant that you should&nbsp;at least play within the realm of common sense&nbsp;that people can comprehend.”</p><p>Laura De Farnese stared straight at me.</p><p>“Lord, is it not fun?”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“This young lady is having fun. It really feels like I’m playing as a sergeant.”</p><p>Miss Farnese spoke.</p><p>Although the focus in her emerald colored eyes was still hazy, there was a tint of more liveliness within them than usual.</p><p>“Honestly, this young lady&nbsp;was surprised. Your lordship had instructed this young lady to treat the lives of the soldiers&nbsp;like toys, but it was a question on if that was possible for this young lady. Separate to the absence of an organ called conscience within this young lady, this young lady still has an understanding of the concept&nbsp;of ethics and moral. This young lady believes that true joy comes from the euphoria of the brain. So the question was&nbsp;if this young lady’s body would accept an action that went against this young lady’s rationality as happiness……”</p><p>Miss Farnese smiled faintly.</p><p>Truthfully, it was too ungainly to even be considered as a smile.</p><p>It was like a machine imitating a human, there was an absence of a soul.</p><p>A smile that merely followed the gesture of ‘raising the corners of your mouth’.</p><p>Despite that.</p><p>“—It was enjoyable beyond this young lady’s imagination.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>That was currently Laura De Farnese’s best.</p><p>“It was the complete opposite. Treating another person’s life like a toy is&nbsp;<strong>the most interesting recreation in the entire world.&nbsp;</strong>As much as when I read a historical book, no, it might have been more exciting than reading a historical book. It’s wonderful. This young lady has never felt like this before……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>I grinned.</p><p>With a soft touch, I patted Miss Farnese’s head.</p><p>“Indeed, you are the same as I, De Farnese. That emotion. Do you know what people call that pleasure?”</p><p>“No, I do not know.”</p><p>Miss Farnese shook her head.</p><p>“Please tell me, lord. Enlighten this ignorant young lady. What this eerily pleasant feeling is called. What does this young lady call this joy that feels like it’s oozing from this young lady’s heart and enveloping her chest?”</p><p>“Some people call it possessive instinct. Other people refer to it as a will to control. And slightly more intelligent individuals refer to it as the process of satisfying one’s&nbsp;own superiority. However, if I were to say it in&nbsp;<strong>my language</strong>, then it would be much more intuitive and is even a single word at that.”</p><p>“What would that be?”</p><p>“It’s authority.”</p><p>I stroked her cheek.</p><p>Laura De Farnese’s expression became dazed as if she was struck by lightning.</p><p>“Authority……”</p><p>“That is so. Authority, my companion. As it is the driving force behind the eternal bloodshed in our&nbsp;world, it is also my personal reason to keep living this damn life of mine.”</p><p>“Authority. Is your lordship living your life in order to enjoy authority to its fullest?”</p><p>I laughed.</p><p>If this was Lapis Lazuli, then she would&nbsp;have never&nbsp;asked&nbsp;this sort of question in the first place.</p><p>Because it was such a self-evident fact.</p><p>“Think about it, De Farnese. The smell of blood is rancid. The smell of internal organs is so disgusting&nbsp;that it makes you want to vomit. But despite all that, have you truly never considered why people still indulged in endless murder and slaughter? It is because the sweetness of authority is&nbsp;so blissful that it overwhelms the vile stench of blood.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Aah. Of course. A person who has never had a proper taste of this particular delicacy are&nbsp;unable to understand. They truly cannot fathom it.&nbsp;Just like you, Farnese, who did not know of this feeling for the 16 years of your life……”</p><p>Laura De Farnese was a love-child.</p><p>She had spent nearly her entire life confined in her room.</p><p>The place this girl escaped to within her abuse and captivity was the library.</p><p>She had protected her&nbsp;own ego&nbsp;by exiling herself into the world of books.</p><p>The universe inside the books was soon her own universe.</p><p>In that process, the method of making facial expressions, the instinct of focusing one’s&nbsp;eyes, and even the technique of raising and lowering one’s voice, she had forgotten everything.</p><p>Essentially.</p><p>…… From a third person perspective, she was nothing more than a person who had failed tremendously in adjusting to the world.</p><p>In her perspective, it was the complete opposite, as all of her effort and sacrifice had gone into adjusting to her own world.</p><p>Laura De Farnese’s infatuation with history was not a coincidence either. The inner desires she had, the impulse that should be simply referred to as her instinct, was reflected after being ‘distorted once’.</p><p>Because every existing&nbsp;historical event was a&nbsp;<strong>history of authority</strong>.</p><p>Until now, Miss Farnese had lived her life unaware of what kind of person she originally was, and what sort of blood flowed through her veins.</p><p>“Do you not desire for more?”</p><p>Therefore.</p><p>The role I was given for this girl was already determined.</p><p>A devil tempting a pure maiden.</p><p>“Do you not desire more for what&nbsp;you’ve already tasted once? To once again control people, put people to death. Do you not desire to feel as if you are omnipotent?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“You are a slave. But I will tell you what kind of slave you shall become from this point on. It is not something like a sex slave. Never would that be so. If you were to become a sex slave then you will have no other choice but to be chained down by me. De Farnese. You can only become a slave to authority.”</p><p>I passed my hand over Miss Farnese’s mouth.</p><p>Brushing&nbsp;the tips of my fingers over her soft lips.</p><p>“Any other type of slave will bind you down, but a slave to authority is different. Authority will set you free. If you wish to become the master of authority then&nbsp;the only path you can take is to become a slave of&nbsp;authority first! This is the land that freedom lives and breathes. Therefore, this is a kingdom where the slaves soon become the master, and masters become the slaves.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I had presented a proper milestone to my still young junior.</p><p>Similar to the time that I had kindly taught this to my younger step-siblings.</p><p>…… Unfortunately, my siblings were not the same as me.</p><p>Regardless, I was certain that this girl in front of me was going to walk the same path&nbsp;which I had walked and was still walking.</p><p>Sure enough.</p><p>“…… Haa, aaah.”</p><p>Miss Farnese let out a breath.</p><p>It was a breath that contained the warmth of&nbsp;her heart.</p><p>“Lord.

Her heated breaths were more&nbsp;proof than anything else of her sincerity.</p><p>One’s expression was minor, anyway. Was Lapis Lazuli not always expressionless, and yet was more taken in by the desire for power than anyone else? Authority had leaped over emotions long ago, and was much too&nbsp;<strong>deep</strong>&nbsp;to express with one’s face.</p><p>“Do you feel like you are alive?”</p><p>“Yes, lord.

How would I possibly live in this world with such a substandard brain. It would only be appropriate to bite my tongue and kill myself. A 6-year-old child would probably be more intelligent than I was.</p><p>“Lord?”</p><p>My senses quickly returned by Miss Farnese’s call.</p><p>She was staring vacantly at me.</p><p>“Are you all right? Your lordship had stopped talking all of a sudden and started to tremble. If perhaps, your lordship desires to use the bathroom, then do not mind this young lady and go.”</p><p>Miss Farnese placed both of her hands on&nbsp;her chest.</p><p>It was over her heart.</p><p>“The words your lordship wish to convey&nbsp;to this young lady, has properly reached all the way here. In a small but distinct form.…… This young lady won’t ever forget your lordship’s words till the day she dies.”</p><p>Ο</p><p><strong>[Your devilish eloquence has captivated the other party!]</strong></p><p><strong>[Laura De Farnese’s affection went up by 24!]</strong></p><p>Ο</p><p>With startled eyes, I looked at her.</p><p>Honestly receiving my gaze— Laura De Farnese beamed brightly.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“That’s why, it’s fine to go and come back.”</p><p>Although it was still a clumsy imitation of a smile, her feelings were properly contained within it.</p><p>It was the first time since she was born that she had smiled on her own volition.</p><p>“Do not worry about the battle. The tests are over. Verifying which aspect of which art of war manual&nbsp;is correct, is complete. Now all this young lady has to do is simply apply this knowledge accordingly.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>I slowly stood up.</p><p>Even after lifting myself up, I walked back and forth in my spot for a while. What I planned to do from now on was sorted out in my head. Miss Farnese was looking at me as if I was strange, but I was not concerned.</p><p>Since the contemplation was long, the decision was firm.</p><p>“I’ll be right back.”</p><p>In the end, I was not someone with an indecisive and hesitant personality. By nature, I despised that kind of behavior. Striking while the iron is hot had the best taste.</p><p>“Mm. It seems your lordship has the tendency to hold it in till the very end before using the bathroom. Take your time—.”</p><p>I could not hear the rest of what Miss Farnese had said. I was already making a mad dash back to my Demon Lord castle. Since our military headquarters was set up outside, I had to run for a fair amount of time before reaching the castle.</p><p>I wonder how much I had run. It was clear that I ran&nbsp;long enough that it would be considered excessive for the pitiful stamina of a shut-in. Honestly, it would have been more convenient if I had asked one of the witches from the Berbere Sisters to give me a lift, but I had realized this fact later on. To be exact, I had realized this fact after I arrived in front of Lapis Lazuli’s office in my castle.</p><p><em>Bang</em></p><p>“Lala!”</p><p>I slammed open the door.</p><p>Thankfully, Lapis Lazuli was in her office. Except, the timing wasn’t that great. In truth, it was really bad. Lapis Lazuli was half nude and changing her black stockings. No, if anything, wasn’t this a good timing?&nbsp;I’m not sure.</p><p>“……”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli looked this way and let out a small sigh.</p><p>“Your highness. Has this one not informed your highness many times before to knock on the door before entering this one’s room?”</p><p>“Wait. Listen to what I have to say from there.”</p><p>I took a deep breath.</p><p>Because I had run so recklessly, my chest was burning more than necessary. I wheezed roughly. A lot of time was needed before my breathing settled&nbsp;down. This was why I hated intensive exercise. It stole one’s composure. I was always cool-headed and calm.</p><p>“……Surely, did your highness run all the way here? This is surprising. Until now, this one had always assumed&nbsp;that your highness only knew&nbsp;how to walk and lie down and no other body movements.”</p><p>“Listen carefully, Lala.”</p><p>I straightened my back.</p><p>And using both my hands, I utilized all kinds of gestures.</p><p>“What we need right now is dialogue. The need for us to reach mutual understanding through complex and delicate, but essential, dialogue is urgent. This is a very grave political matter, as well as it is a core issue more important than anythin</p>"

Our front is completely clear, general.”</p><p>My adjutant responded with a delighted face.</p><p>It wasn’t only my adjutant. The soldiers around me were all cheerful as well. Soon after, our forces safely arrived at Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle.</p><p>Initially, we were constantly cautious of our surroundings.</p><p>It was because after the hilly area, a vast forest was spread before us.</p><p>Contrary to hills, ambushes&nbsp;were more than possible within a forest. You could not eliminate the chances of an enemy ambush. To send out a small unit on purpose to be defeated, and then to aim an ambush at us while we were being careless…… In simpler terms, a standard deception tactic. Even if this was&nbsp;a thousand to one chance, I was not going to overlook the possibility of an ambush.</p><p>“Indeed, it seems the entirety of Dantalian’s military forces was&nbsp;wiped out yesterday.”</p><p>“Yes. Although I was doubtful at first, it appears&nbsp;it was a pointless worry.”</p><p>After passing through the forest, a fairly massive rocky mountain laid&nbsp;in front&nbsp;of us.</p><p>Within sight was a barren mountain containing nothing but stone. Vegetation was unable to grow on Demon Lord Castles mainly due to the excessively powerful magical energy that emitted from them. It was certain that the mountain before us was Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle.</p><p>“Our scouts found the entrance to the cave.”</p><p>“Mm, proceed with the plan.”</p><p>As we had previously arranged, a detached force entered the cave. It was a procedure to confirm whether&nbsp;if there were&nbsp;truly black herbs piled up inside the castle.</p><p>It was fine if there were&nbsp;actually&nbsp;no&nbsp;herbs. This was nothing more than action taken to show to my&nbsp;people that we weren’t standing by idly. If there were herbs then it was good fortune, if there weren’t then it wasn’t a big deal. It was at that level.</p><p>3 hours later, the detached troops ended their search and returned. My adjutant gave me the report with an excited voice.</p><p>“General, they say that they’ve discovered 6 wagons worth of black herbs!”</p><p>“What!?”</p><p>It was a surprising result.</p><p>In utter disbelief, I stood up and walked forward, and sure enough, the detached troops were transporting the black herbs while rejoicing. Seeing the detached troops, all 1,500 of my soldiers cheered. It felt like it had become a festival.</p><p>Currently, black herbs were being sold for over 10 gold a piece in the empire. It was at least 10 gold! Depending on the region and market price, the asking price would even go up to 20 gold. Before I knew it, my mouth was hanging agape.</p><p>“Dear Lord. God Hades……”</p><p>How much would 6 wagons worth of herbs cost? In total, there were probably around 7,000 plants. 70,000 gold…… The budget processed by the imperial family of the&nbsp;empire in a single year was about 500,000 gold. Thus meaning, I&nbsp;had obtained in my&nbsp;hand 1/7 of the national budget required to manage the entire empire annually!</p><p>“It is the greatest of success, your lordship!”</p><p>My adjutant shouted fervently.</p><p>“Now the territory of Rosenberg will survive. No, it isn’t on the level of just living! The people will venerate your lordship as a saint blessed by the Goddesses!”</p><p>“That is so. We can save all of my&nbsp;citizens who are suffering from this mysterious disease……”</p><p>My chest swelled with delight.</p><p>How many of my subjects were in pain. How many people sent their prayers up to the Goddesses, and how many times did the Goddesses cruelly return to them silence.</p><p>Two of my grandchildren died from this illness. One of them was a child who was only 6-years-old……</p><p>My chest throbbed at the memory of my grandchild’s blackened corpse. At that time, my daughter had held her child’s body while wailing in pain. A little bit more, if I had invaded this place a little sooner, then my daughter wouldn’t have had to lose her child……</p><p>“Your lordship, what do you mean by saving all of the citizens?”</p><p>My adjutant questioned.</p><p>“Surely we should sell them at the proper price.&nbsp;Merely releasing this supply to the market would be enough to receive great praise from all of your subjects.”</p><p>“No. We shall provide the herb for all of those who are ill&nbsp;for free.”</p><p>I declared this after letting my emotions calm down.</p><p>Starting from my adjutant, all of my company commanders&nbsp;as well looked at me with shocked expressions on their faces.</p><p>“That’s unthinkable!”</p><p>“Good fortune has fallen upon myself twice during this expedition. The first was my territory being fortunately adjacent to Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle. The second was that we were able to divide and conquer the enemy troops before they were able to join forces.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The fact that we were able to obtain the spoils of war today was solely&nbsp;because the Goddess had allowed us to. You should not forget that.</p><p>“If the Goddess has bestowed upon me fortune, then my role is to bestow that fortune down onto my subjects. The glory from God must be glory for all. Is that not right, gentlemen?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>My adjutant and company commanders&nbsp;glanced at one another.</p><p>Moments later, my adjutant earnestly lowered one knee and knelt down before me.</p><p>“This one has pledged allegiance to your lordship.”</p><p>The company commanders&nbsp;lowered their heads one by one. This wasn’t simply a body gesture done by soldiers to show politeness to their sovereign. Unrelated to a contractual relationship, this was a sign of respect between warriors. I personally raised each and every one of them to stand properly.</p><p>“Tell this to the rest of our soldiers. That every single military personnel here will equally be distributed&nbsp;a herb, and that once we return to our land, I shall treat everyone to pork and beer.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>If a noble such as myself were to receive respect, then in return, I had to gift them not with&nbsp;words, but with commodities. Anyone could show gratitude with words.</p><p>Words that drifted in empty space were like a rampart built&nbsp;out of air. The slightest wind could topple it down. Loyalty came from money. There was no reason to be ashamed&nbsp;to admit this.</p><p>“Then we shall move the powder kegs, your lordship.”</p><p>“Mm. Do that.”</p><p>“Yes. Transport the barrels!”</p><p>The soldiers carefully carried the&nbsp;powder kegs from the&nbsp;cart.</p><p>Since there was the danger of these exploding while being mishandled, 4 mages stuck to them and kept a close eye. It was obvious. If an accidental explosion were to occur, we would all be dead. Even the smallest amount&nbsp;of negligence was not allowed.</p><p>The mages had spent this entire expedition safeguarding the powder kegs. They could&nbsp;have been utilized as Aerial Mage Forces, but thankfully there wasn’t a battle fierce enough that required for them to be sent out.</p><p>(TL note: I made a mistake in the translation. “Aerial Demon Forces” was actually just “Aerial Mage Forces”. Demon and Magic uses the same letter of 마)</p><p>Mages. In other words, Aerial Mage Forces, were an incredibly valuable military strength. Only they could dominate&nbsp;the skies. It was fortunate&nbsp;that we didn’t lose even a single mage in this expedition. Truly. There were many luxuries that could be considered as fortunate……</p><p>“Your lordship, we have placed all the powder kegs within the cave.”</p><p>“Good. Detonate them carefully. Make sure to place your own safety at the highest priority.”</p><p>“Yes! Detonate the explosives!”</p><p>The mages aimed at the cave entrance and shot a fire elemental spell&nbsp;in sync. The maximum range of magic spells was 50 meters. The fireballs&nbsp;flew a reasonable distance away and exploded within the cave.</p><p>Booooooom—</p><p>The loud sound of a blast reverberated and shook the rocky mountain.</p><p>Gunpowder made from charcoal and potassium nitrate. And along with those, the barrel contained lumps of metal and stone as well. Although it was troubling to use in an actual battle, it was useful in bringing down enemy strongholds like this.</p><p>Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle came down before my eyes. Albeit, it was impossible to bring down an entire mountain, so merely the cave entrance had collapsed. I was still satisfied with just that.</p><p>My adjutant let out a moved voice while watching the spectacle of the&nbsp;foot of a mountain collapsing.</p><p>“That’s amazing.”</p><p>It was indeed so. It was an expedition that was perfect from beginning to end.</p><p>Now it should be impossible for Demon Lord Dantalian to make a comeback. Not only did&nbsp;he lose all of his troops, but he had lost his stronghold as well. Margrave of Rosenberg’s security measures were thus completed.</p><p>There was no pitying emotion within me. This was the law of the jungle. It was obvious that humans would be hostile towards demons. Obediently accept your defeat, oh weak Demon Lord.</p><p>“All troops! Let us return home!”</p><p><em>Buuuuuuu</em></p><p>The buglers, in the excess of mirth, blew the horns powerfully.</p><p>Receiving the refreshing midday sunlight, my soldiers moved with gusto. Since the wind was also blowing coolly, it was perfect.</p><p>Was that it. Was it already autumn……</p><p>The leaves turned red and the farmers stepped out onto the fields. It was the season where all beings&nbsp;harvested their own lives.</p><p>Indeed, my life forwarding through battlefields and arenas for more than 50 years was the same.</p><p>I wished to fall in a battlefield.</p><p>I wished to be laid to rest with the other warriors.</p><p>But……</p><p>‘Thank you, Your Grace. Oh Great Gods.&nbsp;To allow this unworthy man&nbsp;the opportunity&nbsp;to leave something behind for his&nbsp;people&nbsp;within his lifetime.&nbsp;I could only be grateful.’</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I gave a prayer to the gods within my mind.</p><p>If perhaps, after giving my people the cure, after saving my land, was I then allowed to slowly close my eyes. If that was my fate, then that too was not bad.&nbsp;Indeed, it was not bad.</p><p>It would be leaving behind hope for the new age and the new generation.</p><p>Was it not a remarkable final role given to an old man?</p><p>“General! The reconnaissance team has returned urgently!”</p><p>As I was contemplating how I would split the inheritance to my sons and daughter, my adjutant gave a report. His voice was rather high. For some reason, a perplexed complexion had taken over his face. The reconnaissance team? There shouldn’t be anything worth reporting urgently at this point.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“Enemy forces have appeared! Enemy troops have been spotted up ahead!”</p><p>At my adjutant’s cry, the surrounding air&nbsp;became cold. I could sense&nbsp;that the soldiers around us were surprised and staring at the adjutant.</p><p>I too was shocked, but I had deliberately maintained a calm face. If the commander shook with anxiety, then that anxiety would instantly spread to all of the troops. In other words, it was a disease more terrifying than the Black Death.</p><p>Mm. It seems a change of ambience was required here.</p><p>“Be calm! Have you already forgotten? Our war does not end until we return home. As long as the battle is not over, the enemy can appear from anywhere! This is obvious. What reason is there to start a commotion!?”</p><p>“M-My apologies.”</p><p>Once my adjutant lowered his head, the troops that were about to be unsettled&nbsp;quickly held their breath. My adjutant had received the scolding in the other soldiers’ stead. This as well, was an adjutant’s crucial role.</p><p>“Give the report in more details. Tell me where the enemy forces are located and their approximate military strength.”</p><p>“Yes, general. The enemy forces are stationed on the hill area, which our troops&nbsp;had passed through yesterday. Their numbers reach approximately 3,000!”</p><p>“……!”</p><p>I&nbsp;was barely able to restrain myself from opening my eyes wide.</p><p>The feeling of blood being drained out of my body engulfed me. The reason why I was able to maintain my composure was solely because I had spent my entire life in battlefields and arenas. If I did not have these experiences, then I would have most likely screamed in an unseemly manner.</p><p>“Did you say 3,000&nbsp;just now?”</p><p>However, I was unable to completely control the urgency in my voice. The mood was bad. I could feel the dismay of the soldiers around me. I could even see the pale face of a company commander……</p><p>“Yes. The reconnaissance team had clearly reported that it was 3,000.”</p><p>Be&nbsp;composed.</p><p>There was always the chance that the report was wrong.</p><p>I had gone through something like this in the past.&nbsp;After finding out the fact that the enemy force, who we were brutally fighting throughout the whole night, had a military strength 3 times smaller than our own, all tension in my chest had disappeared. A human’s five senses were not always accurate. It was still too soon to fall into panic.</p><p>“Mm.&nbsp;That’s rather hard to believe. For now, I shall give an order to all of the troops.”</p><p>I made sure to earnestly feign&nbsp;a composed attitude. These soldiers had no other choice but to live their life looking up to me. Without an order, they would be anxious. Meaning, it was possible to erase anxiety with a command.</p><p>“We shall get out of these woods&nbsp;as fast as possible. All military personnel, advance while bearing in mind the chance of battle.”</p><p>“Yes, general! All soldiers! Advance at maximum speed! Advance forward at maximum speed—!”</p><p>Our forces quickly passed through the forest. Two hours later, our troops arrived at the hill region and witnessed a sight that was utterly unbelievable. On the other side of the hill, there truly were a rank of around 3,000 enemy soldiers sternly awaiting for our arrival.</p><p>“General……”</p><p>My adjutant looked at me with a face as pale as marble. Our side’s military strength was approximately 1,400. Compared to the other side, we were smaller by 2 times. Which side would win was obvious. It was clear&nbsp;for the company commanders, and it was evident&nbsp;for the soldiers as well……</p><p>Pull yourself together, Georg. Being able to feign ignorance even in this sort of situation is&nbsp;what a commander is. They must act as if they do&nbsp;not know the truth which everyone else clearly knows. Of course, it was a distressful role. But that was the only way I could take responsibility.</p><p>“Adjutant. Why do you think the enemy forces have appeared there?”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“If they had the military strength of 3,000 soldiers, then it would only be appropriate for them to have appeared sooner. They had plenty of opportunities to wipe us out. However, the enemy troops arrived after we had pillaged and destroyed their stronghold. No matter how you look at it, that is an abnormal usage of troops.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“That…… is true, general.”</p><p>“All forces heed&nbsp;my words!”</p><p>I shouted while straining my neck.</p><p>All of the soldiers turned to look&nbsp;at me at once. This moment was important. This was the only opportunity I had to prevent their fighting spirit from collapsing. Let’s bet the winning move on this.</p><p>“Those enemy soldiers before us have just now arrived on this battlefield! They desired to block us, but we were a step ahead. We had succeeded in bringing down their stronghold!”</p><p>It didn’t matter if this was true or not. To instill vigor into my soldiers, that was my only goal……</p><p>“Rather, return to them loud laughter instead. We have succeeded and they have failed. And above all, we&nbsp;have&nbsp;had&nbsp;sufficient rest so&nbsp;our stamina is firm. But since&nbsp;they have only now arrived on&nbsp;this battlefield, they are still tired! If we attack now then victory will be within our grasp!”</p><p>The soldiers stirred for a moment&nbsp;before eventually,&nbsp;their expressions started to become&nbsp;firm one person at a time. Good. Their fighting spirit was returning to their eyes. Let us go, my northern soldiers. The people await our return!</p><p>“Kick those stubby dwarf bastards on their rears! Beat their buttocks and abuse them! According to rumors, it’s said that dwarves squeal like pigs when mating. Should us humans not kindly teach those livestock what true men are!?”</p><p>The soldiers responded with a roar. Instead of some high-sounding justifications, it was more effective at times to plainly hurl abuses at the enemy. We will not be pushed back in a fight of vigor.</p><p>“Blow the horns of Folles!”</p><p><em>Buuuuuu—</em></p><p><em>Buhuuuuu—</em></p><p>The sound of horns echoed through the vast hills. It was the noise that symbolized the outbreak of war since 700 years ago. That was so. The people of our land&nbsp;had won through 700&nbsp;long years of history and were now here. We will not be defeated easily.</p><p>“All cavalry, charge!”</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day&nbsp;17</p><p>Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle vicinity</p><p>5 minutes had passed since the start of the battle.</p><p>Although temporary, the current situation of the battle&nbsp;was neck and neck. The spirit of the enemy soldiers&nbsp;was rather impressive. However, there was something else that was a bit more impressive. It was Laura De Farnese’s current condition.</p><p>“Miss Farnese, are you okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine. There’s no problem with this young lady.”</p><p>“But you’re sweating quite a lot……”</p><p>Laura De Farnese has been sweating a tremendous amount since a while ago. I was worried that she was nervous, but thankfully that wasn’t the case. It was a type of head&nbsp;heat. According to her, ‘This always happens when this young lady strains her brain.’, is what she told me.</p><p>“The morale in their cavalry regiment seems to be&nbsp;relatively&nbsp;high.”</p><p>“A foolish choice. It would have been better if they had attempted&nbsp;to flee the moment they discovered our troops. Although they would suffer losses during the chase, at least 30 percent of them would have made it back alive.”</p><p>Miss Farnese grinned.</p><p>Her smile was still awkward. The edges of her mouth were stiff and her lips were twitching. And yet, somehow it felt like that smile expressed Laura De Farnese more appropriately. At the very least, it was to my liking.</p><p>“But the enemy did not choose to run. As if it was the most obvious thing to do, they engaged in battle. Do you know the reason behind this, lord?”</p><p>“Probably because of the black herb.”</p><p>“That is correct. If they are able to return with the black herb, then they’ll be able to save their land. It would even be possible to receive praise from the people. The enemy forces are so ensnared in this delusion that they are unable to abandon their wagons.”</p><p>When before a tempting bait, a fish could by all means run away at any time, but they latched onto it anyway.</p><p>Was this not quite the splendid ability?</p><p>Miss Farnese had used the fantasy known as the black herbs as a way to pressure the enemy into combat. The enemy forces most likely did not even realize that they were fooled. They had literally become dim-witted fishes. Our trick had gone over big with them.</p><p>“Now then. Miss Farnese. Although up to here is remarkable,&nbsp;the enemy forces’ morale can not be trifled with. How do you plan to deal with this situation?”</p><p>“Simple. The reason their morale is high is because they are on the offensive. But this young lady is rather egocentric. This young lady&nbsp;cannot allow them to have the exhilarating role for long&nbsp;while on stage.”</p><p>Miss Farnese gripped the clay doll in her hand.</p><p>“—I shall slowly pressure them into a distressful role.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The Northern Guardian, Margrave of Rosenberg, Georg von Rosenberg</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day&nbsp;17</p><p>Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle vicinity</p><p>“General! The enemy cavalry are going around!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>I gazed at the other wing&nbsp;of the battlefield. My adjutant was right. A unit&nbsp;of the enemy cavalry was going a roundabout way around the hill and approaching us. I made a bitter face.</p><p>“Another foolish tactic…… If they had more cavalry in their reserve forces, then it would only be appropriate to have made them participate in the battle immediately. Why would they order something like a flank assault?”</p><p>There was no doubt that the enemy commander was a beginner in tactics.</p><p>Currently, a fierce battle between our and the enemy’s mounted troops was taking place. Our&nbsp;fighting powers were considerably balanced.</p><p>If the enemy were to utilize their reserve forces in this situation, then&nbsp;ten to one we would lose. Our mounted troops would be annihilated, followed by our infantry. Our forces would be utterly defeated. Despite that, their commander had foolishly chosen to use their reserve troops like a detached force.</p><p>“Mmm. Does their commander not have an eye for seeing the flow of battle……?”</p><p>In my position, I could only be grateful. If their forces rushed our flanks, then all we had to do was make our infantry block them. Merely extending our spears would be enough to keep their cavalry at bay.</p><p>Although it was still going to be a tense battle, it was fine. Victory was still within our grasp. We had the ability to come out victorious. The Goddesses have not abandoned us!</p><p>“Infantry company on the right-wing.&nbsp;Ready your spears and spread an anti-cavalry wall. Show those men of reckless valor Hell and……”</p><p>At that moment, something came into my vision.</p><p>The transportation wagons. The wagons loaded to the brim with black herbs were at our rear…… Surely, were they aiming for that!? Were they more desperate to secure&nbsp;their belongings than winning the battle immediately?</p><p>The enemy commander was an avaricious fellow. It was outrageous to be obsessed with money over one’s own&nbsp;victory. But that greed had grabbed us by the ankle……</p><p>I strongly bit my lip and gave an order.</p><p>“…… Focus military strength to the right-wing.”</p><p>“General, then our forces will be thin on both sides!”</p><p>My adjutant was startled.</p><p>“The enemy may be able to break through. Please reconsider!”</p><p>“Adjutant. They are aiming for our wagons. We cannot allow the herbs to be taken here.”</p><p>“……!”</p><p>Those herbs were the future of our land. The life of our&nbsp;children. The hope to cure parents from despairing. Like we’d let these be taken back so easily!</p><p>“Quickly now. If the wagons are assaulted then everything will be over.”</p><p>“Yes, general! As you command!”</p><p>Once the flag signal was sent, our soldiers shifted their&nbsp;focus onto the right-wing. With this, the enemy commander should be discouraged from trying to pillage the wagons. Do not focus your eyes on something like loot and come at us fairly.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day&nbsp;17</p><p>Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle vicinity</p><p>“—War is truly quite enjoyable, lord.”</p><p>Miss Farnese hummed.</p><p>Currently, the enemy’s morale was cut down by a level. Their aggressive behavior had slowly turned into passive behavior. The sharpness they showed at the outbreak of war had already disappeared somewhere.</p><p>“To think that freely controlling people to this young lady’s will would give this much pleasure. This young lady can’t hold it back. Although winning is&nbsp;possible&nbsp;by simply crushing&nbsp;the enemy’s left-wing like this, but…… that would be tasteless.”</p><p>“What do you mean by tasteless?”</p><p>“Obviously, the taste of the dish. Dishes cooked with sincerity are what carries value. Would a dish handled with more haste than caution not be a discourtesy towards the guests?”</p><div></div><p>Miss Farnese spoke in a delighted voice.</p><p>Her face was glowing like a child who was absorbed in their play.</p><p>“This young lady wishes to manipulate a bit more. To brandish a bit more. To enjoy it a bit more. That is why this young lady will not do something tasteless like wiping out the enemy in an instant.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Surely.</p><p>Was that the inclination of the human called Farnese?</p><p>If it were me, I would not think like she did. If the opportunity to crush the other party appeared, then I made sure to tear them apart with no uncertain terms. Should I call it ‘breaking at the onset’? No matter what it was, I enjoyed disposing of it immediately.</p><p>On the other hand, Miss Farnese was part of the faction that enjoyed things leisurely. By giving the other party hope followed by despair and then followed by hope once more, she desired to receive pleasure for as long as possible.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Well, to sum it up, if you were to say that I felt authority when I<strong>&nbsp;saw myself</strong>overwhelming the other party, then you could say that Laura De Farnese felt authority when&nbsp;<strong>seeing the other party</strong>&nbsp;despair because of her. Only the direction was different, but the desire for authority was all&nbsp;the same.</p><p>I let out a small laugh.</p><p>“You’re no different from a child who is completely excited over their&nbsp;new toy. That, once you get bored of it to a certain degree, you’ll end up beginning to handle things quickly like myself. Since now is the most enjoyable time, play as much as you wish.”</p><p>“Mm. Since it’ll be a&nbsp;long time until this young lady&nbsp;begins&nbsp;to tire&nbsp;of this, this young lady is fine for now.”</p><p>“I have clearly given you my warning.”</p><p>I knew that feeling very well, since there was a time I had gone through&nbsp;something similar to what this little lady was experiencing right now.</p><p>Even now, the memory of when I had secretly made 2 male students drop out of school, while I was the school president,&nbsp;was delightful.</p><p>However, doing something like that repetitively only made it dull.</p><p>Although humans grew tired of other people rather quickly, they seldom grew tired of themselves. It was thanks to that principle that I was able to live this long…… Once 7 to 10 years pass, Miss Farnese will naturally come to realize this as well. Please do enjoy your golden days as much as possible.</p><p>Laura De Farnese&nbsp;watched&nbsp;the frontlines with eyes sparkling with anticipation.</p><p>“Ah—, don’t withdraw there. Please rebel against this&nbsp;young&nbsp;lady a bit more. Are you sirs not the valiant soldiers of the Empire of Habsburg? Redisplay the vigor that you’ve shown earlier and force&nbsp;this young lady into more hardship—. Try to rush at this young lady like miserable dogs and make this young lady&nbsp;into a mess—.”</p><p>……Was this a sadist, or was this a masochist?</p><p>I was reassured since I had assumed she was a sadist, but she might unexpectedly be a masochist.</p><p>Was that it? When I pressed down onto the crown of Miss Farnese’s head, was the thing she felt not umbrage but pleasure instead? Did even I, who had the best discerning eye in the world, misjudge her personality? How fearsome. For a healthy sadist like myself, masochists were nothing more than an alien race which I couldn’t understand. It was quite troubling that there were so many unique perverts in the world……</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The Northern Guardian, Margrave of Rosenberg, Georg von Rosenberg</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day&nbsp;17</p><p>Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle vicinity</p><p>……The situation was not good. Our forces were slowly being pushed back.</p><p>Though I wished&nbsp;to do whatever possible in order to turn the tide of battle, we lacked the ability to do so. The enemy stubbornly came at us while aiming for our spoils. Our troops were tied down&nbsp;because of this.</p><p>“It’s like our positions were swapped……”</p><p>“Yes. It’s as if they’re the attackers and we’re the defenders now. At this rate, we can’t make any moves.”</p><p>My adjutant bit his lip. His expression was wretched. Our forces were unable to do this or that, and were&nbsp;instead being dragged around by the enemy.</p><p>Regardless, that wasn’t the most distressful part. In truth, our soldiers were putting up a rather decent&nbsp;fight. That was the case&nbsp;if you at least judged it objectively. They overcame the 2 times difference in military strength and were fighting on equal terms with the enemy troops. This was most likely an impressive feat.</p><p>But slightly.</p><p>Ever so slightly, the sight of us being overpowered haunted my gaze.</p><p>That was the feeling&nbsp;that was pressuring us into a bed of thorns.</p><p>Lament flowed from my lips.</p><p>“…… If our forces were on the offensive then many options would be&nbsp;available to us. At the very least, if our troops were in a clear disadvantage then we could order a retreat.”</p><p>“But it’s difficult to decide on anything in this&nbsp;current situation, general.”</p><p>“That is so. It is problematic.”</p><p>Whether it be victory or defeat, a type of result had to clearly appear in order for us to respond accordingly. And yet, what was this current situation? It wasn’t this way or the other. Only the flow of our military strength being gnawed away ever so slowly continued on……</p><p>I most likely should not&nbsp;order for a retreat in our current circumstances. Our men were currently facing the enemy desperately. The sole thing that was pushing our&nbsp;soldiers from behind was their hope. A little bit more. If they exerted a little bit more, then they may be able to win. This was the hope which was supporting them.</p><p>However, in truth, that ‘little bit’ never diminished below a&nbsp;point. The enemy forces tenaciously held the upper hand, and we were simply&nbsp;pulled along by them. The stamina of our troops was slowly reaching its limit……</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>If I&nbsp;were to order for a retreat now, then&nbsp;at that moment is when our soldiers would&nbsp;truly fall into despair. Their fighting spirit would vanish instantly. That would be the end. Without being able to retreat properly, without being able to even obtain victory, our forces would disgracefully collapse on their own.</p><p>Drosera.</p><p>It felt like we were stuck on&nbsp;a patient sundew. An adhesive-like unpleasant feeling went down my spine. My mouth became dry. The feeling of being neither one thing nor the other, while also being dragged step by step to our destined demise…… this vastly agonizing feeling.</p><p>Was the enemy commander truly a beginner? Were we perhaps caught in a trap? It was a foolish thought, but I was unable to cast away my doubts.</p><p>In the first place, this kind of battle went against my preference. Wreak havoc like a storm and wipe them out. That was the ideal type of battle that I looked forward to. How did it become like this……</p><p>“General. Perhaps this is the enemy’s stratagem?”</p><p>“A stratagem?”</p><p>My adjutant gazed this way with an apprehensive face.</p><p>“I’m referring to the two units that our troops suppressed yesterday. They may have purposely left those units as bait in order to lure us into being careless.”</p><p>“No. That’s impossible.”</p><p>I adamantly shook my head.</p><p>“If you add those two units together then that would be 300 soldiers. If you combined those soldiers with&nbsp;the enemy troops we’re currently facing, then they could have finished&nbsp;us off with ease. Why would they discard their chance of obtaining an easy victory?”</p><p>“That’s right, huh……”</p><p>“Adding to that, we caved in&nbsp;their Demon Lord Castle. If perhaps, our current situation was indeed a trap, then that&nbsp;would be saying that they had allowed us to freely destroy their stronghold. The enemy would gain absolutely no benefit if this were true.”</p><p>There was no mistake. They would only experience losses.</p><p>Their black herbs were plundered and their Demon Lord Castle was destroyed. On a strategic level, the enemy forces have already lost. Even if they were to decimate us here, the enemy troops would be unable&nbsp;to celebrate their victory. To have won the battle, but to have been utterly defeated strategically, that would be the conclusion of this war.</p><p>“……I guess there is no other choice. Let us utilize the mages.”</p><p>“Yes. I as well&nbsp;think that there are&nbsp;no other methods left. If the Aerial Mage Force were to bombard the enemy from the skies with gunpowder, then our situation might&nbsp;turn for the better, even if it is by the&nbsp;smallest amount.”</p><p>The number&nbsp;of mages our forces currently possessed was 4. It was an excessively small number, but it was still enough to cause&nbsp;an impact on the enemy troops. Let us place our faith on this&nbsp;final card.</p><p>“General. The&nbsp;Aerial Mage Force have&nbsp;sortied&nbsp;in formation.”</p><p>My adjutant reported. Once I looked upwards, a group of mages soared&nbsp;through the sky while maintaining a height of 150 meters. Sweat formed on my palms…… Merely 4 mages. However,&nbsp;all 1,500 of our soldiers’ lives were resting on their shoulders. No, if you considered the herbs loaded on the wagons, then the lives of 7,000 people in our land were on their shoulders as well!</p><p>I plead of you. Bring chaos onto the opposing forces!</p><p>You do not have to kill many of them. It would be sufficient to simply plant the fear that ‘Gunpowder and flame are falling from the sky’, into their hearts. A slight disorder. That alone would be enough to create&nbsp;a foundation in order to turn the tides of battle. The mages hastily rushed towards the frontlines. A bit further, a little bit further……!</p><p>“G-General. Look over there.”</p><p>At that moment, my adjutant addressed me. It was a voice drenched in despair.</p><p>“It’s an Aerial Mage Force. The enemy&nbsp;troops&nbsp;have mobilized their Aerial Mage Force as well.”</p><p>“What. That can’t be……”</p><p>Possible. As I was about to finish my sentence, something came into my vision as well. On the other side, a group of hostile mages riding on brooms were approaching from the sky. They were mages with large conical hats worn on their heads.</p><p>“Do not tell me, witches……?”</p><p>My entire body fell into shock.</p><p>Witches, who&nbsp;were granted eternal youth by devoting their souls to Demon Lords, boasted the highest level of proficiency. Furthermore, they were many in number. Compared to our mages, they overwhelmed us.</p><p>“Ten, no, there are eleven. General! The opposing side&nbsp;has a more staggering amount of mage personnel!”</p><p>“That’s not possible. Why are there witches there!?”</p><p>In the center of the sky, our mages clashed against theirs. In a blink of an eye, our mages were hunted down. As if they were playing with toys, the witches killed&nbsp;off our mages&nbsp;one individual&nbsp;at a time. That was not a battle. That was simply a slaughter……</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Our last remaining mage ran away frantically&nbsp;before he was finally shot down. As his limbs were severed, he&nbsp;let out a scream. The chunks of meat, which were broken into small pieces, fell from the sky and towards the ground. Then, the witches celebrated their carnage by spinning around in the sky. My adjutant and I became speechless by the horrendous sight we had just witnessed.</p><p>The witches returned to the enemy campsite as if they were living free from worldly cares. It almost felt like they had come out on a stroll and were heading back now.</p><p>My adjutant looked at me with a face as pale as a corpse.</p><p>“G-General……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Think. Do not panic and concentrate, Georg!</p><p>Why did they send out their witches now? If they had sortied their witches at the start of battle, then they could have wiped us out&nbsp;with much ease. Why did they pull out their trump card now of all times? Is their goal not to eradicate us? What possible meaning could&nbsp;there be…… Wait, what if there was no meaning? What if having no&nbsp;significance&nbsp;was what represented their intentions……?</p><p>I slowly opened my mouth.</p><p>“…… Raise the white flag. We are surrendering.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“The enemy forces do not intend to face us seriously. They are slowly playing around with our troops, while waiting for us&nbsp;to&nbsp;wither away. They are treating us like toys.”</p><p>My jaws trembled because of this wretched emotion.</p><p>“They can demolish&nbsp;us whenever they so desire, however, they are&nbsp;not&nbsp;doing so. It’s because they planned to ridicule us from the very beginning.”</p><p>“That can’t be……”</p><p>My adjutant’s face became stained in anguish. I did not have the energy to reproach my adjutant for making such an expression. The sense of defeat was stabbing my insides.</p><p>“If we were to continue the battle like so, the only thing that’d be left for us is&nbsp;eradication. The only difference is whether we desired&nbsp;to be wiped out sooner, or later. Raise the white flag, adjutant…… We can only hope that they will show a touch of generosity towards us……”</p><p>We sent an envoy to the enemy camp to inform&nbsp;them of our surrender.</p><p>It wasn’t over with this. There was a chance that the enemy would not&nbsp;allow us to&nbsp;surrender. That they would continue to watch over us as we died while trembling in agony.</p><p>Then&nbsp;both retreat&nbsp;and surrender would become impossible. At that point, all that&nbsp;our soldiers&nbsp;could&nbsp;do was&nbsp;resolve themselves to die a dog’s death&nbsp;and fight until the very end. And, as the enemy commander had hoped, we would&nbsp;cry out in pain as we fell into a living hell, until we finally died in battle. An unspeakable impotent feeling weighed heavily&nbsp;on my shoulders……</p><p>Shortly after, our envoy returned.</p><p>Fortunately, it seems the enemy forces had accepted our surrender. Except, on certain&nbsp;conditions.</p><p>To leave behind the black herbs stolen from the Demon Lord Castle, to disarm ourselves, and to leave&nbsp;behind our military regiment’s&nbsp;banners.</p><p>“Are they telling us to give up on our spoils, our arms, and our honor?”</p><p>These were not terms that could easily be accepted. If anything, this was one of the most humiliating types of surrender.</p><p>My adjutant’s voice shook.</p><p>“General. These conditions are too severe.&nbsp;We should just fight until the very end instead.”</p><p>“Then what would remain? We will&nbsp;all perish, and the people of Rosenberg will be engulfed in&nbsp;chaos. We can only endure our humiliation here.”</p><p>“But.”</p><p>“I will accept no arguments.”</p><p>The company commanders&nbsp;dropped their heads. The mood was heavy. It was the mood of people who had lost unjustifiably. It was unimaginable that we would arrive at this sort of situation. For them, and for myself……</p><p>“Notify them that we will accept their conditions.”</p><p>“……Yes.”</p><p>“Raise your heads. You all have done your best to follow me loyally. I am solely to blame for this defeat. You all have done nothing wrong.”</p><p>I pat the shoulder of my adjutant.</p><p>A soft voice, that even surprised me, had flowed&nbsp;from my lips.</p><p>“General.”</p><p>“Do not forget today’s humiliation. Moreover, today will not be the worst day of&nbsp;your lives. You will be able to go home after having barely survived and with your limbs attached. There is nothing more important than this for a soldier.”</p><p>The company commanders&nbsp;nodded their heads with difficulty.</p><p>These men have shown more than enough loyalty to their lord. It was difficult to find soldiers as faithful as them in the empire. Solely being able to send these soldiers back home alive was enough to not discourage me.</p><p>“Now then, let us go. This old man shall take the lead.”</p><p>“Yes, general.”</p><p>The battle was over.</p><p>Our troops advanced&nbsp;forward while in a column formation. We had left behind our weapons.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The majority of our&nbsp;soldiers refused to throw away their trivial weapons,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;daggers and knives, but there was no&nbsp;one&nbsp;who had&nbsp;an issue with this. We had discarded all of our crossbows and spears.</p><p>Our steps should have been as light as the amount of heavy equipment&nbsp;we had lost, but the atmosphere around our troops was heavy to no bounds. Everyone was silent.</p><p>The enemy’s troops&nbsp;were spread out on both sides of the hill. It felt like a sea that was divided&nbsp;in half. They were most likely telling us to go by obediently. I grudgingly ground my teeth by this path guiding that felt like they were mocking us.</p><p>‘One day I will get my revenge.’</p><p>I will thus give up upon the life of dying on my bed&nbsp;submissively.</p><p>Demon Lord Dantalian. Within my lifetime, swearing on my name, Georg von Rosenberg, I shall absolutely&nbsp;avenge myself for today’s defeat. Ten times, no, I shall repay you by twenty times the amount and watch as you plea for forgiveness&nbsp;on the floor!</p><p>If I am determined, then I could gather ten thousand soldiers. It wasn’t impossible to also request for assistance from the other margraves in the vicinity, and raise the troops up to twenty thousand.&nbsp;Eradicating something like a rank 71st Demon Lord was an effortless task.</p><p>Someday. Once the Black Death has calmed and my land has reached a certain point&nbsp;of stability, I shall return.</p><p>It was at that moment, while I was trudging forward with the remnant of my&nbsp;troops.</p><p>“……?”</p><p>Something was caught in my line of sight. At the top of the hill. Thinking that I had seen&nbsp;wrong, I furrowed my brows and became speechless.</p><p><strong>An angel was standing atop of the hill.</strong></p><p>An indescribably beautiful girl was standing there.&nbsp;She was so charming&nbsp;that it made me, who was at the age where I should be preparing for death,&nbsp;think so as well. I stared at her vacantly before I quickly shook my head as if I was shuddering.</p><p>Calm down. There was no reason for an angel to be reflected in my eyes, right?</p><p>I was too stained with reality to believe that an angel could have suddenly descended down onto the earth. Let’s just think of it as having seen an incredibly elegant girl.</p><p>“……”</p><p>At that moment, the girl sent a modest greeting towards this direction. She slightly raised the edge of her coat and bent her waist. It was a style&nbsp;of greeting that was perfectly faithful to the ways of nobility.</p><p>‘Surely, that isn’t a greeting towards me?’</p><p>In order to examine the girl closely, I blinked my eyes several times.</p><p>And at the moment I looked again at the distant hill.</p><p>—I witnessed.</p><p>“…………”</p><p><strong>A devil was smiling behind the girl.</strong></p><p>Although I have never witnessed the existence known as the&nbsp;devil in my entire life, &nbsp;‘what’ exactly people referred to when calling something the devil, I now understood in this moment.</p><p>“All……”</p><p>Every single nerve in my body was&nbsp;sending warning signals to my brain.</p><p>That wasn’t allowed. That was something that shouldn’t be allowed to exist above ground.</p><p>Of course, it was a hallucination. Once I blinked again and gazed&nbsp;at the top of the hill once more, the angel-like girl had returned.</p><p>“All forces……”</p><p>However, my instincts were screaming. The intuition that I’ve polished for 50 years was shouting with all it had. That it was dangerous, that remaining here for even one more second was tremendously dangerous. Following the intuition of mine that has saved my life countless of times, I opened my mouth.</p><p><strong>“All forces…… retreat! This is a trap!”</strong></p><p>And at the same time.</p><p>Thousands of arrows rained down from above the hill.</p><p>Screams resonated from all sides. Blood splattered. The once silent march of departure had instantly become a living hell. Left and right, the enemy troops that were split in half were firing their crossbows without end. Our troops, who had left behind their weapons, could not even consider the option of resisting and were slaughtered like livestock.</p><p>“Escape! All forces, do not fall&nbsp;to your knees. Do everything you can to run away!”</p><p>Despite having shouted&nbsp;as if I was vomiting&nbsp;blood, my&nbsp;soldiers did not respond. They were merely swept up&nbsp;by the panic, and were running about in confusion. There were even soldiers who had lowered their heads to the ground and began trembling.</p><p>“Your lordship. You have to escape!”</p><p>My adjutant shouted.</p><p>“This place is dangerous! Please consider&nbsp;the future!”</p><p>“But the soldiers—”</p><p>“We do not consider men&nbsp;who are unable to take care of their own lives as a part of the free company. Hey! Take his lordship margrave and retreat quickly! If our lord gets even a single scratch, then I will personally shove a nail in your ass!”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The cavalry came to my side, but I did not move. I was the commander. I could not run away while leaving behind my soldiers. Even if they were not a citizen militia but hired soldiers instead, it was still the same.</p><p>“Pardon my rudeness.”</p><p>My adjutant extended his leg. He then&nbsp;stabbed the heel of his shoe&nbsp;into the thigh of my warhorse. My warhorse,&nbsp;having been jabbed by a sharp heel, let out a loud neigh and started to run at full speed.</p><p>“Adjutant!”</p><p>“The Goddesses shall protect Rosenberg!”</p><p>In mere moments, I had crossed over the hill and escaped from the battlefield. I turned back for the final time and saw my adjutant doing whatever he could to get the soldiers in order.</p><p>An arrow came flying from somewhere and pierced my adjutant’s head. He fell from his horse. My adjutant’s&nbsp;facial expression, and the sight of him falling to the ground, I was not able to see any of it. The infantry were completely covering the area around him. My adjutant’s corpse fell into the center of remnant troops…… like being swallowed into an ocean……</p><p>“—Kuuuuuh!”</p><p>The taste&nbsp;of blood spread in&nbsp;my mouth. Unbeknownst to me, I had bit my tongue. Wrath&nbsp;travelled&nbsp;through my veins and raged on. The inside of my head became so hot that my skull felt numb. I glared at the hill.</p><p>“I will kill you……!”</p><p>It was certain that that girl was the enemy forces’ commander. That greeting, the greeting that appeared so modest, was nothing more than a signal to commence fire. That girl was the pawn of Demon Lord Dantalian. The main culprit to bestow onto me disgrace. And my, Rosenberg’s, enemy!</p><p>“I will not forgive you! Swearing on the River of Styx, I will not forgive you until the day you die! Putting the name and honor of Rosenberg on the line, putting my blood and bone on the line, I will absolutely kill you!”</p><p>Mock&nbsp;this&nbsp;as the shouts&nbsp;from a defeated bastard. That was fine.</p><p>As a pledge of oath, I spoke the maxim passed down for generations in my family.</p><p>“The North shall not send this vengeance into oblivion!”</p><p>I shall devote the remainder of my little remaining life to get revenge on that girl. Demon Lord Dantalian. You as well, I shall cut off your head and place it on the Goddess’ altar. And then, once I’ve achieved all of my vengeance, is when I shall close my eyes……</p>"

Lord, is it fine to not pursue him?”</p><p>“Leave him be. That man is Margrave von Rosenberg. A high noble who’s contending for precedency in the northern region of the Habsburg empire. If I were to capture&nbsp;the margrave here, then the consequences would become needlessly big.”</p><p>I declared.</p><p>There was no reason for us to distinguish ourselves more than necessary yet.</p><p>‘The rank 71st rice fish Demon Lord had suddenly captured&nbsp;the greatest margrave in the empire.’, this would become an excessively large scandal. Instantly gaining the attention of the entire continent. Factions earnestly vigilant towards me will&nbsp;appear as well. This was something I did not wish for.</p><p>The Earl&nbsp;of Rosenberg’s territory was located on the border area between the human and demon world.</p><p>In order for the demon armies to invade the humans, and the human armies to invade the demons, this was the path that both sides had to cross over first. If we were to thoughtlessly touch this danger zone, then we would be waking up a sleeping wolf.</p><p>Staying low was the right choice here.</p><p>“Although we may have won here, if you looked at it objectively, this is&nbsp;not an impressive victory. This was nothing more than 3,000 soldiers suppressing a mere 1,000. Adding to that, I have lost my Demon Lord Castle as well. If anything, the other demons will most likely ridicule&nbsp;me.”</p><p>A Demon Lord who had lost his Demon Lord Castle despite having&nbsp;an overwhelming advantage in troops by 3 times the amount.</p><p>I planned to make that into how people evaluated me.</p><p>In conclusion, while I was a&nbsp;parvenu who had luckily sold the black herb in order to become this prosperous, I was also disregarded as the fool among fools who had accepted a half-breed outcast as my lover. If this wasn’t a perfect disguise tactic, then I didn’t know what it was.</p><p>I laughed with satisfaction.</p><p>“That margrave has done quite the outstanding job. To think he would blow up my Demon Lord Castle…… I was hoping that he would at least&nbsp;pillage the herbs from my castle, but he had gone and done something beyond that&nbsp;instead. How splendid.”</p><p>“No matter how big the world is, the only Demon Lord who would be happy that their Demon Lord Castle was destroyed is your lordship.”</p><p>Miss Farnese spoke in a dumbfounded tone.</p><p>“Although this young lady thinks that the other Demon Lords will look down on your lordship completely.”</p><p>“I can only be grateful if they do belittle me.”</p><p>That was exactly what I wanted.</p><p>“Think about it, De Farnese. Margrave von Rosenberg could have easily mobilized a force of 10,000 soldiers. However, the actual amount of troops he had brought with him was merely 1,000. A military force consisting mainly of light infantry and cavalry, at that. How much could he have been underestimating me to have done this?”</p><p>But it was thanks to that, I was able to survive.</p><p>If the margrave had led&nbsp;a massive army of ten thousand soldiers to invade&nbsp;my castle, then I would have been helpless to defend myself.</p><p>Even if I was overflowing with money, it still required time to draft&nbsp;troops. It would require several months&nbsp;before we could gather enough troops to even come close to 10,000. If we were unfortunate, then we would have had to recruit troops for 6 months while staying on our toes.</p><p>Regardless, Margrave von Rosenberg had stopped mobilizing troops at one thousand. An escape route was created there. The margrave’s carelessness had allowed me to preserve my life.</p><p>“It is a rule that&nbsp;even lions put their all into hunting rabbits. That margrave did not know of this simple truth, which&nbsp;lead to&nbsp;his own demise.”</p><p>“To put your all into hunting a rabbit, is it……? That&nbsp;is quite the&nbsp;profound line. This young lady shall keep it in mind.”</p><p>“How commendable. As a reward I shall press your crown.”</p><p>“Ah—, ackackack—, but we won— We achieved victory like your lordship wanted, but why is this young lady&nbsp;being kneaded agaaaaain……?”</p><p>Give up. From now on, this little lady was my personal rice cake. I had taken a liking to this unbearably squishy feeling of her head. I shall dote on you as much as I did my second half little sister.</p><p>After the battle was over, we had captured a considerable amount of prisoners. Around 600 of the 1,000 enemy troops had lost their will to fight and surrendered. Since it was both myself and Miss Farnese’s first time dealing with post war matters, we were perplexed.</p><p>“Does your lordship have a facility to accommodate prisoners?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“What do you expect from a Demon Lord who&nbsp;just had&nbsp;their Demon Lord Castle destroyed?”</p><p>“Mm. Since it would be troubling to let them go like this, let us just get rid of them.”</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders. I had no reason to refuse.</p><p>600 humans were dealt with on the&nbsp;hill that day.</p><p>While looking down at the sight of the slaughter happening before us, we shared&nbsp;a friendly conversation(is what it’s called, but read as kneading&nbsp;punishment). The prisoners wailed and pleaded for us to spare them,&nbsp;but we ignored it.</p><p>“Ah, now that I think about it.”</p><p>I remembered something important.</p><p>“De Farnese. You have not committed murder with your own two hands before, have you?”</p><p>“Mm? If you were to go into details then yes, your lordship is correct.”</p><p>“I recommend using this opportunity to experience the act of killing. The difference between killing someone in your head and actually killing someone is considerably vast. If you were to gain the experience beforehand, then you will not end up in a delicate situation later on.”</p><p>“Indeed. That makes sense.”</p><p>Laura De Farnese nodded her head and proceeded to go down the hill. She received a long sword from one of our soldiers and immediately swung it at a prisoner’s neck in one smooth motion. Because the neck wasn’t severed in a single&nbsp;hit, she had to swing the blade 5 to 6 times.</p><p>With the prisoner’s head in her left hand, Miss Farnese trudged her way back to where I was. She looked at me and tilted her head.</p><p>“This young lady didn’t really feel any noteworthy emotion?”</p><p>“Hou. It seems you have a stronger heart than I imagined.”</p><p>In my case, I was quite shaken up after my first kill.</p><p>I could still distinctly remember my shaking hands from having killed my two kidnappers. I was in my 3rd&nbsp;year of elementary school at the time.</p><p>Although, in truth, the person to have incited that kidnapping was one of my father’s concubines.</p><p>At the time, one of my&nbsp;kidnappers had screamed in terror, ‘I did nothing wrong! Your family said they’d pay me. Please forgive me!’</p><p>Perhaps I was more shocked by that statement than I was at&nbsp;my&nbsp;murders.</p><p>People blinded by love were bound to do something crazy.</p><p>My father had closed his eyes eternally unaware of the truth of this&nbsp;incident. I had purposely stayed silent on my side. It felt like I would be&nbsp;a snitch if I told him, so it was not to my liking. That was my view back then.</p><p>I did not want to borrow the hand of my father.</p><p>I would personally punish the one who threatened my life.</p><p>Since the lion does not ask the tiger to fight in their stead.</p><p>At the age of 10, was the moment my own fundamental sense of ethics was engraved into my brain.</p><p>“Lord. This young lady&nbsp;wishes to make this prisoner’s head into a skull and keep it.”</p><p>Miss Farnese hugged the head and spoke.</p><p>“For one reason or another, this is the first person this young lady has ever killed. It is a monumental event. Due to your lordship, this young lady was&nbsp;able to discover that making&nbsp;history on one’s own is much more enjoyable than keeping watch on the history of the past. Thus, this fellow’s head shall be the first sacrifice to carve this young lady’s name into history…… I desire to cherish it preciously.”</p><p>“Well, is it not&nbsp;fine? A hobby of collecting skulls is rather sophisticated so it is&nbsp;remarkable.”</p><p>“Mm, this young lady knew your lordship would understand.”</p><p>It was not like I understood her exactly.</p><p>I was respecting her.</p><p>After Laura De Farnese had given the order to clean up the postwar outcome—I had passed this task onto her because it was extremely tiresome to do myself—I went to look for Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>Lala was organizing documents in the quarters at the rear end of our forces. Once I entered the room, Lala stopped what she was doing and stared at me.</p><p>“……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>The moment I was about to open my mouth, she took the initiative.</p><p>“This one is disappointed.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“—This one was disappointed.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli put down the stack of paper.</p><p>And glared straight at me.</p><p>“Your highness had treated this one like a common lover.&nbsp;What this one desired from your highness was to be treated as a companion of authority, never did this one desire for a lovers relationship chained down to one another. Why did&nbsp;your highness carelessly try to steal this one’s game and prey?”</p><p>“……I am sorry.”</p><p>“Yesterday, did your highness say that your highness loved this one?”</p><p>I nodded my head.</p><p>“Does your highness still love this one?”</p><p>“Surprisingly, it seems so.”</p><p>“……Haa.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli let out a small sigh.</p><p>“Let us establish rules.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“By rules, you mean?”</p><p>“Do not ask for affection from this one, and this one as well, will not yearn&nbsp;for affection from your highness. The most important thing to your highness and this one is taking hold of power in the demon world. In order to achieve that, a cold attitude that is capable of going through blood and tears is necessary.”</p><p>“I agree completely.”</p><p>“…… Things have become a mess.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli pressed her fingers on her forehead and closed her eyes.</p><p>“Love is nothing more than a weakness. The excess baggage of emotion that serves no purpose. For your highness to truly consider this one as a woman is&nbsp;a surprise. Before this one is a woman, this one is a mere peasant succubus&nbsp;who&nbsp;wishes to secure success.”</p><p>“Lala. I have something to say regarding this matter as well.”</p><p>I smiled faintly.</p><p>“I am not the only one with excess baggage attached to their emotions. Lala. You do as well. It is regrettable, but you are not in the position to be so confidently reproaching me.”</p><p>“This one apologizes, but this one is unable to understand what your highness is talking about.”</p><p>“Are you not in love with me as well?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli slowly&nbsp;knit&nbsp;her brows.</p><p>“Is your highness sane? There is a limit to overinflated egos.”</p><p>“Think carefully. If I were to fall into being a slave to&nbsp;love, if anything, it would be beneficial&nbsp;for you. If I were to be bound, made to submit, and forced to kneel by each and every one of your words, then eventually, you will take a position more superior to Demon Lord Dantalian. Thus,&nbsp;on the day that I obtain the seat of power, you, having already placed me into your hand, would be the true greatest authority, would you not?”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli shut her mouth.</p><p>The smile on the edge of my mouth grew wider.</p><p>“But you did not do so. No, you were unable to even entertain that notion. Instead of feeling delighted at the sight of myself obsessing over you, you felt displeasure. Why do you think that was so?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>A long period of time passed.</p><p>A certain shock was contained within Lapis Lazuli’s blue eyes. As if she was witnessing an overwhelming natural landscape for the first time.</p><p>“……Your highness is right. This one had no reason to refuse your highness’ courtship. Why would this one……”</p><p>“That is because you love me.”</p><p>I took a step towards her.</p><p>Our gaze grew closer by that much as well.</p><p>“However, before loving someone else, we love authority more. Therefore, we love the person who also loves the same authority as ourselves. Like how a musician would be attracted to their lover who appreciated&nbsp;music. Like how a poet would be attracted to their lover who was infatuated by poems……”</p><p>Exactly the same as themselves.</p><p>Towards the person&nbsp;who strongly yearned for authority as much as themselves.</p><p>Towards the person who understood as much as they did on what authority was.</p><p>Us being drawn together was inevitable.</p><p>“Lala. I love the you, who loves authority.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Your cold tenacity, your merciless pragmatism, and your attitude that does not allow even the slightest bit of carelessness and tolerance. I love them all. However, at the moment you lose your pure aspiration towards your lust for power, I will love you no longer.”</p><p>“……This one understands.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli’s eyes slowly became thin.</p><p>“The sight of your highness regarding something other than authority as precious, this one had felt disappointment towards that. Because this one had perceived that the part of your highness that this one loves was waning.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli closed her eyes.</p><p>Slowly, as if she was trying to appreciate something.</p><p>“So this is……&nbsp;<strong>my love</strong>.”</p><p>“That is so.”</p><p>Another step.</p><p>“We are the same. The two of us both&nbsp;love authority the most. Therefore, when we see the other person disregard power, an&nbsp;uncontainable rage stirs inside of us.”</p><p>“What your highness has said is correct. Authority has the prime value. Nothing can be said against this.”</p><p>Lapis opened her eyes.</p><p>Lala’s usual cold gaze was there.</p><p>“Although this one does admit that she loves your highness, this one has to apologize. In the end, your highness is not more precious than authority.”</p><p><strong>We are the same.</strong></p><p>A step closer.</p><p>Perhaps it wasn’t appropriate to refer to this emotion as love.</p><p>It was not love.</p><p>It was not friendship.</p><p>The same kin.</p><p>The feeling of ascertaining&nbsp;the fact that a person perfectly akin to myself existed in this world.</p><p>Not like Laura De Farnese, who had only recently stood up on her own, but two people&nbsp;who have&nbsp;already discovered themselves&nbsp;and&nbsp;were&nbsp;completely developed. These two met and recognized who the other person was, and confirmed their&nbsp;kin.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Up until&nbsp;now,&nbsp;I was a unique race in my own world.</p><p>Only I existed, and I alone formed another&nbsp;type of humanoid race distant from other Homo sapiens.</p><p>But now, I had met Lapis Lazuli and discovered the second of my kind.</p><p>In other words,</p><p><strong>Love for humanity.</strong></p><p>We were currently perceiving&nbsp;a love for humanity that consisted of solely us two.</p><p>“Do you know what is the best part about being a Demon Lord? It is the fact that I&nbsp;barely have to sleep. There was a time that I had stayed up for four nights in a row agonizing over something. At the time, I very much disliked the idea of falling asleep and having my worries be cut off mid-way.”</p><p>Taking the final step closer towards her.</p><p>We had finally reached one another.</p><p>“Normal people would say that dreams are pointless. That among the things in one’s life, something like dreams was not needed. However, I’m a bit different. Dreams not only made my life&nbsp;feel useless, but it made it powerless as well. I have&nbsp;always been swept up in this&nbsp;emotion.”</p><p>“Even though it may only be by half, this one is still a succubus.”</p><p>Without anyone having to take the initiative.</p><p>She and I slowly drew our bodies together.</p><p>While I wrapped my arm around her back, she moved&nbsp;her own arm around me as well.</p><p>Like two venomous snakes coiling around each other.</p><p>“This one can control your highness’ dreams.”</p><p>“You shall make me perfect.”</p><p>“Yes. This one shall make your highness perfect. And this one as well, shall become perfect through your highness.”</p><p>Our faces grew closer.</p><p>Our breaths too, grew closer.</p><p>“You are&nbsp;<strong>my weakness</strong>. However, if we pay enough&nbsp;attention, if we do not forget what race we are originally from, then not a relationship where we reveal each other’s flaws, but a relationship where we cover each other’s shortcomings instead.”</p><p>Solely for a more mighty authority.</p><p>Solely for a more greater authority.</p><p>Thus, not a fiancée, but—</p><p>A partner.</p><p>The two of us were partners.</p><p>“Lapis Lazuli. I love you.”</p><p>“This one too, loves your highness. Lord Dantalian.”</p><p>Our lips met.</p><p>A virtuous sound effect&nbsp;rang in my ear.</p><p>Ο</p><p><strong>[You’ve sincerely reached a communion with the other party!]</strong></p><p><strong>[Lapis Lazuli’s affection went up by 50!]</strong></p><p>Ο</p><p>Instead of paying attention towards something like a&nbsp;notice window, I pushed further into Lala’s touch.</p><p>Her cool yet soft skin was pleasant.</p><p>Ο</p><p>A bit deeper.</p><p>Ο</p><p>While exploring each other’s warmth, while confirming each other’s existence.</p><p>I to myself, and her to herself, each person&nbsp;simply filled each other.</p><p>Like a dog chasing its shadow.</p><p>Avariciously.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/dunde2-304.jpg?w=700\"></p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 9, Day 21</p><p>Niflheim, Governor’s Palace</p><p>“Barbatos. This morning you came here and told me this. That the only significance love has is that it reveals your weakness. That people don’t grow stronger through love, but they grow stronger after throwing it away instead.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Your words are half right and half wrong. Certainly, Lapis was my weakness, and I too was Lapis’ weakness. But that is&nbsp;it. While the two of us share love, we do&nbsp;not make each other weak.”</p><p>On the contrary, it was the opposite.</p><p>“We only make the other stronger&nbsp;without bounds.”</p><p>Barbatos fell into a silence.</p><p>While enjoying my&nbsp;wine, I spoke.</p><p>“Our love may not be warm, but it is cold. We may not be soft, but we are sharp. Even though we may be unable to accept something, we are still going towards something. We are firm, so we do not break, and in perfect order, we annihilate the enemy before our eyes. That is our practice. And it is also the reason why we had returned to Niflheim after defeating the margrave’s army.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“The letter.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>Ο</p><p>“The culprit to have written that letter informing me of the invaders is none other than you, Barbatos.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>“……”</p><p>For an instant.</p><p>Barbatos’ face froze.</p><p>“Like I said, what are you talking……?”</p><p>“It was a simple test. The culprit always returns to the&nbsp;scene of the crime which they had succeeded in committing. I tried utilizing this old and antique saying once.”</p><p>With a soft gaze.</p><p>As if I was stroking her with my hand, I glanced at Barbatos from head to toe.</p><p>“Whoever it was that had sent me the letter, it was clear that the person held goodwill towards me. Since they did&nbsp;notify me of the fact&nbsp;that invaders were going to appear, after all. However, who could have&nbsp;known the detailed circumstances of Margrave Rosenberg, and had the capability of acquiring such information? Barbatos, how vast does one’s information network have to be in order to know the exact information of the dispatched troops? The culprit was without a doubt&nbsp;someone with great power.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>For example.</p><p>Someone powerful enough to be rank 8th.</p><p>Someone hostile towards the humans and thus constantly taking note of the military movement in the human side.</p><p>Someone who was well-informed of the situation in Earl Rosenberg’s territory, since it resides&nbsp;in the border area between demon and humankind.</p><p>“Yes. Barbatos. A person of authority such as&nbsp;yourself.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Barbatos opened her mouth.</p><p>At some point, she had regained her mischievous expression.</p><p>“……Aha, ahahaha. I was curious as to what you were trying&nbsp;to say.”</p><p>Her voice was composed as well.</p><p>“Dantalian. Of course, I’m quite the freaking awesome person, just as you said. An information network in the human race, well, obviously I have that. Since you never know when those humans are going to try and start some funny business.”</p><p>Barbatos grinned.</p><p>Her acting ability was quite splendid. As a politician, it was the&nbsp;ideal. It wasn’t a coincidence that she was the leader of such a large political faction known as&nbsp;the Plains Faction.</p><p>Her usual exaggerated actions that appeared frivolous, her mixing of profanities into her words that&nbsp;made the ears of others feel unpleasant, and her wearing clothes with so much exposure that it made others troubled on where to put their eyes.&nbsp;<strong>These were all calculated actions.</strong></p><p>A means to lure and manipulate another person’s mind as she pleased.</p><p>“But that’s all, you know? I’m not the type of person to write&nbsp;something trivial like a message. If something happens, then like right now, I’d spit it right in your face in person. Why would I send a letter like some narrow-minded fool?”</p><p>She had approached me as if she truly cared about my well-being, despite being a person who had absolutely no interest in my love life.</p><p>She acted as if she was sincerely listening to my story.</p><p>Therefore, I had said earlier.</p><p>That Barbatos was a&nbsp;<strong>good woman</strong>.</p><p>I have rarely ever seen a woman as politically thorough as this.</p><p>Barbatos was able to develop her acting&nbsp;ability through the extensive 500 years of her life. Certainly, it was a tremendous ability. Aah, it was at the level that would make even the greatest of actors cry. Although it wasn’t on my level, I acknowledged that it was right below my chin.</p><p>Original talent won over effort.</p><p>My aptitude for acting could only overwhelm your efforts.</p><p>“In the first place, if I did send you that letter, then there’s no reason for me to be denying it like this. Don’t you think so? In the end, you were saved thanks to that note.”</p><p>Barbatos shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>“Without that letter, you wouldn’t have known the margrave’s army was invading and would have just got done in. Therefore, the person who wrote that letter is your savior. Why would I throw away the free opportunity to put you in my debt? That’s because I really didn’t send it.”</p><p>Although it was plausible.</p><p>It was a shallow excuse.</p><p>“Barbatos. That’s because you didn’t send that letter with the intention of saving me.”</p><p>“Hey, fuck. I keep saying I didn’t send it, but you’re still&nbsp;saying that?”</p><p>“You wrote that letter with the intention to simply ‘test’ me.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Barbatos had said to me.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— I was hoping that an actual useful rookie had appeared after such a long time, but isn’t he&nbsp;just a complete mental patient?&nbsp;Haaa, my fate is always like this…….</p><p>— How the hell do I make this retard&nbsp;function like&nbsp;an actual person…….</p><p>Ο</p><p>How could she have known that I was&nbsp;<strong>a useful rookie</strong>?</p><p>Was it simply because I was able to make money off&nbsp;of the black herbs?</p><p>Barbatos did not know the inner details of what exactly I had done to become wealthy. Was it merely thanks to luck, or was it because I had gotten Ivar Lodbrok in the palm of my hand? Luck and skill, which side was the source of my success was uncertain to her.</p><p>Thus.</p><p>By the time&nbsp;Barbatos had brought up those words, she had already tested me using a certain method beforehand.</p><p>“After hearing the news that the margrave’s army was moving, Barbatos, you most likely wanted to see my ability once.&nbsp;You wanted to see with your own eyes if I truly was a useful personnel. You sent the letter, and then patiently waited to see how I responded to the invaders….….”</p><p>The result was a pass.</p><p>Demon Lord Dantalian had safely passed the test called Margrave von Rosenberg.</p><p>Now Demon Lord Barbatos had decided&nbsp;that she would recruit Demon Lord Dantalian into her faction.</p><p>Except, there was a large problem placed there.</p><p>“Do you perhaps remember?&nbsp;The words you uttered the moment you came here yesterday.”</p><p>“….….No. Since I’m not the type of person to particularly remember something useless.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Then remember it now. For this was not&nbsp;an unimportant occasion for you, not by a long shot. From the very beginning you had abruptly said to me this.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>—&nbsp;If you’re trying to break up with that&nbsp;succubus lover of yours, then I can help.</p><p>—&nbsp;In the first place, it doesn’t make sense for an outcast to be having sex with a Demon Lord. It’s not too late yet, so ask for my help.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Speaking frankly, this was a severely meddlesome thing to say.</p><p>But if you changed your view slightly, then this was an exceedingly obvious advice.</p><p>Because if the personnel she planned to scout to her faction was ‘a fool who had taken an outcast as their lover’, a great damage would be inflicted on the image of Barbatos’ faction.</p><p>Image management was a core part of politics.</p><p>In Barbatos’ position, there was a need to lead me into breaking up with Lapis no matter what.</p><p>“……Haa. I gave&nbsp;you that advice while being purely considerate of&nbsp;you.”</p><p>After hearing my words, Barbatos grimaced.</p><p>“You’re really a bastard who treats favors like shit, huh? What? Does everyone appear like coyotes aiming only for political gains in those eye sockets of yours? Your way of thinking is really terrible, Dantalian.”</p><div></div><p>“When you heard the news that Demon Lord Dantalian was slapped in the&nbsp;plaza by Lapis.”</p><p>I spoke in a low tone.</p><p>Barbatos sealed her lips.</p><p>“At the time you probably thought this. That a golden opportunity had arrived. You quickly approached me with the intention of striking while the iron was hot. Within 20 minutes after I was slapped, at that.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>—&nbsp;Go ahead and let it all out. Why&nbsp;did you two fight?</p><p>—&nbsp;Do you not see me applying ice&nbsp;still? It has&nbsp;only been 20 minutes since I was slapped by Lapis.</p><p>Ο</p><p>“Here in Niflheim, I am famous for my passionate love for Lapis.&nbsp;In your position, the headache this must have caused you must have been immense. For starters, you had to make them break up, but how you were going to accomplish in&nbsp;separating them, didn’t come to you.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“At the report that I was slapped, you thought that ‘this is it’. There’s&nbsp;no weaker glass than someone&nbsp;who was just in an argument with their lover, and moments after they had went their separate ways. It would shatter if you tapped it with a hammer. You most likely assumed&nbsp;that if you played your cards right, then you could tear the relationship between Lapis and I with ease.”</p><p>Then Barbatos was cautious.</p><p>In order to not let her true intentions be obvious.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—&nbsp;Did you say your lover’s name was Lapis Lazuli? Damn she’s admirable. How the hell was she able to deal with you? If it were me, I’d have cut your balls off and ran away a long time ago.</p><p>Ο</p><p>This was the part where Barbatos was commendable.</p><p>She did not take my side, but on the contrary, had taken Lapis’ side instead.</p><p>As if to plant the misunderstanding that ‘breaking up on her account’ was the right choice.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— You two really should just break up.</p><p>Ο</p><p>She had adroitly disguised her words.</p><p>Initially, Barbatos must have been pleased that everything was flowing passively. Once Barbatos had heard that I tried to kill Lapis’ mother, she was certain.</p><p>This is finished.</p><p>Barbatos was convinced&nbsp;that a person who could tolerate a man who had tried to kill their own mother and continue their lover relationship, did not exist.</p><p>However, as her stratagem was progressing smoothly—she was faced with a problem that she had never expected.</p><p>“The instant&nbsp;you started to panic, Barbatos. Was the moment I confessed for the second time my love for Lapis. It must have been incredibly preposterous. I understand. You most likely never imagined there would be a person in the world whose love was as insane as mine.</p><p>“……”</p><p>“You had tried to convince me quite verbosely.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>—How is that love?</p><p>—That’s, not love.</p><p>—It’s fine if you two break up, but love…… is an emotion that’s more precious than anything else. It is something that other things should yield willingly to, to make way for.</p><p>Ο</p><p>“The emotion that I feel now is not love. Love is something more noble than anything else. More sacred. It is something that is softer…… By claiming so, you wanted me to point to my own emotion and say that ‘this is not love’, right?”</p><p>I smiled gently.</p><p>“I’m sorry that you were unable to achieve your aim, Barbatos. This is my payment for being my love counsellor throughout the night. I shall specially prove that this is another example of love.”</p><p><em>Jingle</em></p><p>I raised a small bell and shook it.</p><p>Once I did so, the door to the reception room opened and someone entered. Barbatos was startled and turned to look towards the door. There, Lapis was standing with an&nbsp;emotionless expression on her face.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Did your highness call?”</p><p>“Aah. You went through a lot of trouble standing in wait all night, Lapis.”</p><p>“It is fine. Thanks to your highness, this one has become accustomed to staying up all night.”</p><p>At the sight of us two conversing, Barbatos looked at us&nbsp;with a perplexed complexion.</p><p>“What is this……?”</p><p>“Lapis. It seems her highness Barbatos is a bit doubtful of our love. It appears she thinks that you hold a grudge against me for having tried to kill your birth mother. What do you think? Would you care to show it to her highness Barbatos as well?”</p><p>“Understood. This one shall present it immediately.”</p><p>Lapis bowed and left the reception room. Barbatos looked at me with eyes that looked as if she couldn’t understand. Well, wait a little. Lapis’ pace is unexpectedly fast so she will return momentarily.</p><p>A peculiar silence passed. Shortly after, Lapis returned. In her hands, she&nbsp;was carrying a silver platter that the maids used to deliver food.</p><p>“Now then, Lapis. Show it to her highness Barbatos.”</p><p>“Yes. Excuse this one.”</p><p>Lapis delicately&nbsp;lifted the lid off of the tray.</p><p>“……”</p><p>Barbatos’ eyes became wide.</p><p>While beaming, I clapped my hands.</p><p>“How is it? Is it not splendid? This is Lapis Lazuli. This is my first love,&nbsp;my mistress&nbsp;who may perhaps be my only love. Barbatos. Behold.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>On top of the shining silver platter was a person’s head.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>face of the old woman</strong>&nbsp;who came here half a month ago.</p><p>Ο</p><p>“That is Lapis’ birth mother.”</p><p>“…………What?”</p><p>“Do you still not understand? She was murdered. By Lapis herself!”</p><p>I burst out in laughter.</p><p>The sound of laughter filled the reception room. Though this was quite the discourteous thing to do&nbsp;in the middle of the night, it was unavoidable. How&nbsp;am I to stop when laughter came from my chest all on its own?</p><p>“Lapis was not enraged because I had tried to kill her mother. She was upset because I had carelessly tried to step forward while forgetting my place!”</p><p>Barbatos’ complexion was still bewildered.</p><p>“What…… are you saying?”</p><p>“I’m talking about revenge, Barbatos. Revenge! Is it not obvious that one&nbsp;must obtain&nbsp;vengeance with their own two hands against the person who had ruined their life? Despite that,&nbsp;since I had tried to do as I pleased and achieve revenge in her stead, of course Lapis would be mad!”</p><p>Ο</p><p>—Why did&nbsp;your highness carelessly try to steal this one’s game and prey?</p><p>Ο</p><p>The line&nbsp;Lapis had said to me.</p><p>The words she had said while&nbsp;reprimanding me had that meaning.</p><p>Unable to contain my own laughter, I chuckled. It was a completely unseemly laugh. However, I wasn’t overflowing with the&nbsp;breadth of mind to be concerned with&nbsp;my dignity here. I wanted to enjoy this moment to the fullest.</p><p>“You understand now, right? On the 9th month and 3rd day, the day that old woman&nbsp;came to my reception room, Lapis had immediately chased after her&nbsp;and assassinated the old hag&nbsp;in secret. Aah, how lovely this girl&nbsp;is! How&nbsp;adamantly this girl&nbsp;had executed an equation of revenge! Lapis, I truly love you……”</p><p>“……Her highness Barbatos is watching. Please have some dignity, Lord Dantalian.”</p><p>“What of it? It becomes better the more love one shares.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli let out a small sigh.</p><p>Now even that sigh was lovely. Truly, I really am the apostle of love. Even Goddess Aphrodite would look down at me and smile contentedly. To point at me and criticize that ‘I did not know love’, there was a limit to obstinately false propaganda.</p><p>“It’s not only the old woman. Lapis had even assassinated the maid that had insulted her. To my surprise, I found out later on that the incident was covered up as an accident. They said food got caught in her throat and she choked to death, but in truth it was poison. It is fine to marvel, Barbatos. Since our Lapis is truly a remarkable woman.”</p><p>“This certainly is indeed a problem, seeing that your highness’ drivel has gone beyond control. This one shall take her leave.”</p><p>“Ah, sure. Go and get some rest. Since we will not be sharing a bed tonight, you do not have to go out of your way to apply rose oil before you sleep—.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>After giving me a cold gaze, Lapis left the reception room.</p><p>Yes. I was self-aware of the fact that I was behaving fairly foolishly. But this was my first love. It was obvious that I would be unable to come to my senses and was&nbsp;infatuated with a girl. This was perfectly normal.&nbsp;I turned my head to gaze at Barbatos.</p><p>“I told her that if I were to be slapped in a plaza, while&nbsp;in front of&nbsp;many people, then the culprit to have sent the letter will come find me. And once I did, without a single bit of hesitation, she slapped me. Then we acted as if we had broken up.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Lapis Lazuli was that kind of woman.</p><p>The partner that&nbsp;I loved was that kind of woman.</p><p>“—And so, Barbatos.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“How was it? Oh maestro of love, who has had over 1,000 lovers over a course of 500 years. Oh Barbatos, who had said that if I listened&nbsp;to your love advice then beautiful women would give me fellatio even if I was just laying down. What is your impression on the new category of love which you have witnessed for the first time in 500 years?”</p><p>Barbatos went silent.</p><p>With her head bent downwards, her shoulders trembled.</p><p>And then.</p><p>“…………Ha.”</p><p>Her shoulders shook a bit more violently.</p><p>“Ha……haha, hahah……ahaha–&nbsp;Hahahaha–……Heu, gehehe—eheuh, Keuhehe–&nbsp;Haa, heu, ha—haha,&nbsp;<strong>KAHAH! KUHAHAHA! HAHA, AHAHAHAHA—!”</strong></p><p>What started as uncontrollable laughter had reached uncontrollable laughter of madness.</p><p>Barbatos shook her entire body as she laughed.</p><p>The laughter continued on for a long while. Barbatos snapped her head back up. A clear insanity flowed on her face. The rims of her eyes and the corners of her mouth were twisted in gleeful derision, and her white teeth shined with voracious greed.</p><p>“A masterpiece!&nbsp;<strong>This is, a masterpiece!”</strong></p><p>This.</p><p>This was the rank 8th.</p><p>The highest ranking necromancer praised for&nbsp;her immortality, this was Demon Lord Barbatos’ naked face.</p><p>“Aaang? Heung, euung? Dantalian, you were able to present me joy that went beyond my expectations. I’ve taken a liking in you. I’ve really, tremendously taken a liking in you. If perhaps, your goal was to bargain for my goodwill then I will congratulate you. Mm. Since I have certainly become fond of you.”</p><p>“I’m glad that you’re delighted.”</p><p>I shrugged my shoulders.</p><p>“As the actor who had provided you with this&nbsp;performance throughout the night, it is rewarding.”</p><p>“Performance? Puh, puhahaha. That was a performance? That was a stage that you calculated from start to finish? This retarded fuck. Are you saying that you did all kinds of shit just to incite&nbsp;laughter from me!?”</p><p>“You are Barbatos. The rank 8th Demon Lord. If it took only a single&nbsp;night to touch your sincerity, then I consider this a cheap price.”</p><p>If there was another object that I had invested on for this night, then it was the Year 1101 Balleleunium wine.</p><p>I had purposely acquired the finest quality wine in order to incite even the smallest bit of carelessness in Barbatos. In order to enjoy this most sublime wine, Barbatos had thoughtlessly&nbsp;allowed herself to get drunk. She had disabled the alcohol detoxification inside of her, on her own. The result was this comedy happening before me.</p><p>“Kakakaka! Yeah, it’s certainly a cheap price. You really do know your place. My inner thoughts that I’ve&nbsp;never revealed to anyone for 300 years, you were able to obtain within a single night, after all. But that’s&nbsp;foolish. Aah, there’s no doubt that it’s foolish.”</p><p>Barbatos grinned.</p><p>Her smile was so wide that it felt like the corners of her mouth would rip.</p><p>“I can’t overlook someone who’s figured out what kind of bitch I am, you know? Makes me nervous. If you spread a rumor like—I looked into it and found out that Barbatos is actually a bitch who raises internal organs and venomous snakes. Hm? The negative impact I’d receive won’t be small.”</p><p>“Most likely.”</p><p>“Now then, Dantalian. Quickly turn that smart head of yours. How should I deal with the bastard who has witnessed my naked face? My compatriots of the demon world only think of me as someone who’s pure and righteous, you know? In order to not disappoint those kids, I have the duty to rip your mouth out. Think well before I cut your tongue off, little Demon Lord……”</p><p>Barbatos slowly approached me.</p><p>A black mist billowed around her.</p><p>A mist formed by magical energy. The discerning eye to know what kind of magical effect that mist had was absent to me. Except, even I could tell that it wasn’t something good for my health.</p><p>“No, cutting off your tongue would be a waste. Your eloquence and voice would certainly be useful in demagoguery operations. Should I make you into my puppet? Would that be more efficient? For starters, should I kill you by slitting your throat, and then revive you into a slave that listens and obeys my commands alone?”</p><p>Barbatos chuckled.</p><p>“That would be fun. Ah, while I’m at it, should I also make your succubus lover into a slave as well? I may despise succubi the most in the world, but in one way or another, I’ve taken a liking to you both. I’ll organize an arena where you two can kill and die to one another. But of course……”</p><p>Barbatos gripped my chin and raised it slightly.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Her golden eyes were exceptionally close.</p><p>“The story would be different if you pledge your loyalty to me.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“I am a generous Demon Lord, Dantalian. I protect the&nbsp;people who come into my faction no matter what and until the very end. Albeit there may be a slight condition, that isn’t very important.</p><p>“……I’m rather curious as to what that condition is.”</p><p>“Hm.&nbsp;<strong>Not being able to leave the faction until you die.</strong>”</p><p>Barbatos smiled smoothly.</p><p>The insanity which was flowing on her face a second ago was nowhere in sight now.</p><p>But it wasn’t surprising.&nbsp;You did not determine how psychotic a person was by how quickly they revealed their madness, but rather, you determined it&nbsp;by how swiftly they hid their lunacy.</p><p>“Although, you actually won’t be able to leave even after death. Since I’m the greatest necromancer in the continent. If I put in a little effort then I could revive your corpse. That’s why, for all of eternity— you will join my faction and work until your bones are dust.”</p><p>“May I ask what your goal for labor is?”</p><p>“What a trivial question. Obviously, it was already decided on&nbsp;<strong>the extermination of humankind.</strong>”</p><p>A bitter laugh unintentionally slipped out from me because of the very Demon Lord-like response.</p><p>Still smiling comfortably like a Marian, Barbatos spoke.</p><p>“The demon world is too barren. Not only is agriculture barely possible, there is a limit to feeding all of our people while relying solely on commerce. Just the mere fact that those inferior humans are occupying that abundant agriculture belt fills me with rage.”</p><p>“Conquering the continent. Is that your goal, Barbatos?”</p><p>“No. My goal is providing the demonkind with a bountiful life. Dantalian, I may be a warrior, but before that, I am a single empress.”</p><p>Barbatos bit my right ear.</p><p>With a ‘crunch’, the feeling of my bones in my ear breaking transferred to me.</p><p>I felt the pain but I endured it. The liquid flowing down from my ear was probably blood.</p><p>“That Paimon bitch is declaring for coexistence with the humans, but honestly, that’s not possible. Look. Different from&nbsp;us, humans all look alike. Despite that, they are split apart by nations or whatever and are hostile towards each other. For our demonkind, who varies&nbsp;in appearance, language, and customs, to get along with the humans? That’s superb nonsense.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“But us demons are different. Demons can come together as one under Demon Lords. It is possible for a countless number of races to&nbsp;cohere into a single group.”</p><p>“And therefore. That’s why we’re the&nbsp;sacred and inviolable representatives that symbolize absolute dignity, and members of an order of 72 who rule over all demons……”</p><p>“Exactly. Well done, our little&nbsp;Dantalian.”</p><p>While grinning, Barbatos pulled my ear.</p><p>She stubbornly pulled at the part where the flesh was torn and the bones were breaking.</p><p>“Since humans don’t accept the divinity of Demon Lords, there is no other choice but to exterminate them completely. That’s why those guys are like the foreign substance of our&nbsp;world. For the utopia of everyone becoming one and living peacefully, we have to wipe them out.”</p><p>“That is quite the extreme logic.”</p><p>“Logic is always extreme. The ignorant masses are&nbsp;terrified of that extremity and live under a vague but warm self-comfort. To them, the truth is like a cold snowy wind, so if they are hit by it on&nbsp;their bare skin, they will freeze and die. Therefore,&nbsp;they cover themselves with rags layered with hypocrisy and deception. Believing that those rags are clothes. But unaware that, in truth, that was their skin.”</p><p>“That is an impressive philosophy.”</p><p>“I’d be glad if you referred to it as an incredibly accurate&nbsp;philosophy.”</p><p>Barbatos stopped harassing my ear.</p><p>Her fingers were covered in crimson blood. She brought them to her lips. And her saliva and my blood were mixed on her finger.</p><p>“Hm. Your blood is considerably sweet. I see your eating habits are clean.”</p><p>“I personally think that eating nothing when possible&nbsp;is the correct eating habit.”</p><p>“That’s a good way of thinking. And it’s also correct. That’s much better than those swines that shove their noses into whatever they can. You were slightly like a swine, Dantalian. I’ll use this opportunity to tell you.”</p><p>Barbatos whispered.</p><p>“Do not carelessly mess with Demons Lords above the rank of 10.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“You seem rather confident that you were able to crush that bitch Paimon, but make some air holes in your lungs. Despite her looks, she’s not an easy bitch. As if she didn’t appear like a whore already, she goes around opening her legs here and there, sheesh. If you make a wrong move towards her, then her lovers from all over…… it’ll be troublesome. Incredibly annoying.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Barbatos clicked her tongue.</p><p>“You were just lucky. They let it slide that time since it was&nbsp;<strong>so clear</strong>&nbsp;that Paimon was in the wrong during the Walpurgis Night. I don’t know what’ll happen if a bunch of scary uncles approach you, you know?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“I’ll offer this to you for the final time. Come into my faction, Dantalian. With your resources, you could contribute to the prosperity of all demons on the continent. Even if your personality is rotten to the core, that doesn’t mean you’re unable to work for a righteous cause. Don’t worry. I’ll even look over that succubus lover of yours. Although you’ll have to quash your engagement. Even I’m capable of being lenient if you decide to keep her as your concubine in secret……”</p><p>“I shall gift you war.”</p><p>Barbatos shut her mouth.</p><p>She furrowed her brows.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You’re most likely hoping for war, Barbatos. A massive war is required&nbsp;in order to destroy humanity. The present, where the Black Death is running rampant, the military forces of the humans are continuing to decrease. You should have judged that if you wished to accomplish the unification of the continent, then now was the golden opportunity.”</p><p>“……Hmm.”</p><p>As if&nbsp;I had peaked her interest, Barbatos smiled slyly like a cat.</p><p>“And if your assumption is true. Then what?”</p><p>“I do not assume. I merely see through.”</p><p>That was the difference between a theorist and a politician.</p><p>“The war that you desire. I shall bring it upon us.”</p><p>“Kakaka. What’s this rank 71st rookie saying?”</p><p>Barbatos laughed mockingly.</p><p>“Do you know what scale of war that I want? A war of extermination. A war to exterminate an entire race. A massive war where all the Demon Lords take part in, along with all the nations of the human world. It’s not something small a loach like you could offer.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>“The war that I will gift you is exactly&nbsp;that.”</p><p>“Haa? How would someone like you start a massive war……”</p><p>“Spread the rumor that the Demon Lords have spread the Black Death.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>A stillness fell on the reception room.</p><p>Barbatos let out a dubious voice.</p><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><p>“If you think about it, then it’s simple. The Black Death is currently sweeping over the entire continent. The regions that were successful in suppressing the initial spread is no more than a precious few, since the humans are less informed on plagues than us demons.”</p><p>A portion of cities were fortunate&nbsp;in preventing the spread of the plague.</p><p>It was thanks to the fact that&nbsp;I had discovered the black herb several years earlier&nbsp;than&nbsp;it was supposed to found. Some lords had utilized both their territory’s assets and family fortune to buy the black herbs en masse, and used those to protect their people.</p><p>However, the amount of lords who have done this&nbsp;were few.</p><p>The majority had used the expensive black herb only&nbsp;to protect themselves and their family. There were even people who bought the black herbs from me and distributed it for an exorbitant price. In conclusion, as the Black Death had done in &lt;Dungeon Attack&gt;, it was causing a countless number of lives to be lost.</p><p>The humans.</p><p>The peasants especially were experiencing hell.</p><p>“Human society&nbsp;is slowly breaking down. The lords and temples that are unable to handle this accordingly. The dissatisfaction towards the nations and royal families are at the highest point in history—in this situation , if the rumor that ‘the Demon Lords caused the plague’ were to spread, then how do you think the monarchs in the human world would utilize this?”</p><p>“……!”</p><p>Barbatos’ eyes grew wide.</p><p>Indeed, she was a smart woman.</p><p>She had soon grasped the intention that I was trying to convey to her.</p><p>“They will actively make use of this rumor. The people in the wrong are not the lords, the nations, or the royal families. They will zealously elucidate to the people that, the true axis of evil are&nbsp;the Demon Lords who had initially spread this atrocious epidemic.”</p><p>“Don’t tell me……!”</p><p>“We will inversely make use of that usage.”</p><p>By obtaining the merchant named Lapis Lazuli, I had gained wealth.</p><p>By obtaining the general named Laura De Farnese, I had gained military strength.</p><p>The only thing which I required now was a just and great cause.</p><p>A justification.</p><p>A name.</p><p>My name.</p><p>“The lords in the human world will spread the rumor in order to extinguish the immediate flame, but they will do so while being&nbsp;unaware of&nbsp;how much terrifying force the Black Death will actually exhibit. As time passes, the humans will curse us Demon Lords. Despise us. Obviously, the voices demanding for the military forces to rise and suppress the Demon Lords will rise exponentially. And without fail, the point where the lords in the human world are unable to control the overheated public opinion will arrive. The entire human race will cry out for war and vengeance, and the lords will only be able to conform to them.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The name of the Demon Lords.</p><p>“Blow the horns of Pruteni. Sound the whistles of Livonia. Beat the drums of&nbsp;Jötunheimr and make the entire continent tremble. Make the song of Selonian, Ratgallian, and Semigallian reign as the prominence&nbsp;of fear.&nbsp;<strong>A&nbsp;devastating&nbsp;war</strong>, Barbatos.&nbsp;<strong>If we can’t invade&nbsp;them, then we just have to make them invade&nbsp;us</strong>.”</p><p>I shall spread the name of Dantalian across the continent.</p><p>I delightfully watched Barbatos’ facial expression slowly solidify.</p><p>Smile&nbsp;more energetically. Is this not the entertaining part? I rather liked it when I smiled. It was surely the best when people lived smiling during the times they wanted to.</p><p>The occasion of myself becoming your vassal will never happen.

      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><h4><strong>Prologue</strong></h4><p>Ο</p><p>The saying that life is&nbsp;a gamble was credible.</p><p>A person was good at war if they handled people like they did wagers. If people’s lives were not treated as stakes, then&nbsp;a war where hundreds and thousands of lives were cut down would become hell. Barbatos stated that people cannot&nbsp;cross this living hell while sober.</p><p>“Above a diligent bastard is an insensitive bastard, and above an insensitive bastard is an insane bastard. That’s why, if you want to win at war then you need to first become a crazy bastard.”</p><p>There was a mixture of laughter in Barbatos’ words.</p><p>The laughter and cruelty on her face were indistinguishable. I could not tell if she was behaving like that in order to show me her amusement, or if it was because she wanted to broadcast her brutality to me. Although, personally, it felt like that indistinguishability was Barbatos’ own madness.</p><p>I had sex with Barbatos frequently. Despite that, we did not share our feelings. I understood her deeply, but I was unable to&nbsp;fathom the very bottom. Barbatos was merely a diligent bitch, an insensitive bitch, and an insane bitch. And even to Barbatos, I was merely a lazy bastard, a keen&nbsp;bastard, and a psychotic bastard. Our preferences in bed matched. Since an insane bitch and a psychotic bastard had met, then they should be able to get along fine for the moment.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—Please spare us.</p><p>—If not this humble one, then at least this one’s daughter.</p><p>—I will work as a hound for the rest of my life, so please forgive me.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Even to the group of humans captured as prisoners before us, Barbatos smiled. She had prepared for war since before the start of autumn.&nbsp;Since people&nbsp;were wagers&nbsp;in war, Barbatos had many reasons to be cruel. Only the prisoners did not know of the upcoming war. To them, Barbatos’ smile only shone as unprovoked violence.</p><p>“Do whatever you guys want. Why are you asking me about your life and death? If you’re going to live then live, if you’re going to die then die.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>I nodded. The language spoken&nbsp;by the humans and the language spoken&nbsp;by Barbatos were different, so I had to stand as an intermediate to interpret. The only person proficient at the human language while also being a Demon Lord was myself.</p><p>“She says to die obediently.”</p><p>The prisoners all lowered their heads to the ground at once.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—Because we are foolish, it is difficult to understand.</p><p>—Please decide what we must do.</p><p>Ο</p><p>“Oi, would you look at that?”</p><p>Barbatos snickered. The demon soldiers around her&nbsp;laughed as well.</p><p>“Dantalian. What are they babbling&nbsp;about?”</p><p>“They said your words are too damn vague, and want you to break it down for them so they can understand easier.”</p><p>“Iyaa, what an abundance of bullshit. If they live then that’s their life, and if they croak then that’s their death.&nbsp;Why should I care?”</p><p>I nodded my head.</p><p>I then translated her words exactly to the prisoners.</p><p>“This lady here said that you&nbsp;guys are quite full of&nbsp;shit.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>—Oh lord, forgive us!</p><p>—Please&nbsp;spare us from your anger!</p><p>Ο</p><p>The prisoners sobbed&nbsp;and the&nbsp;demons laughed once more. The weeping from the&nbsp;humans settled down low and fluttered, while the sound of laughter from the demons echoed upwards and dispersed. The sound of sobbing and laughter was boisterous, causing&nbsp;the pronunciation of words to be&nbsp;difficult&nbsp;and tremble. Words were enveloped by laughter and eaten away by laughter. Since it was difficult to handle the words on my own, I did what I could as it came and improvised.</p><p>If Barbatos asked.</p><p>“Is the provisioning situation in the empire decent?”</p><p>I would translate it as.</p><p>“She asked what you guys ate&nbsp;on average&nbsp;for all of your mugs to look so dirty like bums.”</p><p>And to the question.</p><p>“I heard that in your neighborhood the crown prince and the 3rd imperial princess are having a big fight over who’ll be the next emperor. Does their lively confrontation have any effect on you citizens?”</p><div></div><p>I translated it as.</p><p>“They say the crown prince, after having scored two of his little sisters and then killing them off, is now trying to score his third little sister. What do you all think about this?”</p><p>Despite that, there were no problems in regard to communication.</p><p>It wasn’t a joke.</p><p>In the first place, Barbatos was planning to execute all of the prisoners anyway. She was merely poking at the captives here and there half as a jest.&nbsp;It would be more honest to tell them to hastily prepare for their demise than providing them a false hope.</p><p>If you completely got rid of the laughter and sobbing that was like grime attached to the words.</p><p>Ο</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>—Die.</p><p>—We wish to live.</p><p>—Die anyway.</p><p>—We wish to live anyway.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Would&nbsp;remain cleanly.</p><p>It’s so simple.</p><p>Occasionally, while pretending to be interpreting, I would throw completely random questions.</p><p>“What is your name?”</p><p>“Do you have any last words you&nbsp;wish&nbsp;to leave behind?”</p><p>“Prepare yourselves for death.”</p><p>Then, the peasants, having realized their approaching&nbsp;demise, wept.</p><p>Shortly after, Barbatos grew bored&nbsp;and&nbsp;severed the lives of the prisoners. The decapitated heads fell to the floor and rolled in separate directions. All of the heads had their mouths hanging agape with&nbsp;a certain word still lingering on their lips.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—……</p><p>—……</p><p>Ο</p><p>I stared at the wide open mouths. It was simply dark. I was unable to&nbsp;see the bottom past the throat.</p><p>Past the tongue, a path to hell lay in wait…… was the thought that crossed my mind.</p><p>Barbatos had said that in order to go to war while avoiding the path to hell, one must treat the lives of others like a wager. However, be it Demon Lords, emperors, demons, or humans, everyone lived their lives while having swallowed hell down past their tongues. &nbsp;The important matter wasn’t avoiding hell or not…… was another thought that came to mind. The only&nbsp;thing that mattered was that, if there were people who threw up hell from their mouths, then there were people who held hell within their stomachs and endured it.</p><p>“Dantalian. Has the amount of humans we’ve killed reached roughly over a thousand now?”</p><p>“Who knows. Since this is the 22nd fire-fallow cultivating village we’ve burnt, it should be around there.”</p><p>Barbatos looked up into empty space.</p><p>She muttered.</p><p>“Then we’re still lacking…… Let’s burn a bit more. If we hold back in our slaughter&nbsp;here, then many of us will die instead.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><hr><p>TL note: Thanks for waiting guys. It actually took me much longer to read volume 3 than I expected. The author almost completely changed their writing style to the point that some parts were difficult to read unless I read it multiple times. HENCE MEANING. Translating volume 3 is going to take much longer than volume 1 and 2. Cheers.</p><p>Oh, and I guess I should do the same thing as I did in volume 2 and give you guys a heads up. The same thing that happened in volume 2 isn’t going to happen again, so you guys don’t have to worry about being at your wit’s end to figure things out. Nor do you guys have to save up the entire volume before you start reading. It’s honestly fine to read one chapter at a time. So I guess you should wait for an entire chapter release before reading. Since I’ll probably still be doing parts.</p><p>Also, as a side note, my personal review of volume 3 is actually pretty amazing. Probably better than volume 2 and maybe even 1. There’s actually a lot of dark moments in this volume, so people who are uncomfortable with madness, violent scenes, and a lot of inner monologues, might not find as much joy as I did in this volume. The way the author changed their writing style was actually supposed to display Dantalian’s descent into madness. So bear that in mind.</p>"

      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><h3>Volume 3 – Chapter 1 – Wordless Sounds<strong></strong></h3><p>Ο</p><p>—Let’s burn a bit more.</p><p>Ο</p><p>The words spoken in a light tone by Barbatos climbed over the  mountain ranges and set villages ablaze. Since the start of autumn,  we’ve spent our time burning ravines and setting the feet of mountains  aflame. Although it appeared as if the flames were burning on their own,  it wasn’t a coincidence that the areas we set ablaze always had a  fire-fallow cultivating village located there. Many people were burnt to  death.</p><p>We asked each other in a nonchalant tone.</p><p>“How many people have you killed today?”</p><p>“I wonder. I think I’ve burned around 30.”</p><p>“This kid. You’re still completely wet behind the ears, aren’t you? I’ve burned 70 people today alone.”</p><p>“Sure. Good for you.”</p><p>That was our way of greeting one another.</p><p>At first, the nobles in the humans’ society did not take any actions  whether the fire-fallow villagers died or not. These village people were  of the lowest class. Once autumn passed and winter approached, and the  amount of slash-and-burn villages we’ve burned to the ground reached  over 30, was when the human army began to move at last.</p><p>The human scouts were slow. We released the witches’ familiars and  used them to observe the human forces. Surprisingly, the human troops  were not moving in order to rescue the peasants. Anything that tried to  avoid the inferno and escaped down the mountain, be it peasant or  goblin, the human army hunted them down indiscriminately.</p><p>If we burned one side of the mountain range, then the imperial  soldiers were dispatched, if we burned the other side of the mountain  range, the soldiers from the kingdom were dispatched. Armies started to  slowly move around more frequently. The soldiers were pushing their way  through the smoke to find the culprits who had burned down the  fire-fallow villages. However, the only thing remaining was the black  smoke which warmly welcomed the scouts with open arms. I wonder if that  desolation felt awkward, the scouts needlessly sliced the noses off the  corpses of villagers and goblins before departing. Noseless corpses were  scattered around on the ground.</p><p>“What’s this?”</p><p>Barbatos smirked.</p><p>“What the hell are those guys trying to pull?”</p><p>“They’re trying to set things back to as if nothing has happened.”</p><p>“Set things back? What are they trying to set back?”</p><p>“Restore something that can’t be restored. It can’t be helped since  the forest fire has already happened, but if they get rid of all the  witnesses to have seen the forest fire, then that’ll be the same as the  fire not having happened in the first place.”</p><p>“It wasn’t even the peasants or the goblins who started the fire, but why are they shifting the responsibility to them?”</p><p>“By making them take the responsibility, the soldiers avoid the blame.”</p><p>“But what’ll happen if the peasants inform the king?”</p><p>“That’s why they’re killing them all.”</p><p>……In the humans’ society, peasants are not considered as citizens so  they don’t have the right to accuse someone of a crime to the king……this  was something I didn’t go out of my way to tell her. The class system  among demons was similarly strict. Myself, who was in a relationship  with an outcast was weird, and Barbatos who was in a relationship with  that weird me, was also weird.</p><p>Barbatos groaned.</p><p>“They’re incomprehensible people. And since they’re incomprehensible, they can’t be associated with. Are all humans like that?”</p><p>“The majority are born like that.”</p><p>The cloud of smoke rising from the ashes and flames enveloped the mountain range.</p><p>One day, Barbatos ordered a witch to kill one of the scouts. The  witch, after having murdered the soldier, brought back his report.  Barbatos furrowed her brows. The report was not written in a cryptogram  but in plain texts.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—The fire-fallow villagers are starting fires while fighting against  the goblins. The villagers are setting ablaze the goblin habitats, and  the goblins are doing the same to the peasant villages. There is a lot  of smoke. It is difficult to breathe. The mountain range is burning.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 12, Day 6</p><p> Niflheim, Governor’s Palace</p></h4><p>The diligent movement of the human armies appeared suspicious in the  eyes of the demons. A rumor spread in the demon world. It was a rumor  mixed with doubt.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Seems those guys intend to cross over the mountains and invade us.</p><p>— They’re claiming that us demons were the ones to have spread the  Black Death, so I’m worried that they’ll use that as a reason to gather a  large army.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ο</p><p>On the streets, people could not tell the difference between suspicion and certainty.</p><p>A groundless rumor that the humans made the Black Death on purpose,  with the intent to kill us, circulated. There were people who objected  by saying, ‘What a bunch of bull. We’re not Gods, so how could people  possibly create a plague?’ and disregarded it as a false rumor. But,  although the humans may not have created the Black Death, they  still firmly believed that us demons had produced it anyway. Thus, there  was some truth in the saying that we had to be cautious from now on. In  any case, the humans needed a subject of criticism. They could reproach  their neighbors but that would be pointless. They could resent the Gods  but that would be hopeless. The humans bit down on the easiest thing to  criticize, the easiest to blame, and the easiest to resent; the  demonkind. Since their monarch, their emperors, and their nobles  wouldn’t want to be chewed out, they passed on all of their  responsibilities to the demons. Regardless, no one could respond when  asked what they were going to do about it.</p><p>It’s something the Demon Lords will decide, not us low-class people……  That was the majority opinion. In the vacant area with no answers,  people gathered every day and repeated the same words. I sent out spies  and controlled the dynamics of the rumors.</p><p>Once the groundless rumors and the false rumors mixed together, the  contents of the words were no longer important, the volume was.</p><p>‘Since long ago, humans have always been a race of unsociable  barbarians, so we should exterminate them before they try to mess with  us’, these words resonated the loudest and above all.</p><p>The voices overflowed from the center of the plaza to the streets of  the markets, and to the alleyways. Until eventually, the voices flooded  into the palace of the Demon Lords.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—Kill all of the humans!</p><p>Ο</p><p>Shouts burst out in the conference room.</p><p>The Demon Lords were gathered in the governor’s palace of Niflheim  and were shouting respectively. The low-ranking Demon Lords clamored  loudly, while the high-ranking Demon Lords remained silent. It seemed  like the higher ranking Demon Lords were waiting for the voices to  naturally rise up from the bottom.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— It’s winter now, so how do you expect us to raise an army?</p><p>— It may be difficult for us in the winter, but it’ll be more  difficult for those weak humans. That’s why winter is the best time for  us to invade. It’s even better since the rivers will be frozen, so  there’ll be nothing to block our path.</p><p>— Our soldiers will all freeze to death before they can get across the mountains.</p><p>— Our warriors are courageous, so they won’t fall to something like winter wind!</p><p>— That’s right!</p><p>— Would you look at that? It appears that amongst the Plains Faction,  it’s a trend to learn how to bark like a dog before learning how to  think first.</p><p>— I’m not really sure about that. But I do know how to beat an ill-mannered son of a bitch like a dog.</p><p>— Be quiet over there.</p><p>Ο</p><p>There was no logic in the voices yet. If we were to go to war, then  when and where would we do it? If we were to not go to war, then for  what reason would we not do so? What will we do about the provisions?  What will we do about the military funds……?</p><p>The voices were obscured as if they were buried under smoke. Only  after the low ranking Demon Lords argued for a long period of time,  would then the voices stack up piece by piece until they  eventually formed a tower, like taking the shape of a 5 w’s and 1 h  structure, and finally making the words coherent after doing so. The  leaders of each faction seemed to wish to argue while on the peaks of  those towers, where the smoke was clear.<em> (TL note: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws\">Five w’s and one h</a>)</em></p><p>Ο</p><p>— We gathered here to chat, did we not? Or are we gathered here to  keep our mouths shut? Once they’ve run out of things to jabber about,  they’ll remain quiet even if they want to keep rambling.</p><p>— Even if our soldiers are able to endure the winter cold by relying  on their willpower, what are you going to do about obtaining provisions?   Even if we acquire provisions by commandeering and pillaging, then how  do you plan to deal with the plague? You all may be brave, but you’re  merely overflowing with excessive words and stand out as reckless  instead.</p><p>— What are you talking about? Say it easier so we can understand.</p><p>— If there are people who are able to understand difficult words,  then there are people who are unable to comprehend even the easiest of  words. This is not an issue on my side, but a dilemma with your  intelligence. If I were to speak a bit more fundamentally, then your  personality is a problem as well.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>— Now I’m able to understand a bit.</p><p>— You two over there, please quiet down.</p><p>— You told us to ramble a second ago, but now you’re telling us to be  quiet? I don’t get it. This guy is really prattling as he pleases.</p><p>— You got that right. Or perhaps, maybe he’s telling us to shut up so  he can ramble on his own? What a bad person. Hey, despite how I look,  I’m still rank 12. Zepar, what’s your rank? Are you higher than me?</p><p>— My mistake. Your point is correct. I am not certain about the  others, but there is a need for Sitri and Beleth to be silent. If both  the rock head of the Mountain Faction and the rock head of the Plains  Faction are to clamor at the same time, then things become hectic. At  this rate, everyone will have a headache.</p><p>— Did that guy just say that I was dumb?</p><p>— It’s a relief that you were able to understand that since I didn’t mean anything else besides that.</p><p>— What are you all talking about right now?</p><p>— It’s none of your business.</p><p>Ο</p><p>The meeting continued throughout the whole night.</p><p>Since the majority opinion seldom came together, the words converged  like smoke for a moment before dispersing back out. The fumes that  Barbatos and I had raised since autumn had traveled past the mountains,  disrupted the borders and were now gathered in this conference hall of  Demon Lords. Their vision was clouded. The summit could not be seen.  There were no signs of their words being able to penetrate the fog. The  high-ranking Demon Lords stayed silently seated for more than 6 hours.</p><p>“That’s enough.”</p><p>The leader of the Mountain Faction, Demon Lord Paimon, opened her mouth.</p><p>“Please stop. Everyone, do you not feel dizzy? This lady feels  light-headed. Since no one is turning their ears to the words of others,  conversations are unable to be shared, since conversations are  unable to be shared, they do not gather, and since they do not gather  they are unable to flow, and thus becomes blocked. Where is this place?  It is suffocating.”</p><p>The meeting room became still.</p><p>The Demon Lords, who were exchanging curses up till now, shut their  mouths before the rank 9th Paimon. Instead of having no words to say, it  seems they were just apprehensive to give a response.</p><p>Previously, Paimon had tried to accuse me of a crime in this location  and was met with a disastrous defeat. Although Paimon’s reputation may  have fallen due to that incident, she was still in command of the  highest amount of Demon Lords. People referred to Paimon and her  remnants as the Mountain Faction.</p><p>The Demon Lords that belonged to the Mountain Faction had built their  castles in the deepest part of the mountains to prevent humans from  approaching them with ease. This resulted in their name, ‘Mountain  Faction’. A location that was difficult to be approached by the human  forces, was also an area that was difficult to leave for the demon  armies. It was peaceful. Naturally, since it was problematic to go both  in and out, there were few struggles. The Demon Lords from the Mountain  Faction were reluctant to go to war against the human armies. To them,  cowardice was their deliberation, thus a massive war was forthwith a  vice. According to Paimon and her remnants, they were protecting the  peace of demonkind.</p><p>However, in consonance with Socrates’ hypothesis, the name Mountain  Faction originated from something completely different. It was called  Mountain Faction because Paimon’s chest was as lofty as the mountains.  Paimon, along with her massive mountains, protected the Demon Lords, and  the Demon Lords submitted to her maternal instinct. Socrates referred  to Paimon and her remnants as the Big Breast Faction.</p><p>Bonjour—.</p><p>Paimon spoke.</p><p>“What proof is there that the human army is going to invade our land?”</p><p>Ο</p><p>—……</p><p>Ο</p><p>“I see. There is no evidence. If there is no proof that their side is  going to attack our side, then for what reason do we have to assault  them from our side first?”</p><p>Ο</p><p>—……</p><p>Ο</p><p>“Everyone. Our people are fatigued by the plague. Instead of  searching for justifications that do not exist, we should supply our  profits which are lacking and solidify our domestic affairs.”</p><p>“Wow—. Hey, hey, would you look at the way that thoughtless bitch is talking?”</p><p>The leader of the Plains Faction, Barbatos, spoke.</p><p>Barbatos and the group of her followers resided in Demon Lord Castles  built on extensive plains. The humans and demons fought endlessly  for the fertile land. Before people could grow tired of the everlasting  battle, a new generation was born and inherited the battle anew. War  repeated. Different to people who are able to pass the battle on to  their descendants, a new generation for the land to pass on the raging  battle did not exist. The land remained in place and continued to  receive the constant traces of battle. For hundreds of years, the ground  repeated the process of receiving scars and healing itself. After 300  years, the land no longer had the fertility to bear even a single grain  of wheat or an ear of barley. The ground had met its fate, and yet the  war continued. Barbatos and her gang, who persisted this  utterly unfounded battle, were referred to as the Plains Faction.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The Demon Lords in the Plains Faction were trying to find something  in a land that had nothing left. Like how beggars would embellish  poverty as honesty and priests would claim weakness was kindness, the  Demon Lords changed ‘having no reason to fight’, to ‘not needing a  reason to fight in the first place’. To them, war itself was sacred.  Since we don’t have anything, we need to have something, was their  logic. Were they not a bunch of people with loose screws in their heads?</p><p>However, according to Karl Marx’s theory, the name Plains Faction  emerged from something entirely unrelated. It was called Plains Faction  because Barbatos’ chest was as spacious as the great plains. Like an  open field, Barbatos accepted the Demon Lords, and the Demon Lords were  touched by how commodious she was. Karl Marx referred to Barbatos and  her gang as the Flat Chest Faction.</p><p>C’est si bon—</p><p>“Oh, look at these village folks. Are you all planning to quietly  watch as this bitch says shit like that? Seeing as her mug is annoying,  that means there’s no thought in her words, and seeing that there’s no  thought in her words, then that means there’s no brain in her head, and  seeing that there’s no brain in her head, then that makes her plain shit  ascend to bullshit and run wild. If you don’t stop that bitch now, then  she’s the type of whore to become self-conceited about heaven and earth  and go completely insane on all sides.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Paimon let out a deep sigh.</p><p>She had an expression on her face that said she was expecting this.</p><p>Lowering her gaze that was looking up at the ceiling, Paimon spoke.</p><p>“How pitiable. If this lady’s face is annoying then that would  represent the lack of intelligence in your head, and if this lady’s  words are thoughtless then would that not represent how your life has no  answers? Since living a life with no answer is pathetic, why not commit  suicide right now? ……Oh dear. This lady apologizes. If you were to  commit suicide then that would mean you’d have come to  the realization that your life indeed has no answers, but there’s no  intelligence in Barbatos’ head, right? This lady forgot for a moment.”</p><p>I wanted to stand up and give them a round of applause.</p><p>Indeed, they were Barbatos and Paimon.</p><p>It was worthwhile to have withstood my boredom for a good 6 hours and repetitively play porn inside of my head.</p><p>I’ve lived until now solely to witness these two argue. They knew how  to swear beautifully. In accordance to Barbatos’ flat chest, her vulgar  language was spread out roughly, and in consonance to Paimon’s ample  bosom, her curses were curved indirectly. Neither side were normal  breasts. That was so. They weren’t normal breasts……</p><p>……</p><p>Was that not right?</p><p>Was it their ability that was abnormal and not their breasts?</p><p>Or did something like that not matter?</p><p>Everything in front of me felt like it was slightly spinning. It was  strange. If you exclude earlier today, where I got along with Miss  Farnese while smoking together, I did nothing else throughout the day.  And that was also something I enjoyed for a very brief moment of time  before coming to the conference hall.</p><p>Well, there were days like this occasionally.</p><p>Adieu—.</p><p>Mademoiselle—.</p><p>“War is not negotiable.”</p><p>Paimon spoke.</p><p>“It is not a civil war where we quarrel and bite at each other, but a  massive war against the entire human race. Thousands of people will  lose their lives and hundreds of thousands of people will be injured.  Please weigh the mass of these numbers. These are not lives that can be  handled without a proper justification.”</p><p>“Heeh. So you’re saying that if we have a pretext, then war is possible?”</p><p>“That is something to decide when that time comes. This lady is  saying to present proof first. If this is not taken care of beforehand,  then discussing the outbreak of war now is premature.”</p><p>Barbatos smiled.</p><p>“The humans have been preparing for war since the start of autumn.”</p><p>“The evidence?”</p><p>“Regardless of the border, the humans have been wandering around the  Black Mountains. If they pass the mountain range then they’ll be in our  territory. The humans are planning to clear out the path before going on  a full-scale invasion.”</p><p>“What do you mean by, ‘clearing the path’……?”</p><p>“There are orc and goblin villages on the mountain range. The human  knights are burning down every single one of those villages. What do you  think the reason is? They’re most likely getting rid of all  the cumbersome obstacles that are on the mountains which they plan to  advance through.”</p><p>Barbatos spoke confidently.</p><p>It was a lie.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The culprits to have set the mountain range on fire were Barbatos and I.</p><p>The human troops only trailed after us while going through the smoke  clouds that we raised. They were simply clearing up the monster habitats  as they chased after us. Between autumn and winter, rural villages were  swept away and monster habitats were crushed. While pushing our way  through the smoke, we played a game of hide and seek with the human  troops. The other Demon Lords were unable to see the fumes rising from  the frontier of the mountain range. With a skillful lie, Barbatos was  pulling in the cloud of smoke, which the Demon Lords were unable to see,  into the conference room.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Oho, the Black Mountains are a strategic point among strategic points, after all.</p><p>— It’s quite troubling that the humans are occupying the entrance of the pathway to our land, on their side of the mountains.</p><p>— What weird fellows. What could they possibly gain from starting a fight with us?</p><p>— The humans being buffoons is nothing new. People who were fools the day before will still be fools the next day.</p><p>— But you’re foolish most of the times and occasionally clever,  though? I’m conflicted on whether you’re actually dim-witted or not. And  honestly, contemplating this just makes me think that you’re even more  of an idiot.</p><p>— That’s proof that I’m actually smart. Like how a black dot on a  white sheet of paper is still just a black dot, if someone is mostly  moronic and sometimes resourceful, then that just means they’re smart.  Therefore, I’m wise.</p><p>— What are you all talking about right now?</p><p>— It’s none of your business.</p><p>Ο</p><p>The Demon Lords stammered like a bunch of blind people.</p><p>“……”</p><p>Paimon glanced at Barbatos with a scrutinizing gaze. Her eyes were  sharp. They had the strength to not be disoriented by the smoke-like  voices and stare directly at the other party. Instead of receiving that  straight gaze, Barbatos let it flow to the side.</p><p>“It’s not only the villages on the mountains that were assaulted.  Dantalian here was attacked by the imperial soldiers of Habsburg and  lost his Demon Lord Castle.”</p><p>“Dantalian did……?”</p><p>Paimon raised her brows.</p><p>It appeared as if she had heard an unexpected name in an unexpected passage.</p><p>Paimon turned her gaze towards me. Even the Demon Lords, who were  clamoring like the blind a second ago, all turned to look at me at once.  I could feel many gazes on me through the dark conference room. They  were the eyes of beasts. If I were to fumble my response here, then  those eyes would turn into mouths and tear me apart.</p><p>“Dantalian, are Barbatos’ words true?”</p><p>“Yes. They are the undeniable truth. The army of Margrave von Rosenberg trampled my Demon Lord Castle.”</p><p>“When was this?”</p><p>“It was from the 9th month and 16th day to the 9th month and 17th day  of this year. Through the course of three battles, I lost two times  and barely won once. The margrave’s army used gunpowder to bury my  castle. Truthfully, since my Demon Lord Castle was destroyed, it  shouldn’t be considered a win even if I did obtain victory in the end……”</p><p>I smiled bitterly.</p><p>“What were their numbers?”</p><p>“At the least, 2000. At most, 3000. They were not conscript soldiers.  They were elites. After interrogating one of the prisoners, they  confessed that they were hired.”</p><p>“……Are there no mistakes?”</p><p>“I had used the hired soldiers here in Niflheim to fight back against  the margrave. There should be some soldiers nearby who have fought with  me on that day, so you can ask them personally. The words they say and  the words I have said will not differ.”</p><p>The conference room became perturbed. The human army had already been  dispatched once. The Demon Lords were startled by that fact.</p><p>“I asked the prisoners why they had invaded my castle, and they  disclosed everything. That according to the margrave, the demons had  spread the Black Death, and that the cure to the disease was stored in  large amounts in each Demon Lord Castle. That’s why, if humans like them  wished to survive, they had no other choice but to attack the Demon  Lords……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“This is all the truth. At first, I thought that I was the only one  to have been invaded. However, to my alarm, were the human armies not  constantly wandering the vicinity of the mountains? Nervous and  overwrought, I kept an eye on the human armies since the beginning of  autumn. Habsburg Imperial forces, troops from the Kingdom of Teuton,  soldiers from the Polish-Lithunian Kingdom…… The human forces  disregarded the border and set the mountains aflame. They may have come  to an agreement of some sort in secret. Going further than that, they  may even be in an alliance……”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The meeting room froze. The winter wind from outside the palace  seeped all the way into here. Someone, unable to endure the silence,  spat on the floor. Infected by that, a couple of the Demon Lords cleared  their throats. Their throats were crowded with phlegm.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Are the humans trying to start another war?</p><p>— The last massive war was 150 years ago, so it’s about time for another one.</p><p>— If it’s the smoke rising from the Black Mountains, then I often saw that as well.</p><p>— What? Why are you telling us this now?</p><p>— Forest fires happen often during the autumn, so I didn’t think too much of it.</p><p>— Try to live while actually thinking.</p><p>— I may live without much thought, but you live without a mother.  Since it’s the same that both you and I live our lives without a certain  something, just look over this.</p><p>— This goat’s asshole!?</p><p>Ο</p><p>These guys died to the humans because they deserved to die, huh.</p><p>In the original timeline, all of the Demon Lords would be subjugated  within the next 30 years. I wasn’t able to tell while in the position of  the humans while playing the game, but after seeing these Demon Lords  in person, I understood. These people wouldn’t do.</p><p>On the other side of the mountains, the humans were advancing their  society through feudalism and absolute monarchy, but these fellows  called Demon Lords were still doing antics similar to that of tribes.  Although the rank 14th and rank 9th were rambling as if they were on a  high horse, if you looked at it factually, this was a state of affairs  consisting of 72 tribes each led by the rank 1st to the rank 72nd Demon  Lords respectively. Demon Lords were only kings and queens by name, but  they were actually closer to being tribal leaders.</p><p>30 years.</p><p>A time limit of 30 years.</p><p>The countdown has begun. Before the countdown went too far in, there  was a need to crush the human influences. The lightning has already hit.  It was just that people have not heard the thunder yet.</p><p>“Everyone. Of course, I am merely a rank 71st youngster. Despite  that, even I am able to see with these eyes that our situation is dire……  We must prepare for war.  If we do not prepare, then we must at least  be alert. Is that not the right decision?”</p><p>Now then, obediently accept my appeal.</p><p>If left alone, then you will all perish. If you were all to  succumb, then the demon influence will weaken and I will fall into  danger as well. We are a group sharing a common destiny. Even you all  will most likely dislike meeting an untimely demise by the hero’s blade.  I will arrange a battlefield suitable for people with a Demon Lord  status. Do not worry and do not refuse……</p><p>“People who are prepared shall triumph, and people who are alert  shall not be defeated. I lost my castle because I was unprepared and  inattentive. Please, I request that you all do not commit the same  mistake as I have……”</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯King’s Mistress, Mixed Blood, Lapis Lazuli<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 12, Day 6</p><p> Niflheim, Governor’s Palace</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>People who are prepared shall triumph, and people who are alert shall  not be defeated, so please do not commit the same mistake as I have……</p><p>Ο</p><p>His highness’ appeal was well-arranged.</p><p>Although reasoning was set up by his words, he did not use that logic  to attack others. He mentioned his past experience of failure but did  not remain there. His words were fierce, and yet, his tone was gentle.  Therefore, it was beautiful.</p><p>The other Demon Lords nodded their heads. The Plains Faction approved  the idea of preparing for war, while the Mountain Faction agreed to the  notion of being alert.</p><p>She most likely had a sense of crisis once the atmosphere flowed more  towards the topic of war. The advocate of peace, Paimon, stood forward.</p><p>“Dantalian. This lady too feels great regret because your Demon Lord Castle was assaulted.”</p><p>The Demon Lords turned their ears towards the conversation between  these two. His highness Dantalian and Paimon had already clashed against  one another in the past. At that time, Paimon met a devastating defeat.  How was it going to end up this time? Was the kind of expectation that  was flowing through the room.</p><p>“However, it is difficult to resolve ourselves to go into a massive  war by turning the entire human race into our enemy, solely because you  alone were attacked. This lady shall assist in the reconstruction of  your castle, so……”</p><p>His highness smiled.</p><p>“Thank you very much, Miss Paimon. But I shall refuse. I do not feel  any particular regret by the loss of my Demon Lord Castle. In the small  chance that I did feel pity due to that incident, the occasion of myself  borrowing the hand of you, Miss Paimon, will never occur.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“What is that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“The reason Margrave Rosenberg had attacked me is very simple. He had  obtained the rumor from somewhere that an endless amount of black herbs  were piled up in my Demon Lord Castle. It seems the margrave firmly  believed that I was the culprit behind spreading the Black Death. ……Is  it not intriguing?”</p><p>The Demon Lords stirred.</p><p>The pretext that his highness had just revealed aligned with the  accusation that Paimon made towards his highness in the previous  Walpurgis Night. Demon Lord Paimon and Margrave Rosenberg shared the  same awareness…… this was most likely peculiar in no small measures to  be considered as a simple coincidence.</p><p>Perhaps Paimon circulated the wild rumor intentionally?</p><p>This sort of suspicion was sufficiently plausible.</p><p>“I am curious. Where could the margrave have possibly acquired such  information from? Ah, of course, I am not doubting you, Miss Paimon. We  are all kinsmen, after all. Something like a traitor who would sell out  their own kind, there are none in this conference room. Is that not so?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“The Margrave most likely has an independent information network  spread throughout the demon world. The Margrave came in contact with  this groundless rumor by chance through that, that is my assumption. Do  not worry. Miss Paimon, you do not have any direct responsibility. Yes,  direct responsibility……”</p><p>Paimon’s face became stiff.</p><p>It was a tactful change of subject.</p><p>Even if Paimon did not spread the rumor in the human world, it was  still the undeniable truth that she had circulated it in the demon  world. If the Margrave did obtain the wild rumor from the demons, then  the fault would go all the way back to Paimon who created the false  rumor in the first place. It could then be viewed as Paimon having  contributed in the destruction of his highness’ castle.</p><p>Speaking explicitly—Why should I receive help from the culprit who  brought down my castle, was the cynical undertone that his highness was  talking with. Paimon was at a loss for words. Towards that Paimon, his  highness was gazing at her with naive snake-like eyes.</p><p>“It is alright. That incident was nothing more than something which  arose completely due to the wicked greed from the humans…… To be  concerned with the right or wrong among one another would not be a  sensible thing to do here. No, it may be different on a normal occasion,  but our current situation is urgent. We cannot start an internal  conflict during this state of emergency where the human forces could  invade us at a moment’s notice.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>This was indeed, a skillful wordplay.</p><p>After his highness had defined our current situation as an emergency,  he suggested that if this was perhaps a normal occasion, then he would  have reproached Paimon. In order to dodge the blame here, Paimon could  only agree.</p><p> That is so. As much as our current situation is dire, there is no need  to start a needless internal conflict. She was most likely thinking  along these lines……</p><p>It was a checkmate.</p><p>If she wanted to disapprove of the war then she had to prove that our  current situation was a normal occasion. However, if she wanted to  avoid the blame, then she had to accept the state of emergency. Paimon  was placed in a double-bind dilemma.</p><p>Paimon bit her lips.</p><p>“……It is snowing outside.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“This palace is forlorn. Do your bones not feel cold?”</p><p>What was this sudden question? I could not comprehend the meaning or  the intention. His highness Dantalian tilted his head as well and asked  back.</p><p>“Should we order the maids to stoke up the fire?”</p><p>“It is already near midnight. Would there still be maids doing their shifts now?”</p><p>“That is an unnecessary concern. Would the attendants go to sleep while the lords are still awake?”</p><p>“I see. That is so, isn’t it?”</p><p>Paimon stared at his highness.</p><p>“We are lucky to be kings. Even if we were to stay up throughout the  night, there are plenty of servants to kindle our flame. If our armies  are dispatched now, then they will have to go through the winter  mountains and streams with their bare bodies. Although we have maids  devoted in taking care of our well-beings, who will light the bonfires  when our soldiers are cold?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“This lady estimated the wind on her path to this palace. This winter  is especially arid. The earth is frozen all the way to its inner layer  because of this icy weather and is difficult to dig through with spades.  It will most likely take half a day to merely embed pickets into the  soil and erect an encampment. While advancing through the winter fields,  our soldiers will tire out on their own and collapse. This lady is  immensely concerned that everyone’s vision is blocked by the palace  walls and are unable to reach the cold winter plains.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“……Miss Paimon.”</p><p>Surely.</p><p>That was a valid rebuttal.</p><p>To not oppose war itself, but to oppose the time of war. It also  displayed the worry for one’s subordinates as a Demon Lord, so it  appeared graceful as well.</p><p>“If we raise an army, then our forces will cross the mountains and  travel through forests. Trees to use as firewood will be abundant.  Therefore, our troops collapsing due to being unable to kindle a  campfire, is a needless worry.”</p><p>“Dantalian. The task of crossing the mountains and splitting the  firewood is all managed by our soldiers. Will our troops not be  miserable?”</p><p>“Then should I split the firewood myself and present it to the soldiers?”</p><p>His highness gave an unabashed laugh.</p><p>“You have many worries, Miss Paimon. Although I am not unaware of  your highness’ innate virtue of taking care of your subjects, when  handling military affairs, one requires not benevolence but austerity. A  sovereign’s anguish will be transmitted to the general, and the  general’s woe will be transmitted to the soldier. The entire country  will then advance with concern and retreat with concern, therefore, even  if one were to obtain victory once, it will not be proper, and if one  were to be defeated a single time, then they will be unable to recover.  Since when did us demons worry about a campfire while going to war?”</p><p>The shouts, ‘That’s right!’, erupted from here and there.</p><p>Although I personally considered Paimon’s reasoning to be logical……  the overall majority of Demon Lords did not. They did not pay any mind  to the minor things. It wasn’t only Demon Lords, but most demons  believed in this idealism as well.</p><p>His highness Dantalian was different. His highness utilized this  idealism. His highness utilized everything. He manipulated the things  people enjoyed, and exploited the things people despised. His highness  claimed that this attitude of taking the use of all things was called  being pragmatic. One day I asked, ‘If that is so, then where is  pragmatism useful?’. His highness gave an immediate response.</p><p>Authority.</p><p>Having authority itself was good, and the very fact of not having  authority was bad, so I did not question the basis any further. I was  convinced by that irrational remark. My mind and his highness’ mind were  alike.</p><p>“For the past 500 years, we’ve raised a massive army 7 times and  withdrawn 8 times. Each time our forces were pushed back, we withdrew  our territory as well. And now, we’ve been chased back behind the  mountains. If we are to be defeated this time as well, then we will have  to yield to them the inner portion of the mountain range. This lady  is anguished over the future of our kind.”</p><p>“That is correct. The worry which Miss Paimon has, I too, am  concerned for as well. Despite that, should we not aim for this current  situation where the humans’ vitality is on the decline due  to them suffering from the plague?”</p><p>“The disease is indiscriminately affecting both the humans and demons, so why……”</p><p>“I am still in possession of a large amount of the herbs which can  triumph over the disease. I would like to offer these for one tenth the  current market price as military supplies.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Please spread this information wide amongst the people. That to the  officers and men who apply for military service, be they from a high or  low class, they shall be provided the cure. I shall offer 10,000 black  herbs within the military. So everyone, please take the herbs and  distribute them freely.”</p><p>In truth, the meeting was concluded by that one statement.</p><p>His highness, rank 71st Dantalian, had offered an enormous amount of  military supplies. Demon Lords that were of a higher rank than his  highness had no other choice but to keep their heads down in order to  save face.</p><p>A slight amusement glided past the corners of his highness’ lips.</p><p>He was most likely certain of his own victory.</p><p>……That was a bit unfair.</p><p>Every time I witnessed that side of his highness Dantalian, that  thought crossed my mind. I recalled the connection his highness and I  shared before the meeting was held today.</p><p>Ο</p><p>♦</p><p>Ο</p><p>Just before the conference, his highness was smoking gaya.</p><p>Gaya is an item of personal preference similar to cigars. Since they  are both easier to be intoxicated by and have no addictive properties  compared to cigars, they are incredibly expensive. The asking price is  extensive. His highness favored this elegant luxury item.</p><p>His highness did not enjoy this on his own, but he dragged Miss Laura  De Farnese along as well and ruined their lives together. Today as  well, once I entered the bedroom I witnessed the two of them behaving  like a pair of worms squirming around on the floor.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>It was a grand spectacle.</p><p>It felt like a group of drug-addicted hoodlums would show more moderation than these two.</p><p>I approached his highness and slapped his cheek.</p><p>“Lord Dantalian. Please come to your senses.”</p><p>His highness looked up at me with dull eyes.</p><p>“Mademoiselle……Madem—?”</p><p>“The meeting will be held in 2 hours. Forty Demon Lords will be  attending. It is the Walpurgis Night. Does your highness plan to put  yourself to shame during such an occasion as well?”</p><p>“Bonjour—?”</p><p>This was wrong.</p><p>Leaving his highness alone, I approached Miss De Farnese. Once I drew  near, Miss Farnese stood abruptly. And then did she not spread both of  her arms out horizontally? I was at a loss for words for a moment by  this bizarre conduct.</p><p>“……Miss. What are you doing right now?”</p><p>“This young lady is a tree.”</p><p>“A tree?”</p><p>“Because I am a tree, I cannot answer your question. Trees have no words.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>She was a bit insane.</p><p>I pondered if I was going to have to handle, with this peasant body,  the honor of being the very first person in all of history to speak with  a plant. Regardless, it appeared much easier to converse with the miss  than his highness. To have to choose between a man who had regressed  back into a toddler and a girl who had become a human plant. It was the  extremity of choices.</p><p>“Exactly when did you become intoxicated?”</p><p>“This young lady isn’t intoxicated, though?”</p><p>Surely.</p><p>“Then I will change the question. When did you start smoking?”</p><p>“Mm. That is quite the religious question.”</p><p>Miss Farnese nodded her head with an emotionless face.</p><p>“This young lady has a question as well. Will you answer?”</p><p>“Yes, as long as it is not a question concerning the vegetation of trees.”</p><p>“Why is it bright outside the window all of a sudden? It was clearly  dark a second ago. That is rather unusual. It seems the sun has gone  insane.”</p><p>The thing to have gone insane is not the sun, but you.</p><p>……My head hurt.</p><p>It seems his highness and the miss have been smoking gaya throughout the entire night.</p><p>When it was his highness alone, I was able to tighten the regulations  of his highness’ household, but after Miss De Farnese squeezed in,  everything became tangled. His highness continued to teach the miss  detrimental habits, and the miss accepted everything with open arms. It  was like a baby bird shoving its beak towards the mother bird’s mouth to  receive food. From drinking habits, sleeping habits, to smoking habits,  the miss became a carbon copy of his highness.</p><p>It’s fun since it’s like raising a little sister, was his highness’  statement. I consider it to be sincerely fortunate that his highness  Dantalian does not have any relatives. If by any chance, his highness  had a child, then the world will end on that day. It was not a joke.</p><p>“Miss De Farnese. If his highness decides to do something reckless,  then you must not go along with his antics. An outbreak of war will be  upon us soon, and the miss will have to grasp military power and  discipline his highness’ military personnel. What soldiers would trust  and follow a general who does drugs from a young age?”</p><p>“You are strange. This young lady is a tree so how could she manage soldiers?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Mii-n, mi— minmin—.”</p><p>She wasn’t a tree, but a cicada.</p><p>Putting me to the side, his highness and the miss had a conversation.</p><p>“Bonjour— bonshouuur—.”</p><p>“Minminmii-n……miin, mii-im.”</p><p>“Mam……Mama—?”</p><p>“Minmin—.”</p><p>“Shaba daba do?”</p><p>“Miiii-m, miiim……”</p><p>At last, the two had arrived at the creation of their own language.  The sight of a new language being born was before me. How marvelous. It  was so phenomenal that no words could come from my mouth. Especially  since the miss was clinging to my thigh and drooling, it was quite the  sight.</p><p>Miss De Farnese’ face looked perfectly fine, but the ecology of the inside of her head was simply a mystery.</p><p>Her face was void of emotion and there was no tone in her voice. It  was difficult to guess her mood. Although I was indeed the same in  having no expressions on my face, in my case, I had thrown away my  psyche, while she did not have a psyche. Throwing away one’s mind is  something done by one’s own volition, so there is still a slight heart  remaining there. However, discussing a psyche that never existed in the  first place is impossible.</p><p>I stared into the miss’ eyes, which were as green as the early summer thickets, for a long period of time.</p><p>There was absolutely nothing in the miss’ eyes. In order to  understand the other party, one must use the sparsely placed emotions  shone within their eyes to cross from this side to theirs. There was not  even a single fragment of emotion, which I could use to step on, within  the miss’ eyes. I could not see the other side. It felt distant like  when closely facing a large blank sheet of paper. What his highness  Dantalian discovered in that desolate bottom, what he planned to fill it  with, how he planned to color it, even as his lover, I could not fathom  his intentions.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“……”</p><p>A little.</p><p>Should I test it out a little?</p><p>I examined his highness’ movements. His breathing was gentle. He most  likely was not going to wake up anytime soon. Turning my gaze away from  his highness, I spoke.</p><p>“Miss. I have a question. Will you care to answer it?”</p><p>“A cicada does not inquire and only responds continuously throughout  the summer. A cicada answers when the sunlight of summer falls upon them  in question, but this young lady is not certain if it is summer now.  Mii-n, mim—.”</p><p>“What kind of person was your mother?”</p><p>“My mother was a slave.”</p><p>Laura De Farnese answered immediately.</p><p>“She lived as a slave and gave birth to this young lady after being  raped. On the day this young lady was born, my mother was killed. It was  a covert murder. There were no records or any keepsakes, so this young  lady does not know any more than this.”</p><p>The miss tilted her head.</p><p>“Did my response properly answer big sister Lapis’ question?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>It was a lie.</p><p>The reaction that I wanted was something a bit more intense.</p><p>For the sake of dragging out even a handful of subterranean water from that barren well that is her mind, I questioned further.</p><p>“Were you perhaps abused because of your mother’s low status?”</p><p>“Yes. I was abused a lot.”</p><p>“There must have been many minor harassments.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>“I am curious as to how they harassed you. Would it be fine to ask?”</p><p>“Aah. It was trivial. They would give me food that had been spat on,  give me water with head lice or flies in them…… Despite that, there were  barely any days where I was starved or parched, so I was greatly  fortunate.”</p><p>“Which mistreatment do you remember the most?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>The girl held her breath for a moment.</p><p>In that spot where she had stopped breathing, I discovered the gap which I could pry through.</p><p>However, I did not rush. No matter what it was, I did not have the  habit of being hasty. If one was going to pick a flower from a road,  then you must approach it while walking slowly.</p><p>“Where do you escape to when you wish to avoid the abuse?”</p><p>“The library in an annexed building from the mansion……”</p><p>“The library, is it? I heard that you are fond of history books. The  scent from paper books is indeed pleasant. I as well, keep close to me  the aroma of books which have not been sullied by the hands of others.”</p><p>“This young lady, too, appreciates the smell of a sincerely opened hardcover book.”</p><p>“Since the library is in a separate building, the people there must  have been sparse. Running away to an area where people rarely approached  is an appropriate decision.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>“But they still came after you, did they not?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“There must have been many times where they simply let you off if you  fled, but there were also many days where they did not. If they  released you then it would have been fine, but they chased you till the  very end. At first to the hallway, and then all the way to your  bedroom…… slowly, one step, a single step at a time, they invaded your  territory a small portion at a time.”</p><p>Her shoulder trembled slightly.</p><p>I caught her.</p><p>“And finally to the library. They must have promised to not disturb  that location. How terrible of them. So was the library invaded as  well?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>She nodded her head.</p><p>Fundamentally, a person’s mentality resembled a fortress. People built a home modeled after themselves and raised a rampart.</p><p>In a calm and orderly way.</p><p>Similar to how one would siege a fortress in a field of battle.</p><p>Cut off their path of retreat, surround their ramparts, tighten the  guard around their castle gates, and finally, after capturing the  marginal villages around the castle, is when I will knock on the most  important castle.</p><p>“How old were you when they first invaded?”</p><p>“When I was 10…… in the summer……”</p><p>“I see. It was summer, huh? Was the weather hot?”</p><p>“I do not remember.”</p><p>“What could you hear?”</p><p>“The sound of cicadas……”</p><p>“The sound of the cicadas chirping resonated through the window, I see.”</p><p>“That is so. Through the window……”</p><p>“So you kept staring out the window. If one were to stay secluded in a  library and read books, then their eyes will often become hazy. You  must have frequently gazed at the window in order to release into the  air the lines which reverberated in your mind. What could you see in the  window?”</p><p>“A tree……”</p><p>“What kind of tree?”</p><p>“I do not know.”</p><p>“Please try to remember. You may not have known what kind of tree it  was, but you continued to stare at it. You did your utmost to not turn  your gaze away from there. In order to endure the abuse, you looked at  the tree. In order to forget it, you enraptured yourself to the sound of  the cicadas. You liked the strident cries from the cicadas.……”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Everything was arranged.</p><p>The entirety had almost fallen.</p><p>Finally, the most vital foothold.</p><p>The territory which you dislike the most being taken away from you, and the area that I was targeting since the very beginning.</p><p>I will break it now.</p><p>“Who invaded?”</p><p>“…………”</p><p>The trembling in her shoulders spread throughout her entire body.</p><p>The miss lowered her head. She shook her head as if she was trying to  shake away her shudder. That was her final resistance. Honestly, it was  laughable.</p><p>“It is okay, miss. It is an incident that you have endured long ago  and have already overcome. Who was the person that had chased you all  the way to the inside of the library?”</p><p>“My father, did.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“I closed the door…… I definitely closed the door tight, but because I mistakenly did not lock it with the key……”</p><p>I see.</p><p>I thought about the stifling heat of that summer day.</p><p>The sight of the scorching heat pressing down on the silence.</p><p>“Why did you not lock the door?”</p><p>“Since everyone would get mad if I locked it. Just that……”</p><p>“Did it hurt a lot?”</p><p>“The cicadas cried a lot.”</p><p>I stopped my words.</p><p>“They really cried a lot. A long time…… continuously—”</p><p>Miss Farnese repeated the same words. There was no tone in her voice so the echoes felt distant.</p><p>Perhaps.</p><p>This was probably the opportunity.</p><p>Lord Dantalian showed affection for this girl before me. Although  there was no noticeable carnal desire in his love, since long ago I was  vigilant towards love without sexual appetite the most.</p><p>Sexual desire is explicit. It goes in the hole that must be gone in,  and when it welcomes the path that it must welcome, it reaches  satisfaction. It is a desire with a fixed direction. Different types of  love went around poking here and there chaotically without any  direction, and once it tires of poking, it pesters the other party to  teach them the way. In the end, they do not learn how to relieve their  desires, but they learn how to withdraw their cravings and endure it,  thus resulting in them rotting from the inside out.</p><p>Rather, if his highness embraced this girl in front of me.</p><p>That thought came up all of a sudden.</p><p>The miss will most likely hang by the neck by his highness’ love. But  what would happen if there was no carnal desire there? She will have no  method to respond to his highness’ affection. Unable to untangle his  highness from her mind, it will continue to pile up and— slowly occupy  her mind further.</p><p>At one point, her mind will be filled with nothing but his highness.  The inability to respond to the other party, she will most likely try to  repay with herself. Devote her everything to his highness. I am  immensely concerned. If his highness drifted even a slight distance away  from this miss, then would she not drag him into the bottom of her  heart and try to drown together with his highness?</p><p>That was why now was the opportunity to break her.</p><p>Before his highness was sufficiently engraved into the miss’ heart.</p><p>Before she suffocated by his highness’ affection.</p><p>I will crush her mind completely.</p><p>No matter how much the miss’ psyche was like that of a white sheet of  paper, you cannot write love or any sort of line on scraps of paper  which were torn apart into hundreds of thousands of pieces. It was fine.  The method of breaking her apart was simple. Words could slice one’s  heart with more ease than blades.</p><p>Like this, all I had to do was whisper words into Miss Farnese’s ear  and her heart would swallow the blade on its own and tear her mind into  shreds.</p><p>Ο</p><p>You are a revolting and trash-like whore who was raped by her father.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—with these words.</p><p>Did Miss Farnese become tired after having repeated the same words  over and over again? She had fallen onto my leg and gone slack. However,  she did not fall asleep yet.</p><p>In order for the curse to seep in distinctly, I brought my mouth as  close to the miss’ ear as possible. I will welcome your resentment,  Laura De Farnese. If the ability to blame another still exists within  your mind, that is.</p><p>“Lapis. Leave it there.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“I do not know what you are planning to say, but leave it at there.”</p><p>His highness’ voice pulled me from behind.</p><p>I turned my head towards that irrefutable voice. Lord Dantalian was smiling bitterly.</p><p>“……Your highness.”</p><p>“She is still a child.”</p><p>“She will one day grow into an adult.”</p><p>“You are overstepping your boundary.”</p><p>Within that slight conversation, we were able to read each other’s  intentions. We were in a relationship where we have not concealed  anything from one another and did not plan to conceal anything in the  future as well. I did not obscure my hostility.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“If anything, this is lighter than overstepping a boundary. Was your  highness eavesdropping this entire time? This one thought your highness  had fallen asleep.”</p><p>“I was listening since your ability in handling people is quite  adept. Do not forcefully pull out or forcefully tear apart that child’s  heart. I wish to observe her.”</p><p>“Your highness. People’s minds are naturally revealed on their own,  and the thing which people expose on their own is also, indeed, their  mind. If nothing becomes revealed and nothing is exposed, then there is  no other choice but to pull it out by force.”</p><p>“And so? Now that you have drawn it out, how is it? Are you satisfied?”</p><p>“It is dangerous.”</p><p>I declared.</p><p>“By ruining herself, she has the physiognomy of ruining your highness  as well. Because of her bottomless heart, it feels like every person to  approach her side will plummet. This one does not desire for your  highness to fall.”</p><p>I was firmly confident in my ability to discern others.</p><p>Up until now, the one and only person that I had misjudged was his highness Dantalian.</p><p>Since Lord Dantalian alone had taken both my first mistake and my first love, he was truly an exception among exceptions.</p><p>“……Miss Farnese is unable to sleep even when it becomes night.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“This is an assumption, but she was most likely abused every night.  That is why she stays up throughout the night reading. She is abiding  the night through books. Until she becomes exhausted to the point where  she can no longer turn to the next page, is when she passes out and  finally sleeps. During the night where I met her for the first time,  Miss Farnese was reading inside of her cell.”</p><p>His highness pulled out a pipe and bit down on it. The scent of a  burning tobacco leaf spread throughout the bedroom. His highness gazed  at the smoke cloud which he made with his own mouth.</p><p>“How is it, Lapis? Is it not adorable how desperate that child is?”</p><p>“Haa.”</p><p>A sigh flowed from my lips.</p><p>His highness Dantalian had the habit of treating a serious topic as a joke.</p><p>It was a fairly unpleasant mannerism.</p><p>“It is not too late to dispose of her.”</p><p>“No. She is a child with many uses.”</p><p>“Then can your highness toss her away once her uses are gone?”</p><p>His highness did not answer. Instead, he smoked his pipe. It appeared  as if he was hoping that the smoke from his pipe would express the  words that he wished to say.</p><p>After a fair amount of time, his highness spoke.</p><p>“Since she is a child which I brought back with the intention to espouse, I shall do so.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>His highness’ words were distant because they were imperious.</p><p>Although this goal of dragging the future, which people could not  handle, towards us and cutting that fate into pieces to manage one  portion at a time befitted his highness, I worried that his highness may  have been burying the fact that there was no end to his words.</p><p>……Your highness. Words are like the drowned, they have the ability to  sink people downwards. The word known as love is the strongest among  these, so it will drag you down the furthest. That was why we had set  down a safety net by telling each other that we loved authority the most  back when your highness and this one had confessed our love to each  other. In concern of this descent, this fall, and this collapse…… I kept  this monologue in the back of my throat.</p><p>As his highness would already know regardless of whether I informed  him or not, I was wary towards lightly pronouncing the word known as  love, thoughtlessly.</p><p>If that was so then.</p><p>“……This one will join as well.”</p><p>I wonder if my words came as a surprise, his highness’ eyes grew wide.</p><p>“What? Join what?”</p><p>“This one heard that the miss’ mother died early, so the miss should  not feel too awkward if this one were to fill that empty spot.”</p><p>“Wait. Through what method……?”</p><p>“Please console the miss’ mind properly, your highness. This one will  straighten the miss’ body. How to not lower one’s head, how to not  stutter one’s words, how to not dishevel one’s facial expressions, how  to not slouch one’s back, and how to not ruin one’s gait. This one will  educate her in these arts. Since she is a child from a refined birth, if  she masters these techniques she will become marvelous.”</p><p>“But I was planning to teach her all that myself……”</p><p>“Since your highness was born with a fully controlled body, your  highness’ gestures do not match the people below you. This one is a  peasant, and half of the miss is a peasant as well. The miss is a human,  and half of this one is human as well. This one’s mannerism will most  likely fit Miss Farnese more than your highness’ body movements. Please  make the miss learn discipline as a vassal instead of the methods of a  king.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Lapis, wouldn’t it be tiresome?”</p><p>His highness asked worriedly. A soft consideration was spread across  his face. His way of speech had also come undone and turned into a  normal tone. It was the expression and tone that his highness would  occasionally whisper to me with after sharing intimacy.</p><p>It was a bit sly.</p><p>If I were to hear a voice like that, then even I would have trouble refusing.</p><p>Therefore, I decided to be sly as well.</p><p>“Yes. Incredibly tiresome.”</p><p>“Euuk……!”</p><p>“Speaking honestly, it is absurd. This one is busy just preparing a  stratagem for war, but to have to worry about childcare as well? How  preposterous. It is a question whether your highness lives with any  thought at all.”</p><p>“Euh, uuuuuh……”</p><p>“That is why, could your highness grant this one a favor?”</p><p>Lord Dantalian wore a tearful face.</p><p>This was what it meant to knowingly suffer.</p><p>“I-If it’s a wish that I am capable of.”</p><p>“Do not unburden only the miss’ heart, but give her your body as  well. Stroke her head often and take care of her regularly. If the mind  and body are unable to keep up with one another, then this one fears the  situation of the miss’ mind wasting away in her body, and her body  being thrown away within her mind.”</p><p>His highness let out a long groan.</p><p>“Are you perhaps saying that if Miss Farnese were to request for my body, then I should present it to her?”</p><p>“That is so.”</p><p>“Lapis, you alone are enough for me.”</p><p>“It will not be excessive even with several people.”</p><p>“Children who are less developed like the miss are really not my type, and her chest is small as well.”</p><p>“This one apologizes, but if the person who is besotted with her highness Barbatos is to say that, then the credibility……”</p><p>“That is not me being besotted! That is Barbatos having eaten me! The power relation is completely on that side!”</p><p>“That may have been so at first, but that is no longer true after the  fact, is it not? Please collect your words, your highness. It is  embarrassing to hear your highness continue to make excuses.”</p><p>“Wait. Barbatos is a vitally crucial tool in executing our plan, is  she not? If that is so, since she has an extensive use instrumentally,  caring about making myself agreeable to her as she desires is……”</p><p>“Yes. Since your highness brought the miss since she has her  extensive uses as well, then your highness can put that same care to her  as well.”</p><p>Lord Dantalian put his hand against his forehead. Sorrily, his  highness has rarely ever won in an argument against me. That was because  I only fought when I knew I could win.</p><p>Needless to say, I loved as if I was fighting a war. Be it a  relationship or a war, it was a rule to fight only after one has  ascertained their victory. You were careless, your highness.</p><p>“……If. If I’m the father and Lapis is the mother, then that would  mean that Miss Farnese is our child. There is no law against a parent  and a child connecting, right?”</p><p>“She is not your real daughter anyway, so why does it matter?”</p><p>“Right. That’s right, isn’t it……”</p><p>His highness shrunk down. His final resistance was trampled with ease  and a white flag rose from the inside of his fortress. After seeing my  face which had become refreshed from having acquired a sound victory,  for some reason, the corners of his highness’ lips twisted.</p><p>“Lapis. A daughter has abruptly formed between us, has it not?”</p><p>“……That is so.”</p><p>I was apprehensive.</p><p>Every time his highness made that kind of expression, an absurd event would always occur.</p><p>“Since a daughter cannot be made without intercourse, it seems the two of us have to share intimacy right this instant.”</p><p>“……This one apologizes, but just now, was the order not reversed a bit?”</p><p>“I shall not listen to objections.”</p><p>His highness lifted me up abruptly and sat down on a chair.</p><p>While childishly shouting ‘yah!’ like some mischievous child, his highness embraced my body.</p><p>He was truly an unreasonable person.</p><p>“Your highness, the conference will be held in an hour.”</p><p>“If you are disappointed, then there is also the flavor of ending it with that lacking sensation.”</p><p>“Is the miss not sleeping? This one is worried that she will awaken by the noise.”</p><p>“Doing one’s best to not get caught is also a charm. Ah, do not  remove your socks. I oddly prefer it more when doing it while you still  have those on.”</p><p>This was wrong.</p><p>“This one will say it again, but the order is wrong. A daughter is  made after copulation, so why would one copulate after the daughter has  already been made?”</p><p>“Oho, order, is it? Lapis, did you not know till now? This is a  country of smoke where everything is backwards. People speak in reverse,  words are pronounced backwards, and thus, human relations are flipped  upside down as well.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>His highness placed his head against my chest and grinned.</p><p>“Repeat after me. uo-y, ev-ol, i.”</p><p>“uo-y, ev-ol-i?”</p><p>It was a gibberish line.</p><p>“What does it mean?”</p><p>“Now say that backwards. Then you will know.”</p><p>“uoy……”</p><p>I tried flipping each word around and pronounced it in my mouth. That was why if you ordered ‘uo-y, ev-ol, i’ in reverse.</p><p>i, lo-ve, y-ou.</p><p>……Therefore.</p><p>Ο</p><p>I love you.</p><p>Ο</p><p>……</p><p>I was dumbfounded.</p><p>To think that he would make such a childish joke.</p><p>A little girl, selling flowers for the first time on the streets, would most likely snort at such a play.</p><p>While receiving the entirety of my cold gaze, his highness whispered into my ear.</p><p>“We are going to bring upon a war from now on. A war where everything  will be turned upside down. Cause and effect will be reversed, voices  will be entangled, and people will be twisted. Nobles will become  peasants, and peasants will become nobles. In that world, Lapis, you and  I together will rise to the pinnacle.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“However, our love will not change. Even if the order of our love were to be reversed, it would still be love.”</p><p>Could you believe this?</p><p>All of this was an excuse given by his highness just to <strong>sleep with me once</strong>.</p><p>Amazing, your highness. How marvelous.</p><p>A great individual who would flip the entire world over in order to  have sexual relations with a single mixed blood shallow-minded succubus,  no matter how longstanding the history of the continent was, most  likely solely Lord Dantalian alone existed as such an individual.</p><p>Of course, separate from that, I did not feel impressed at all.</p><p>“……Does your highness not feel shame to say such words so boldly?”</p><p>“Shame? I threw that sort of emotion away into a trash bin long ago.”</p><p>“Please go retrieve your highness’ personality back from that trash bin.”</p><p>“Geez. Even though you like it on the inside, Lapis. You’re trying to play it off.”</p><p>Dear lord.</p><p>I was speechless.</p><p>If a brazen-faced person was intelligent, then how dreadfully  narcissistic of an individual they would become, I could understand by  looking at Lord Dantalian.</p><p>In order for his highness to regain his senses, he would have to meet an individual as preposterous as himself.</p><p>This was where the problem lay. The world was already handling Lord  Dantalian. With that alone, the world has already run out of any surplus  space. For two people, who are similar to Lord Dantalian, to exist.  Just this hypothesis was enough to violate the laws of nature.</p><p>“Haa……”</p><p>While abandoning my resistance and calculating what I had to do in  order to most efficiently and quickly squeeze out Lord Dantalian, I  covered his highness’ eyes with my hand. If we were to not be late for  the meeting, then there was a need to rush. But that was fine. Despite  my appearance, half of my blood was that of a succubus.</p><p>I am an expert.</p><p>Ο</p><p>♦</p><p>Ο</p><p>The conference had arrived at its final stage.</p><p>Although Paimon continued to elucidate the prohibition of war, there  was a clear lack of strength in her voice. Paimon as well most likely  understood how the conclusion of the gathering was going to end. His  highness did not go out of his way to prevent Paimon’s voice. He merely  observed Paimon with empty eyes that appeared as if they were marveling a  single piece of art.</p><p>……People’s minds are naturally revealed on their own, and the thing  which people exposed on their own was also, indeed, their mind. However,  the mind that appeared from his highness and the mind which his  highness revealed was peculiar so it was occasionally difficult for  myself to grasp his meaning.</p><p>Lazily sleeping in and doing drugs throughout the night was also his  highness. Cunningly embellishing war was also, indeed, his highness.  Slyness secretly seeped into laziness, and laziness boldly resided  within slyness. Whenever I looked at his highness, a single spider—I am  reminded of a poisonous spider laying its body on spiderweb and sleeping  leisurely. The entire world was like a web to his highness, therefore,  his highness resting peacefully meant that he was hunting.</p><p>“……?”</p><p>His highness suddenly turned towards my direction. Since I was  perceived as a peasant, I was unable to approach the center of the  conference room. I could only view the meeting from a distance. To that  me, his highness moved his lips. There was no sound.</p><p>What sort of play could that be?</p><p>That was an insulting behavior towards the sacred Walpurgis Night. It was inexcusable. A slight headache came to me.</p><p>Through lipreading, I read each word that came from Lord Dantalian’s lips that were not pronounced.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>nia-ga, em, rof, lla-f, uo-y, did…… gniza-ma, ton, I, ma?</p><p>It did not establish a sentence at all.</p><p>It was neither Habsburgian nor Franconian. From what language that  was from, I could not……no. Wait a moment. His highness was the type of  person to use the same joke daily. If I were to read it backwards like I  did earlier, then it may make sense. ‘nia-ga, em, rof, lla-f, uo-y,  did, gniza-ma, ton, I, ma’, if I were to read this in reverse, then—.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Am I not amazing? Did you fall for me again?</p><p>Ο</p><p>……</p><p>While experiencing my gaze turning thin like a rotten fish in real time, I moved my lips.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Please kill yourself immediately.</p><p>Ο</p><p>The jokes continued on until the break of day. At 4 o’clock in the  morning was when the Demon Lords finally voted on whether they were  going to go to war or not. This was the exact result.</p><p>Total participants in the meeting, 63 people.</p><p>Yes for war, 38 votes.</p><p>No for war, 21 votes.</p><p>Abstained, 4 people.</p><p>Since the approval votes were more than half the amount of total  participants, the war was determined. Everything was flowing towards the  direction which Lord Dantalian desired. Rank 1st Demon Lord Baal, rank  2nd Agares, and rank 3rd Vassago did not partake in this gathering, so  this decision of war could be considered to have been handled with more  haste than caution, but—</p><p>What was the problem?</p><p>There was no flaw according to the law.</p><p>We could now <strong>conduct war legitimately</strong>. If we were to  speculate that the function of war was to kill humans, then just now,  through the conference a second ago, we were presented the rights to  murder the humans legitimately. The legal and illegal boundary drawn on  death, which was made due to people being unsatisfied after being  concerned with the legal and illegal laws on life, was laughable. It was  the funniest joke that I have heard all year. Surely his highness  Dantalian was bursting out in laughter on the inside.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— When should we teach the humans a lesson?</p><p>— It should be sufficient to start moving when the cold lessens a bit around the 3rd month.</p><p>— Once we pillage them a fair amount, the humans will be shocked and  lower their bodies on their own. I shall call together a race meeting  and inform the youngsters.</p><p>— It’s been a long time since I got a warm up.</p><p>Ο</p><p>The complexions of the Demon Lords were light.</p><p>It was clear. No one here was interpreting this resolution of war on a  full-scale. They were looking at it as a simple war to plunder. And  this was referring to just the Plains Faction. The Mountain Factions had  taken this as a small skirmish within diplomatic affairs. They were  seriously discussing the topic of sending an envoy to both the empire  and kingdom to reprimand the humans of their wickedness. It was a  comedy.</p><p>How easily they spat out words.</p><p>How fatal it was for an individual to decide on a war, where people killed and were killed by others, with mere words.</p><p>These people will have to shoulder that responsibility on their own.</p><p>Among the Demon Lords, only Paimon had a dark complexion until the  very end. After seeing the results of the vote, Paimon lamented for a  long period of time. She cleared her throat. The warning that she left  behind remained in the ceiling and echoed throughout.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— When this war started and where it came from, we do not know this.  Since we do not know when the war had started, we will not know when to  end it. Since we do not know where the war had come from, we will not  know where to go in order to end it. Everyone, do you not feel dizzy?  This lady feels light-headed. It should not be possible to contain the  weight of lives with the lightness of words, and yet this lady worries  for that one thing. That our soldiers will have to endure that heaviness  because of our frivolousness……</p><p>Ο</p><p>After deciding to gather at the Plains of Jatvingians on the 2nd month and 15th day to advance together, the meeting was over.</p><p><em>(TL note: Changed Jötunheimr to Jatvingians)</em></p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Weakest Demon Lord, Rank 71st, Dantalian<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1505, Month 12, Day 7</p><p> Niflheim, Governor’s Palace</p></h4><p>The conference had dispersed.</p><p>I waited for everyone to make their way out.</p><p>While staring up at the dark ceiling, I dwelled on the words Paimon  left behind. Paimon’s lamentation of not knowing where it had come from  and not knowing where it would go, was honestly magnificent. While the  other Demon Lords were trying to make their way through the cloud of  smoke which Barbatos and I had spread out, Paimon was concerned about  where the smoke had come from. It was only her. The sole person to have  tried to look past the smoke.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The meeting room was empty. The servants blew out the candles. It  felt like I was by myself in the backstage of a performance hall where  the actors had left and the audience had departed.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— I’m sorry…… I’m sorry……</p><p>Ο</p><p>Now that I think about it.</p><p>Even back during the time she had collapsed after receiving my  retaliation in this room, Paimon apologized exceedingly sincerely. The  rank 9th woman apologized with tears to the rank 71st me. I suddenly  feared her lucidity that could apologize sincerely and lament honestly.  Paimon will most likely not make the same mistake twice.</p><p>Crossing through the empty conference room, Lapis came to my side. She then asked.</p><p>“What is your highness doing?”</p><p>“I am concerned about whether if I will have to have a single individual assassinated.”</p><p>“It will not be easy.”</p><p>Lapis responded calmly. There were no signs of her being surprised by  my words. She did not even ask who the person I was considering to  assassinate was. I knew that Lapis was contemplating the exact same  thing as myself in her mind.</p><p>“Sitri is always by that person’s side.”</p><p>“Sitri?”</p><p>“The rank 12th Demon Lord. If one were to rank them by personal  strength, then rank 2nd Agares is at the highest, rank 8th Barbatos is  second, and after that is Sitri at third. Since she follows that person  like an elder sister and does not leave their side for even a moment, it  will be difficult for an assassin to get through.”</p><p>“Aah.”</p><p>I recalled the event from the past. The time Paimon had fallen after  receiving my counterattack, there was a female Demon Lord who supported  her and left. I could not see her face, but she must have been Sitri.</p><p>I then remembered Torukel. The old goblin merchant Torukel. Looking  back at it, did that merchant not commit suicide in order to protect  Paimon as well? I let out a long groan.</p><p>“Is that so. Paimon is blessed with people, I see. Her loyal  subjects protect her by forming the rampart, so it would be difficult to  break through from the outside. Since she is an individual who worries  for even the campfire lit by the privates, it would be a cluster.”</p><p>“Will you leave it be?”</p><p>“I cannot see the means yet. Loyalty does not form by itself. They  are loyal to Paimon because she is able to fill the thing that they are  unable to fill themselves. I must first find out what Paimon is  providing them……”</p><p>Lapis lowered herself to one knee. She gently leaned her head against  my thigh. In the center of the empty conference room, we silently felt  each other’s silence.</p><p>Suddenly having a craving for contact, I pressed my lips against  Lapis’. No matter how you looked at it, one hour was not enough. I  wanted to fill the lacking sensation that was left from before the  conference started now that the meeting was over. Lapis let out a  breath.</p><p>“Your highness. This is a sacred place……”</p><p>“Does that not make it better?”</p><p>This was a sacred location which only Demon Lords attended and Lapis  Lazuli was a peasant. By my cruel joke of suggesting to dirty the most  divine area with the defamatory of a peasant, Lapis shut her mouth. We  were accomplices. Lovers who were wounded by the world brought those  scars and shared it with one another, but there was no need for that for  lovers who were trying to damage the world. Within the gaps of our  intertwined flesh, the sound of breathing dug in deeply.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—……</p><p>—……</p><p>Ο</p><p>We rubbed our skin together as long as possible and overlapped one  another’s flesh as widely as possible. We also held back our sound as  much as possible. When the gasps of either her or myself would leak out  at times, the sound reached as high as the ceiling. Throughout the night  a blizzard raged on outside the window. It felt like the snow was  covering the cracked fields that were especially arid. The wounds of the  earth will be buried under the snow.</p><p>At dawn, the sound of snow had ceased in the world.</p>"

      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><h1>Chapter 2 (Part&nbsp;1)</h1><h4><strong>Chapter 2 – Winter (Part 1)</strong></h4><p><strong>Warning: This chapter has violent and gory scenes.</strong></p><hr><p>Ο</p><p>“Try calling me father.”</p><p>“Are you insane, Lord?”</p><p>I organized my army throughout the winter.</p><p>The tempers of the soldiers were fierce and violent. They couldn’t stand the sight of a 16-year-old broad pretending to be a general. Whenever I glared at them, the soldiers would quickly move to obey, but it was for that moment only. In areas with no watching eyes, the military personnel criticized Miss Farnese. Thanks to the witches having spread their familiars around, we were able to vividly listen in on the soldiers talking behind our backs.</p><p>“Listen well.”</p><p>Having recorded their words onto a Memory Play artifact, I allowed Farnese to listen to it in full. The soldiers referred to Miss Farnese as ‘human harlot’.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— We’re demons, but why is some human harlot crawling here and saying she’s going to command us? What kind of fresh bullshit is this?</p><p>— It’s raw bullshit. That’s what it is.</p><p>— But that young broad’s appearance is nice.</p><p>— Who goes to war to look at someone’s face? We fight to take the necks with those faces attached to ’em. Even if that human harlot memorized a couple of lines from an art of war manual, I doubt even low fry officials would be intimidated by her after hearing that she read some books.</p><p>— Who knows? All of our heads might go down after being pushed down by her hips and hearing her moan.</p><p>Ο</p><p>The privates laughed loudly. We could also hear the objurgatory nagging from someone on the side telling them that trying to score a broad, one that his highness Demon Lord had already had his way with, was a dangerous action. However, it was not said in a way of speech where they were reproaching them seriously. It was said in a joking tone surrounded by jest. Listening up to that point, I closed the artifact.</p><p>“What do you think?”</p><p>“It seems the soldiers are recklessly saying whatever they want while not knowing anything about this young lady.”</p><p>Farnese muttered with an emotionless face.</p><p>“This young lady has never shared a bed with your lordship. What troublesome people.”</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>That part wasn’t the issue.</p><p>A little bit more, how do you say it? Is there not a more important problem lying dormant? If I were to point it out in more detail, then there’s the fact that your military command is not receiving even a seedling of respect. Despite having heard my comment, Farnese’s face was still devoid of emotion. She did not even turn her gaze towards me, but instead, silently continued to read her history book. While reading her book, Farnese muttered.</p><p>“It is not possible to take apart and fix a problem within an army with ease. Them being unable to simply accept an outsider, in other words, means that they are already firmly tied together on the inside. Since they are sturdy on the inside, they will not lightly fall apart when facing the enemy. They are elites.”</p><p>“And so?”</p><p>“If&nbsp;this young lady were to slit the throats of&nbsp;the centurions and decani, then the sturdy army will fall apart from the inside and descend into being a mere&nbsp;crowd. The captains who cursed at this young lady would be cut down, and their positions will be filled by fellows who are good at flattering this young lady. Instead of captains with ability, captains who are good at bootlicking will end up receiving preferential treatment, and that is not correct. An army is a body of people that is essentially tied together by both the inner and outer workings. This young lady fears the foolishness of remodeling the outer layer only to have the inner layer deteriorate.”</p><p>I carefully examined Farnese’s complexion.</p><p>Despite having heard the vulgar words spat out by the lowly privates, there were no signs of her showing any resistance towards it. The only thing that was there was the sight of her contemplating what she was going to have to do in order to properly manage the privates while treating them not as people, but as tools.</p><p>Laura De Farnese was a psychopath.</p><p>Nevertheless, she was a clever psychopath.</p><p>“Would it be permissible to leave all of the military commands to you?”</p><p>“Did your lordship not retrieve this young lady from the slave market in order to let her reign over your troops? It is fine for your lordship to not worry. Military affairs are this young lady’s task. Since it is an issue confronting this young lady, this young lady shall manage it herself.”</p><p>I knew that my concern was unnecessary.</p><p>With the intention of finishing this conversation with a test, I reprimanded her.</p><p>“Would military affairs be managed just because someone like you says they can handle it?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Your lordship’s words are rather aggressive. Instead of using words to instill fear into this young lady, use a goal to light a path for her.”</p><p>“I shall give you one month. Within 30 days, have control of the military discipline. If you are unable to uphold the big talk you have just now made, then I shall lash you for the crime of thoughtlessly flapping your mouth.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>Farnese still did not remove her gaze from her book. Since I had harshly opened the path in front of her, it was time to softly support the path behind her. I asked her allusively.</p><p>“Is there nothing I can help with?”</p><p>“Please assign the witches’ familiars to this young lady. This young lady shall use the familiars as her eyes and ears, and utilize them to examine the things which this young lady cannot see or hear.”</p><p>“An easy request.”</p><p>“Ah, also—.”</p><p>Farnese spoke.</p><p>“Why did your lordship say that you would become this lady’s father?”</p><p>“The privates are disregarding you because you are a child of a human. I figured that the contempt towards you would lessen if I were to adopt you as my daughter.”</p><p>Farnese collected her gaze from her book. She was finally looking towards my direction, but for some reason, her eyes were full of suspicion. It almost felt like she was treating me as food waste.</p><p>“That is quite indecent. Those words may not be wrong, but your lordship’s way of thought is pitiable.&nbsp;In the entire world, what lord would try to solve a military affair through adoption? Although this young lady has felt it before, but your lordship is a bit insane. You are at least not normal.”</p><p>Why do you care!?</p><p>You’re the psychopath!</p><p>Ο</p><p>♦</p><p>Ο</p><p>Farnese submerged herself into the inner layer of military affairs. Farnese laid down her bedding at the side of the quarters where the soldiers rested and played. The general resided wearing the uniform worn by privates, a single set of a mat and blanket, and a poor quality bowl. She was planning to live alongside the troops.</p><p>The captains flocked to me and complained.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— It is uncomfortable since the general had abruptly entered our area.</p><p>— Since the general is nearby, even when we’re receiving breakfast with our bowls, before we can get our portion of soup we end up glancing at the general once. While peeking at the general, we end up chewing the meat in our soup one less time. Since we are frequently being mindful of the general, we often forget to chew, therefore, we have no energy after our meals and easily have upset stomachs. They say that people shouldn’t bother even a village mutt when it’s eating, but how are we expected to fight properly when the general is interfering with the meals of the subordinates? Please understand.</p><p>— Please understand, your highness.</p><p>Ο</p><p>I scratched my forehead.</p><p>I see these bastards are low-mindedly throwing a fit over their meal. They are sullying my name. Since you guys are rattling on like goats, I shall behave narrow-mindedly as well. Let us see how you bastards cope with my angered performance.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, I unloaded words like a round of bullets.</p><p>“Are you all discussing domiciliary before the king? So be it then. I shall inform you all of your domestics. All of the food which you all shove into your faces every morning&nbsp;comes from me. The dinner you all stuff inside yourselves and the shit that comes out of your bodies, all of that comes from me. When your swords are broken, who will you go to in order to request for them to be fixed? Who will seek for the blacksmith? Who will obtain the horse and wagon to load the weapons onto and send to the blacksmith, and who will provide the food and accommodations for the coachmen who will be traveling back and forth? I am the household manager. You ungrateful fellows. I am telling you that I am your monarch. Just because you feel slightly uncomfortable by the fact that you have to be a bit more mindful and chew a bit less, you came all the way to my premises to make a fuss?”</p><p>I grabbed the wooden pillow which I was using for my nap and threw it at the captains. Once the wooden pillow hit the floor and bounced, the captains’ spines shivered. The captains lowered their heads further.</p><p>The mannerism of speech I used when handling Demon Lords and the tone I used when dealing with military captains were distinctly different. I did not allow them to run far away by needlessly behaving high and mighty in front of the captains . Instead, I lowered myself to their level and made them sink their heads while being unable to move an inch. That was my stratagem.</p><p>“These ignorant fools.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Your words are immeasurable, your highness!</p><p>— We are to blame, your lordship!</p><p>— Our thoughts were short.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ο</p><p>“Good. Seeing that you all are able to apologize with such ease, I will not make you repent deeply. Laura De Farnese is the general giving military commands in my stead, she is the acting general. Wherever I am not, she is your monarch. The reason why I am not punishing you all right this instant is not because I have accepted your apology, but because I want you all to go to the acting general and finish your apology. A mistake which occurs within the army must be forgiven by the general.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>— But, your highness.</p><p>— We fight with the strength given to us by our food. If we are unable to eat our meals properly, then.</p><p>— We do not mean that, but.</p><p>Ο</p><p>These fuckers?</p><p>I drew a sword.</p><p>“Should I personally assist in making your meals go down your throats with more ease?”</p><p>At that moment was when the captains finally fled. Since their steps felt more feeble than refreshing, I chased after them. The captains were surprised and let out a scream. I picked up the wooden pillow and tossed it once more, and since I was gifted as a pitcher, the wooden pillow hit the exact center of the back of a&nbsp;captain’s head. The captains escaped. And like so, I covered for Farnese.</p><p>I trusted Laura De Farnese who was destined to be the greatest commander in the continent like in the original history.</p><p>Sure enough, after 4 days, Farnese figured out the problem within the army. While wearing the military uniform meant for privates, Farnese came to inform me.</p><p>“The irrationality within the troops is immense, lord.”</p><p>“What kind of irrationality?”</p><p>“If there is a regimental commander, a centurion, and a decanus, then that is sufficient. Despite that, the regimental commanders give their duties to the centurions, the centurions give their duties to the decani, and the decani give their duties to the privates. In the end, the privates take care of everything within the army. Even the privates, having become tired of this, distinguish the high and low among themselves. The low privates then spread the bedding for the higher privates and do their laundry.”</p><p>“An issue that is prominent in any military.”</p><p>“Privates should fight like privates and centurions should fight like centurions, and yet, why are they ordering around others just for the sake of making their own lives easier? This young lady, who is the general, should be the one commanding the privates, but since there are so many superiors who are making the privates do things, it is as if they have several generals at the same time. There is no chance military command would be able to gather together as one and pervade deeply within an army of this sort.”</p><p>I spat on the floor. My throat often felt parched because it was winter.</p><p>“Can you solve it?”</p><p>“This young lady shall crush it with ease.”</p><p>I preferred to leave irrationality as it was and&nbsp;manipulate it appropriately, but it seems Laura De Farnese was the complete opposite. Enduring irrationality or bearing with her alone, I considered which side would be more convenient.</p><p>“Very well then. Perform as you wish.”</p><p>“This young lady shall perform for your lordship’s goal.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>Farnese started to handle the military discipline more severely.</p><p>From this point on, be it captain, veteran, or newcomer, regardless of one’s rank or experience, Farnese established a rule where everyone must manage their own livelihood by themselves. She stepped forward on her own. Farnese washed her uniform by herself and personally cleaned her own military boots. One day, when a private brought her meal for her, Farnese told him off in a loud voice.</p><p>“Put that away. Do I not have my own arms and mouth?”</p><p>Farnese did not eat at all on that day. Once the commander cast away the bowl, the soldiers did not know what to do. From that day on, the sight of privates presenting meals for the veteran soldiers disappeared.</p><p>However, at this point, it had only vanished on the outside.</p><p>Something that&nbsp;dissipated on the outside was bound to hide deeply on the inside.</p><p>During an ambitious night, the veteran soldiers secretly gathered the privates and abused them. Using the familiars, we were able to listen in on this sound of violence flowing from the corner of the encampment in real-time.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Hey, get your heads straight you bastards. You think that human harlot is going to live in our quarters forever? She’s the type of bitch to leave in half a month. Once she does, you guys will die by my hands.</p><p>— Think carefully about who is&nbsp;truly taking care of you guys. That human harlot is someone like his highness and not people like us. I’ll give you an honest advice, stay in line.</p><p>— Yes, we understand!</p><p>Ο</p><p>Be it here or there, the repertoire is quite the same—.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>While I was turning my ear towards the audio and receiving a feeling of longing, Farnese muttered beside me.</p><p>“……I see they are challenging me to see who will win.”</p><p>Oh?</p><p>It may have been just my imagination, but that appeared like a slightly angered face. Since it was rather rare for Farnese to show any emotion, it was intriguing.</p><p>Since that day, Farnese began to go on night patrols.</p><p>She did not wander around openly but feigned it as a coincidence whenever possible. For example, pretending to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and swooping in on violence that was occurring in a warehouse, or pretending to wake up because of a presence and examining the backside of the quarters. It was an obvious trick. Of course, there was no tactic that worked as efficiently as an obvious trick. Think about it. It’s the commander appearing out of nowhere from the darkness. The privates could only be frightened.</p><p>“What are you all doing?”</p><p>The senior officers who were mistreating the privates could not respond.</p><p>With an emotionless face, Farnese announced.</p><p>“I see. People who do not sleep when required to sleep must fight quite well when required to fight. I am relieved that you all form a strong army as one. The senior officers over there, follow me.”</p><p>Farnese made the senior soldiers do manual labor. Giving them each a pickaxe, she ordered them to dig. Since the earth had hardened due to the cold, the ends of the pickaxe were unable to pierce the ground. Looking at the impenetrable dirt, the soldiers made a fire in order to melt the ground. After lighting the fire, they dug down until a low mound was piled up in the barracks. Farnese looked down at the soldiers and gave another order.</p><p>“Well done. Now fill it back up.”</p><p>The officers poured the dirt, which they had dug up in vain, back into the pit. It took a whole 4 hours to dig and refill the hole. The ground had returned to being flat. Towards the veteran officers who thought their work was finally over and were wiping away their sweat, Farnese spoke coolly.</p><p><strong>“Dig again.”</strong></p><p>The faces of the veteran officers turned blue. For half a day, the soldiers repetitively dug and&nbsp;filled in holes. It was labor with no reason or goal. Since there was no goal, the end could not be seen, and since the end could not be seen, they could not endure the current situation. They most likely wanted to die. It must have felt like they were digging up their own graves. While keeping my hands behind my back and standing afar, I watched Farnese cheerfully torment the veteran soldiers. Speaking truthfully, it was pleasant.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Please kill me instead.</p><p>— Us humble ones have made a mistake, general!</p><p>Ο</p><p>The officers lowered their&nbsp;heads to the ground and bowed. This must have been the first time that Farnese was referred to as general by the soldiers. Farnese, with an expression as transparent as water, looked down at the soldiers.</p><p>“Why would I end your lives?&nbsp;No one cherishes you all as much as I do. Stop your chatter and continue digging.”</p><p>Farnese raised the edges of her mouth. Since she was still not used to making facial expressions, Farnese’s mouth twisted very strangely. That was more terrifying.</p><p>“Or do you perhaps want me to give you the hole on myself? Do all of you think you could satisfy me with those limp dicks of yours?”</p><p>The soldiers wailed out.</p><p>After that day.</p><p>The miss rose from being a normal harlot to being a wicked harlot.</p><p>In the past, the sound of voices saying ‘that harlot!’ in a ridiculing tone rose high into the air, but now, the voices uttered ‘that wicked harlot……’ in a vexed tone and sunk down low. Sounds that resonated high dissipated quickly, while the sounds that permeated low spread out wide.</p><p>A joyous occasion this was, quite joyous.</p><p>The captains&nbsp;came running to me once more. Different to before, their tone was greatly intense. An acute urgency could be felt. All of the captains now referred to Farnese as Miss General. It may have only been the single word ‘Miss’ being attached to ‘General’, but there was overall a lot of meaning there. For example, a meaning on the level of ‘that crazy bitch’ was inclined there. Was this not impressive progress?</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Since Miss General interferes with the soldiers not only during the afternoon but during the night as well, the youngsters are unable to sleep properly. Even if we lack energy after our meals, we can still fight with that emptiness. However, how are people to fight without sleep?</p><p>— This does not come from an art of war manual, but from life itself. People should read books based on life, but if someone were to live their life based on books, then would the world not be upside down? Even if Miss General’s knowledge is profound and she were to have read every book&nbsp;related to tactics in the nation, life is a separate matter. Lowly people like us live in life and have no other choice but to continue living in life. Please understand!</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ο</p><p>I motionlessly listened to the words coming from the captains. After hearing everything, I went to the warehouse and brought a pickaxe. It was the same pickaxe the senior officers had swung until they collapsed from exhaustion. I then spoke.</p><p>“I see your words are quite profound so they pierce an exquisite principle. Let us test how deep your bodies can be buried in the ground.”</p><p>The captains fled.</p><p>The month after, irrationality was completely suppressed within the troops. The custom of the centurions taking the wages of the decani, and the decani taking the wages of the privates disappeared. The tendency of loaning the money they’ve taken from others, and conspiring with outside peddlers and panders&nbsp;to sell items for an exorbitant price, also vanished.</p><p>Farnese was a vicious girl. The more that this fact spread out among the troops, in contrast, made the sounds of soldiers pointing towards her and calling her a wicked harlot shrink down. At one point, instead of a wicked harlot, the voices of people praising her as a general who thought of the privates before others, flowed throughout the army. This was most likely around the time that the 11th pit was created in the barracks.</p><p>The captains reacted sensitively towards the mood of the privates. Like how humans would automatically perceive the smell of flatulence, the captains understood the privates’ temper.</p><p>The captains read the atmosphere and obeyed the commander. They must have been afraid of the consequences for coming to me to complain unreasonably since the captains went around cheering ‘Hooray for Miss General Farnese!’. Captains that behaved as if they would lick the soles of Farnese’s feet&nbsp;crawled around. Among them, one fellow actually did try to put saliva on Farnese’s toes and was kicked.</p><p>Tsk tsk.</p><p>What adorable fellows.</p><p>Finally, the remnant group of individuals known as decani and senior officers remained.</p><p>These people were unable to throw away the pleasure of extorting money from the people below them. They were better than the privates but lower than the captains, so they were fellows similar to that of neighborhood thugs. These people lacked the political capability to react appropriately to the state of affairs like the captains had done. The senior officers tried to protect their authority and territory.</p><p>When the senior officers mistreated the privates, they went far. They dragged the privates out to one of the most remote warehouses in the encampment. A mouse, that was the familiar of a witch, eavesdropped on the voices leaking from the gaps on the wall.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Hey, bastards. Who’s the one that brought you bums from the village and enlisted you to the army? I’m the older guy that lived next door. You guys were born in the village first and not in the army, right? Then you guys should treat your seniors from the same village with respect!</p><p>— We may live in the unit right now, but when we die, we’ll do so back home. If you guys keep ignoring your seniors, then do you think a single mourner will show up to your funeral? Do you think that wicked harlot will go out of her way to arrange your funerals? She’s the bitch who’ll order you to die, not a bitch who’ll take care of you after you’ve died.</p><p>— Hey, don’t ignore us. We’re all saying this in consideration of you guys. Besides, no matter how much you scream here, that harlot won’t come.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Farnese threw open the door.</p><p><strong>“Yes. I am here because you called.”</strong></p><p>The soldiers screamed and fell to the floor. I could hear the sound of materials collapsing clamorously with a crash. I asked Farnese later on, but apparently, the soldiers were gazing up at her as if she was a ghost.</p><p>“It is fine to look forward to it, gentlemen. Let us dig holes properly today.”</p><p>The senior officers were forced to unearth dirt for 2 days straight without sleep.</p><p>At last, military discipline stood upright. The soldiers took care of their own domestics by themselves. If it wasn’t an official order from above, even the privates did not obey them thoughtlessly.</p><p>On the final day of the promised 1 month, Laura De Farnese discarded the uniform meant for privates and donned the military uniform for commanders. After washing herself, Farnese came to visit me with a clean body. Farnese’s skin was whiter than the snow that had just fallen onto the earth, and her voice was as clear as the sky which the snow had fallen from. I was not unaware of her intention to appear like the snow and sky while before me. Regardless of whether she knew that I understood her feelings or not, the small troublemaking psychopathic girl said shortly.</p><p>“This young lady hereupon reports, that she has achieved your lordship’s goal. ”</p><p>So much self-pride and smugness could be understood by that&nbsp;shortness of words.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I wanted to compliment this girl. I wanted to acknowledge the hard work she had gone through by staying up throughout the night chasing after senior officers, consoling the new recruits, and doing all of her laundries with her own two hands. I gestured for Farnese to approach and softly brushed the hair of Farnese who had drawn near with an ivory comb.</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>“Well done. Would you like a drink?”</p><p>Ο</p><p>♦</p><p>Ο</p><p>Farnese did not try to gain adoration from her troops. Farnese desired for every individual soldier to fear her. Instead of the courage to rush at the enemy, Farnese highly regarded the dread the soldiers would feel by disobeying the supreme commander. This was, indeed, different compared to me. Unknowledgeable on the method of obtaining fear, Farnese came and asked me.</p><p>“What should this young lady do to make the soldiers fear her, lord?”</p><p>“Well. You do have a rather pretty appearance, so that may be difficult.”</p><p>“Would they be afraid if there was an unseemly scar on this young lady’s face?”</p><p>“Damn it, this ignorant child. How could you think so one-dimensionally? Think a bit more respectably.”</p><p>“Only your lordship and Miss Lazuli are the ones to&nbsp;call this young lady ignorant……”</p><p>Farnese became sullen. As of late, Farnese had been receiving education from both myself and Lapis. Compared to me, Lapis taught her much more harshly. It was obvious that this small room girl, who lived her life believing that she was a genius,&nbsp;would be low-spirited if she were to be ill-treated frequently. Feeling some sympathy, I spoke indirectly.</p><p>“Should I inform you of a good trick?”</p><p>The next day.</p><p>Farnese purchased 15 hunting dogs. The waists of the hunting dogs were slim so they appeared scrawny, but the color of their fur was marvelous. They were a breed commonly raised by imperial families and royal families, so they were remarkably expensive. The dogs did not leave their master’s side even for a second.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— I see Miss General adores dogs.</p><p>— Raising hunting dogs is a good hobby. They can smell the scent of the enemy and pursue them, so it’ll be convenient for us too.</p><p>Ο</p><p>The soldiers gathered in small groups and chewed on dried meat. Though they tossed some of their dried meat for fun, the hunting dogs did not turn their gaze towards it at all.</p><p>Farnese personally acquired food and fed the dogs herself. The dog food looked more luxurious than the food people ate. Some privates joked that Miss General fed the mutts better than them and chuckled. After seeing the sight of Farnese providing a sumptuous meal for the beasts, some people claimed that they were delighted since she finally appeared like a young girl, while others were worried that the commander’s selfish interest would disturb the military order. With half delight and half worry, the soldiers stared at the luxurious dog food with envy.</p><p>The time for my army to go to war had arrived. The troops, who had warm sleep and ate till their stomachs were full, had clear eyes despite the winter season. 3,500 dwarf infantrymen, 500 centaur cavalry, and 50 witches hired from the city were standing on the winter field, waiting for the general’s speech before our departure. There were people gathered around the outskirts of the field, but they were all peddlers and prostitutes. These types of people lived with busy feet by constantly following behind anywhere armies went.</p><div></div><p>“……”</p><p>While holding a formal-dress sword, Farnese went up onto the platform. There was no decoration so the blade was small. Since the appearance of the weapon was light, it well suited the miss’ body figure. The hunting dogs followed their master all the way up the platform. The dogs then silently stationed themselves around her.</p><p>Farnese unsheathed her blade. Hearing the sound of metal, the hunting dogs looked behind them. The clear-blue sword slit the long neck of a dog. Blood burst out. The other dogs did not react at all. Farnese killed all 15 hunting dogs, and until the very end, not a single one barked. Blood soundlessly flowed down from the platform.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—……</p><p>Ο</p><p>The soldiers all held their breaths. They did not dare meet the commander’s gaze.</p><p>People would fear the general who had mercilessly slaughtered the hunting dogs which she had raised so preciously, they would fear the silent general whose face was expressionless during the entire slaughter, and they would also fear the fact that that sort of general was merely a 16-year-old girl. They would especially dread the intentions behind the general who had gone out of her way to slaughter her pets, which she had treated with care, on the day the army was departing. While glancing at the decapitated heads of the dogs rolling around, the captains rubbed their own necks.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Laura De Farnese spoke.</p><p>“Advance.”</p><p>The troops obeyed.</p><p>Ο</p><p>♦</p><p>Ο</p><p>Farnese&nbsp;turned the&nbsp;dead hunting dogs into dried meat. It was a week’s distance from here to the location where the other Demon Lords planned to gather their armies. For one week, Farnese chewed on the jerky made of dog meat and drove away soldiers with her gaze.</p><p>On one of the days, a river was not entirely frozen so we had set up camp at a ferry service to rest. There was a small village located next to the ferry service. I issued a military command and forbade them from pillaging.</p><p>Around the afternoon, three soldiers were caught. They were criminals that had surreptitiously trespassed onto private property to steal from and rape the women and children. At the time I had heard the report, I was enjoying tea in a back room with Farnese and Lapis on both my sides. The tea warmed my insides. Lowering my teacup, I gazed at Farnese.</p><p>“Since you are the general, you decide the punishment.”</p><p>“I wish to execute them.”</p><p>“Execution, huh?”</p><p>After taking a slight glance at Lapis, I turned back to Farnese.</p><p>“Is execution not excessive?”</p><p>“They are people who have disobeyed the military command. Additionally, they are also the first offenders. This punishment will decide how retribution&nbsp;will be carried out within the army from now on. This young lady wishes to handle this with severity.”</p><p>Lapis broke into the conversation and asked quietly.</p><p>“What method of execution will you carry out?”</p><p>“In order to establish an upright&nbsp;regulation within the military,&nbsp;their heads must be severed and put on display. This young lady shall behead them.”</p><p>Lapis asked again.</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“I asked how you planned to do it, miss.”</p><p>“What do you mean by how? Is it not over once their heads are on display?”</p><p>“How pathetic.”</p><p>Farnese’s shoulders twitched because of Lapis’ admonishing words. After the day Lapis had vowed that she would become the&nbsp;mother, she frequently scolded and affronted Farnese ever since. Lapis purposely behaved cruelly like Farnese’s biological father, who had trampled on her childhood, had done. Farnese had trouble dealing with the Lapis who behaved like this.</p><p>“The people are like weeds. They will stand back up no matter how many times they are trampled. Among those weeds, hired soldiers are the most tenacious. The soldiers will not lower themselves just because the heads of three rapists have been cut off. However, that is if you do not certainly implant fear into them beforehand.”</p><p>“Then what does this young lady……”</p><p>“Think of that on your own. Is the object&nbsp;attached to the miss’ shoulders not a head but a tin bucket? Why are you unable to think on your own and coming to me for help?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“If you are truly the general, then there is no need to confide in me or his highness. Previously, you relied on his highness in order to buy the soldiers’ fears, and you are now trying to purchase the soldiers’ dread by confiding in me. You will one day have to repay the debt that you have borrowed from his highness and myself, and the name of that price will be nothing less than your incompetence. If one were to count the number of times you had borrowed the hands of others from here and there, then the amount of competence which you lack will surely be immense. Miss, I do not wish for the misfortune&nbsp;of the debt you had piled up due to your own lack of skill, being repaid by his highness instead.”</p><p>Farnese became silent.</p><p>I did not get in between these two. If I were to interfere now, then Lapis would be ashamed and Farnese would feel humiliated. In order to allow&nbsp;my two vassals to exchange with one another and, in their own way, establish a distance, I stayed silent.</p><p>After contemplating for a long period of time, Farnese muttered.</p><p>“This young lady will personally take the sword and cut down the criminals to……”</p><p><em>Slap</em></p><p>Farnese lowered her head.</p><p>The cheek which&nbsp;was hit had become red.</p><p>Lapis spoke.</p><p>“Answer again.”</p><p>“……I do not know. Miss Lazuli. This young lady does not have the faintest idea.”</p><p>Lapis struck the other party’s cheek with more power than before. Farnese cowered. She became miserable like a crinkled wrap of aluminum.</p><p>“You did not know from the very beginning. Despite that, you made up a response and hoped that it would coincidentally be the answer. If you were to confess from the start that you did not know, then you would not have been hit, and if you were to have maintained the attitude of trying to figure out the answer until the very end, then the occasion of you being hit would have been non-existent during this time as well. Your dishonesty represents your petty self-pride and your lack of effort represents your incompetence. With what face is a person who is both petty and incompetent sitting here comfortably? Leave immediately.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Farnese was chased out of the room.</p><p>In the room where only Lapis and I remained, it became silent.</p><p>“……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>We poured each other tea. We observed the sight of milky-white steam rising up from our teacups.</p><p>Even if more tea were to pile on top of itself, the tea remained transparent and did not become cloudy.&nbsp;Tea with a slight tint of color was more transparent than plain water with absolutely no color. Transparency was obvious in something that started off with no color, but for something to have color and be transparent enough to see the bottom of at the same time, was both clean and divine. We desired to educate Farnese like this tea. Lapis and I did not consider the act of turning Farnese into plain water or leaving her as so, as education. We regarded the process of cutting, grinding, brewing the tea leaves, and then finally pouring the brew into the teacup, to be education. If I bestowed color to our daughter and Lapis brewed her, then&nbsp;Farnese&nbsp;would naturally bear a fragrance and emit it on her own. It was an artificiality that processed nature, and it was an artificiality that uncovered nature as well. We did not treat someone who had their thirst for authority castrated and tossed away as an adult, and we did not respect a child who did not know how to handle their authority. We were cold people.</p><p>After raising the cup before me and placing it on my lips, the tea was already cool. While drinking that cold tea, the two of us spoke to one another in a low voice.</p><p>“How would your highness have dealt with the rapists?”</p><p>“Mm. The main point of this issue is providing the fear of punishment to the soldiers. The more distinct the punishment is will make it stronger, and the more obscure the dread is will make it more powerful. It must be clear-cut on one side while giving a feeling of uncertainty on the other. That is the best solution.”</p><p>Lapis nodded.</p><p>“A logical response.”</p><p>“If it were me, then I would have castrated the genitals of the criminals and pierced a hole in the spot where their genitals once were. After that, I would bring an untamed orc or goblin and make them violate that hole. With this, the point becomes clear that rapists will receive rape in return, and the soldiers will feel fear by the aspect of a hole being created by force and having said hole be violated. Therefore, the troops will feel the dread of penalty all the way to the inside of their skulls.”</p><p>Lapis nodded her head once more.</p><p>“That is remarkable. Except, it would be more outstanding if you were to also carve their eyes out and insert their testicles into those empty sockets. That way,&nbsp;you could include the metaphor which warns them to not commit a crime while blinded by lust.”</p><p>“A splendid idea.”</p><p>It was my turn to nod this time.</p><p>“Since the metaphor envelops the distinctiveness and obscurity, the penalty will be even more apparent. Furthermore, you won’t be throwing away the severed testicles, and will be recycling them instead, so that makes it more beautiful.”</p><p>It was a tacit&nbsp;understanding. The two of us had no reason to not love each other. I understood that the term ‘a match made in heaven’ was not an exaggeration after having met Lapis.</p><p>“With how much points does your highness assume the miss will solve this task?”</p><p>“I wonder. I feel like she will narrowly fill 30 points.”</p><p>“Your highness is generous. This one is predicting 20 points. This one still does not understand why your highness has such a favorable opinion of the miss. Whether she truly does have talent or not, this one is unable to judge it as so.”</p><p>“She does indeed have an ignorant side to her……”</p><p>I smiled bitterly.</p><p>Regardless, our assessment was purely limited to the domain of politics. The realm of tactics was something entirely&nbsp;different. Our aptitude for the art of war was either completely non-existent or incredibly minimal. Even Lapis should have slightly realized by now that Farnese was a genius in regards to tactics.</p><p>“A terrifying monster lives over the mountains and in the land of humans. Farnese is the sword to defeat that monster.”</p><p>“……Puzzles are not this one’s specialty. A monster? Just what kind of person is he for your highness to refer to him as a monster?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>I gulped down the rest of my tea.</p><p>“That is incorrect. It is a she.”</p><p>The ringleader to exterminate the Demon Lords within 30 years.</p><p>In this world lied a girl who would hire a humble sword wielding farmer from a slash-and-burn village, and then proceed to send that villager out as the vanguard of war with the title of ‘hero’. In this world lied a girl who would crush enemies who persisted, dust away enemies who yielded, and pull back enemies who fled and tossed them aside. If there was a cruel person who did not change one’s manners after killing nobles or feel sympathy after slaughtering their own subjects, then there was also an empress who would annihilate all of the Demon Lords and establish a united empire.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Therefore.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Do you know how this world ends?</p><p>Ο</p><p>As the result of all the Demon Lords disappearing, all magical energy in the world will lose its current and cause it to overflow, until finally, it results in the collapse of the world. The mastermind to be the first person to open the doors to a unified continent while also being the first person to destroy the world at the same time, was currently living in this world as a young imperial princess.</p><p>Elizabeth.</p><p>Elizabeth A. E. von Habsburg.</p><p>In order to face her, Farnese was essential. If the imperial princess possessed the sword known as the hero, then I possessed the blade known as Farnese. I carefully savored the taste of the tea in my mouth.</p><p>Grow quickly, Farnese.</p><p>Hurry and mature, oh Farnese.</p><p>We are living in order to not die.</p><p>Ο</p><p>♦</p><p>Ο</p><p>One hour later, the execution was carried out.</p><p>Farnese had made a hole in the ice on top of the river. The three culprits were dropped into that hole. However, they were not submerged completely but only to the point where the water reached their chins. The miss ordered the witches to refreeze the river. The offenders’ bodies were then completely trapped in the ice water with only their heads sticking out. Farnese bent her back and met their gaze.</p><p>“They say that an old monster lurks in this river. Do well to endure.”</p><p>The faces of the culprits became deathly pale.</p><p>The fiends living in the water swam towards the men. The shadows of beasts stirring underneath the platform of ice could be seen.</p><p>The offenders screamed and flailed, and at the same time of their rigorous movement, the monsters rushed at their lower bodies and began tearing it apart.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Please spare us!</p><p>— We apologize, oh great general! I plead you!</p><p>Ο</p><p>Little by little.</p><p>Underneath the ice water, the beasts ate away at the men’s flesh a small portion at a time. The monsters ripped the feet of the criminals with their teeth, tore the flesh on their waist, and gnawed away at their lungs. As time passed, the screaming weakened. A stillness fell over the surrounding. The thousands of soldiers who were watching the execution were silent. Only the heads of the criminals remained above the ice, while below the platform of ice, a crimson color spread out and dyed the water.</p><p>Farnese glanced down at the sight of blood spreading below her feet.</p><p>She then lifted up the heads of the culprits. Since their bodies were already completely torn apart from their heads, their heads came off from the ice with ease. Farnese examined the faces which were frozen in a pained expression and muttered like a judge who was grading the work of a 3rd rate painter.</p><p>“This is not appealing. The shape of their heads is unsatisfying.”</p><p>Farnese tossed the heads to the captains.</p><p>“Hang them up.”</p><p>The heads of the criminals were impaled onto rods and put on display in the center of the village. The word ‘Rapists’ was carved into their faces with a knife. Blood trailed down the&nbsp;blade mark. In the middle of that night, the cold became so severe that the blood drops froze.</p><p>The next day, the soldiers put the severed heads behind them and crossed over the sheet of ice. While stepping over the ice, the soldiers frequently glanced down below their feet. It seemed the thought of the decapitated heads was still being harbored in their minds respectively. After that day, there were no more soldiers who went against the military order.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the troops, Lapis and I made an assessment.</p><p>“See? 30 points.”</p><p>“It appears like 20 points to this one.”</p><p>Farnese only chose one option in the fear of penalty. There was no preciseness in the punishment and&nbsp;only obscure dread was filled to the brim. Since it was only filled with ambiguity, punishment had no form, and without a form, it was unable to exist by itself.</p><p>Farnese’s punishment could not reach as far as punitive measures. Now, the officers would only fear the Farnese who had enacted punishment. Like a child who was afraid of their parents. Whether it be a person of authority trying to manage politics with fear, or a parent attempting to break in their child with dread, these were common mistakes committed by people. It was not a surprise that a horrible parent was also a terrible person of authority. I scoffed at the individuals who tried to properly run a country when they were unable to manage their own household early on despite using the method of Confucius and Mencius.</p><p>Lapis let out a sigh.</p><p>“Your highness, this one is frustrated. At this rate, she will be unable to grasp a single thing even if 5 years were to pass.”</p><p>“What do you suggest?”</p><p>“This one shall remodel her from the root. If the miss is unable to grasp logic herself, then should we not inject reason into her ourselves?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Lapis’ eyes were glowing coldly.</p><p>—Rote learning was born here in this moment.</p><p>Lapis educated Farnese more strongly.</p><p>In an area out the sight of the soldiers, Lapis hit and trained Farnese. Lapis did not have the tendency of complimenting the other party. Without any praise, she taught Farnese how to not lower her head, how to not stutter her words, how to not dishevel her facial expressions, how to not slouch her back, and how to not ruin her gait. Lapis spoke quietly.</p><p>“Look straight. Speak straight. Walk straight.”</p><p>Farnese learned while being hit. After being beaten for 4 days, was when Farnese was barely able to prepare a single speech. Lapis had also taught her how to properly angle her gaze, where to direct her stride, and where to stress her words. Finally, while in front of the gaze of the soldiers, Farnese gave a speech.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Conserve your courage. Do not try to charge in courageously whenever possible. Conserve your mercy. Do not try to bestow mercy to others whenever you desire. Conserve your lust. Do not try to grab and rape a broad or lad whenever you crave it. The courage you have when fighting alongside your colleagues is not bravery. The mercy you hand to our enemies is not benevolence. The lust&nbsp;you release to your companion is not craving. This major general despises soldiers who act courageously when they should not, show mercy when they should not, and rape when they should not.</p><p>— This general desires for the courage of you gentlemen to be used solely for taking the necks of the enemy, for your mercy to be used solely for forgiving your colleagues, and for your lust to be used solely for taking the families of the enemy. Hold your courage, save your mercy, conserve your lust, and devote your terror and dread to this general. In return, you shall all receive&nbsp;the terror and dread from every foe in the world as tribute.</p><p>Ο</p><p>The soldiers cheered.</p><p>Only the soldiers cheered.</p><p>After the speech was over, Lapis gave an evaluation.</p><p>“30 points. Put in the effort to be able to improvise that level of speech from now on.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Farnese turned to look at me. Her face was still emotionless, and yet, for some reason, a desire for redemption could be felt from her eyes.</p><p>“Lord……”</p><p>I smiled brightly.</p><p>“10 points. It was a pathetic speech. Be hit more.”</p><p>“Even your lordshiiip……”</p><p>Farnese fell to her knees on top of the snow.</p><p>Farnese was most likely unaware of the fact that in the areas where she was not, Lapis and I discussed the miss’ education methods throughout the night.</p><p>We are a bit of an excessive couple, my daughter.</p><p>Be it for a good reason or bad, Farnese was experiencing growth befitting the general of a Demon Lord.</p><p>The soldiers following Farnese were completely becoming the Demon Lord’s army.</p><p>Miss Farnese reigned over the military as the general, I took care of the army as the monarch, and Lapis supported the military camps as the adviser. Miss Farnese led the soldiers with&nbsp;terror at the front, I held the soldiers together with benevolence at the center, and Lapis put the soldiers at&nbsp;ease with thoroughness at the back, that was our state of affairs. There was no gap between the three of us. We gained merit from each other respectively and interlocked firmly like the characters 凹凸. Strategy–Personnel Administration–Logistic Command breathed together as one body.</p><p>Among these, if we were to talk about Lapis, who was handling the logistic command, she was mostly following at the very rear of our march while leading the material supplies. At the back of our army, there were not only wagons, but peddlers, panders, and prostitutes crawling around. It was Lapis’ duty to supervise and manage the rights of these people.</p><p>She was&nbsp;heartless.</p><p>The lover who was cold-blooded to me and cruel to Farnese was what kind of person Lapis Lazuli was. There was no chance that that kind of Lapis would take care of the peddlers generously.</p><p>By the time Farnese had executed 2 soldiers, Lapis had already beheaded 20 peddlers. Lapis did not forgive the people who disturbed the trading area. She gruesomely punished&nbsp;anyone who committed the conduct of scamming the soldiers. Lapis determined the severity of the punishment by the crime committed, and carried out the punitive action on the same day the verdict was decided.</p><p>Lapis’ ruling was always short.</p><p>“Slit your throat.”</p><p>“Sever your limbs.”</p><p>“Cut open your stomach and display your internal organs.”</p><p>“Be buried.”</p><p>The verdicts were easy to understand and had no room for misinterpretation.</p><p>The horrifying truth was that&nbsp;<strong>the method of punishment was solely execution</strong>.</p><p>Execution by beheading was somewhat on the merciful side. The breaking wheel was the second best option after beheading. The slightest bit of one’s dignity was at least preserved up to this point.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>You could at least look at the corpse and say, ‘So this guy was a goblin’, or, ‘So that guy was an orc’, by identifying the shape of their body.</p><p>However, whether it be skinning alive the procurers who treated their prostitutes like slaves and stole their pay, or ripping out the internal organs of peddlers like a&nbsp;bunch of noodles for unfairly gaining profit from soldiers who were lacking in the head, there was no dignity here whatsoever. There were only blood red entrails.</p><p>Lapis was cold-hearted.</p><p>If there was a single mistake on the directory then someone would, without a doubt, die on that day. Even if the numbers matched the list, as a person whose previous job was a merchant, she noticed the deception and made certain to kill the one responsible. It was impossible to fool Lapis who used to be a peasant that had risen up to be an executive in the Keuncuska Firm.</p><p>Since the soldiers at the front were afraid of General Farnese, and the suppliers at the back were terrified of Lapis’ punishments, both the front and rear of our forces were tranquil.</p><p>The voices of people disregarding Miss Farnese by claiming that she was a human harlot, disappeared. And the scornful words which spoke ill of Lapis by calling her a vulgar half-breed peasant&nbsp;had also vanished.</p><p>All I had to do was stay idle.</p><p>Even if I messed around, the march of my army progressed with no issue.</p><p>While our journey went on for a week, the captains uttered in surprise that it was the first time in their lives to&nbsp;experience such an easy march. Normally,&nbsp;an army would lose energy the further they went and their aim would weaken, but his highness’ army gathered strength the more we walked and our goal became clearer, so they were able to understand what the term Royal Grace truly meant because of this, was what the captains stated.</p><p>I, who was actually comfortably doing nothing, nodded my head in response. All I had to do was give their wages on time, occasionally punish the ones who embezzled the money, and the soldiers would cry out, ‘Hooray for his highness Demon Lord!’, on their own. Farnese and Lapis were the ones’ doing the hard work, but I had the&nbsp;monopoly of all the praises.</p><p>Referentially, this is the method of winning in life.</p><p>Bonjour—.</p><p>And like that, a week past.</p><p>An open field was spread out before us.</p><p>With a ‘clang, clang’, the sound of a frozen brook being broken resonated. Soldiers were holding tools and pounding on the ice. Past the men, a countless amount of tents were lined up.</p><p>The stream flowed for a distance before our vision of it was blocked by tents. It continued flowing while in its hidden state and came out in a whimsical place somewhere else to continue flowing. At every spot the brook came out, 10 goblins were attached and were smashing away at the ice. This scenery extended out all the way to the horizon.</p><p>Farnese examined the horizon with her eyes.</p><p>“Approximately a massive army of 60,000……”</p><p>The dark blue skin of orcs, the green wrinkled skin of goblins, and the sturdy gray skin of trolls crowded the military encampment. It was swarming with color. All kinds of miscellaneous things were mixed together and squirming around like an ant’s nest. Those fellows had set up their own world over there.</p><p>It was a world that I didn’t really want to squeeze into. I wished to decline politely. I was a bit too young to accept something that was being crowded, being swarmed, and squirming as beautiful.</p><p>“Would it truly be 60,000? Those goblins over there are not wearing clothes so they are most likely servants and not troops. This is worrying……”</p><p>“What are you concerned about, lord?”</p><p>“Since they have freely mixed the soldiers who fight with the servants who aid, there is no possibility that their military discipline will be stern. I fear that the number of soldiers may appear many, but that, in truth, their worth does not match their quantity.”</p><p>While staring at the lineup of the Demon Lord Allied Forces, which had gathered here to suppress the humans, Farnese spoke. It seemed she was overwhelmed by the number of tents covering the field.</p><p>“But is it still not a grand spectacle?”</p><p>“Quite.”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“This magnificent view is indeed grand.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>2nd month and 12th day.</p><p>We arrived at the promised field.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><hr><p>TL Note: I swear&nbsp;if someone says they’re dropping the series cause of the dog scene.</p><p>Anyway, I should clear something up that isn’t distinctly explained. Some people might think that the dog killing wouldn’t possibly have that much of an impact on the troops because of how quick it was, but if you pay attention to the time frame, Laura was in possession of the dogs for about a full month. The Walpurgis Night from the previous chapter ended on Dec 7th. If this chapter started right after that was over, then Laura got rid of the irraionality in the troops by Jan 7th, 30 days after. She then went into obtaining fear, which was getting the dogs, and the dispatch day was Feb 5th, 7 days before they arrived at the field. So in my opinion, 1 month seems like a decent amount of time. But that could just be me. And besides, you can just be optimistic if you want, and say those dogs were really old, so they were going to be put down soon anyway. That way, it’d mean that Farnese gave them a cause before they met their fate. What a kind girl… (Dantalian will most likely laugh at this optimism)</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Before ending this TL note, here’s a note for some of the readers who seem to always be confused.&nbsp;<strong>Don’t skim Dungeon Defense.</strong>&nbsp;A lot of the things that people ask or criticize the story about is answered if you read the story properly.

The soldiers gathered in twos and whispered among one another  that the saintess had been possessed by an evil spirit. The fear on the  soldiers’ faces was apparent.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Black smoke shall engulf the mountains. It shall swallow the empire  and, at last, consume the entire continent. The gray clouds shall have  no limits or bounds, and thus, the winter shall continue with no limits  or bounds. Freeze in this continuous winter. Everything shall freeze.  The black smoke shall not clear. The black shall……</p><p>Ο</p><p>Speaking up to that point, the saintess then vomited blood. The blood  was sticky because of the content that was mixed together with her  blood. The reason I was able to detail this incident so confidently was  because I was there in person to hear the prophecy during the previous  night.</p><p>As I was the commander in charge of the northern region, I  participated in the conference for the highest leading members of the  government. We had received information that the Demon Lord Allied  Forces were going to invade soon. We had to prepare against the  invasion. I was not the sole person to partake in the strategy meeting,  but the authority figures, His Highness the Crown Prince and Her  Highness the Imperial Princess, and adding to that, The Saintess, were  present as well. In that location, the Saintess was possessed by a  spirit.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— The black shall, the black shall, the black shall……</p><p>Ο</p><p>The saintess coughed blood. She vomited repetitively. Her eyes rolled  up to the back of her head and revealed the whites of her eyes. There  were many clumps from her intestines mixed into her blood. The saintess  convulsed. We urgently called for the clerics and healed her.</p><p>The Imperial Princess made an entreaty.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— This incident is confidential. Only we must know of this. Do not  divulge this information outside. If the soldiers were to hear the  saintess’ prophecy, then they will be heavily shaken, thus meaning, we  cannot allow our morale to drop in our current situation where the Demon  Lords plan to invade. No matter what cost, watch your words.</p><p>Ο</p><p>I agreed.</p><p>The Crown Prince, while consumed by fear, nodded his head as well.</p><p>With that, the case was supposed to be buried, but—for some reason,  not a day had passed before the prophecy ended up being leaked. At the  entire front, at that.</p><p>From the veteran officers to the new recruits, they all knew of the  news that the saintess had vomited pitch black blood last night. Even  the peddlers at the bottom of the military camp knew the contents of the  prophecy. People whispered that it was an ominous omen.</p><p>Throughout the night, I wandered through the crowds and reprimanded  the captains. There was nothing more terrifying than a wild rumor.  Nothing more horrifying than the sound of words. Since soldiers lose and  injure their lives effortlessly, they felt fear and dread just as  easily. That is the core of a soldier. Since I have lived for more than  60 years now, I have seen many occasions of an army falling apart due to  a groundless rumor. There was nothing which assured that it would not  happen this time as well.</p><p>I wished to decline being defeated before even engaging with the  Demon Lord Allied Forces. Measures must most likely be discussed  immediately. Above all else, I cannot fall until I have avenged myself  for the humiliation I suffered last autumn……</p><p>“Your Highness the Imperial Princess, I am here on this morning to pay my respects.”</p><p>“Enter.”</p><p>The Imperial Princess spent her time enclosed by a white tent. She  disliked going under a roof to sleep. The Imperial Princess declared  that if the troops were being struck by snow and rain, and if one  was unable to prevent the fall of that snow and rain, then it should not  be avoided. The soldiers held that Imperial Princess in high esteem,  and worried for the Imperial Princess’ health foremost when it rained or  snowed.</p><p>……Of course, the Imperial Princess’ action was most likely a  political scheme, but the majority of nobles were unable to properly  carry out even this simple ploy. Separate to the Imperial Princess’  personality, I respected her ability.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Pushing the white cloth to the side, I became surprised by the sight of the Imperial Princess.</p><p>And the scene that was utterly unexpected.</p><p>Inside the tent, a long table was placed.</p><p>This was fine.</p><p>That was a normal scene.</p><p>But if there was a corpse of an alligator spread out on top of the  table, and additionally, if the Imperial Princess was personally holding  a knife and butchering that alligator, then the scenery went a thousand  miles from being normal.</p><p>“For the margrave to come pay his respects. What a rare occasion.”</p><p>The Imperial Princess silently stripped the skin off the gator.</p><p>She did not glance towards my direction even once.</p><p>“Did you not dislike me?”</p><p>“Nothing of the sort, your highness. This general has always respected your highness.”</p><p>“That isn’t a lie. Not a lie. However, you also do not revere me. Is that not so?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“You respect me. However, occasionally the word ‘respect’ is nothing  more than a slightly safer and milder way to pronounce the word ‘scorn’.  Words are trivial.”</p><p><em>Thack</em></p><p>The Imperial Princess shaved a piece of fragrant wood and scattered  it into a brass incense burner. The brass, heated by a charcoal fire,  slowly lit the chunks of wood aflame. The aromatic wood burned. As smoke  formed, the fragrance spread. The aroma covered the smell of the  alligator’s blood. While hiding the scent of blood, the fragrant smoke  rose up densely. The fragrance seeped all the way down to my gut.</p><p><em>Thuck</em></p><p>The Imperial Princess skinned the alligator within the smoke.</p><p>The Imperial Princess peeled the skin by severing the outer layer of  muscle and stabbing into the inner layer of muscle. The boundary of the  outer and inner layer was clearly visible to the princess. I  unintentionally marveled at the skillful hand movement that was able to  establish a border in the flesh and carved that boundary out naturally  like a professional butcher. I could not imagine when and where the  lady, who was born into the highest lineage in the world, had learned  how to skin an alligator. The Imperial Princess, who resembled the  secluded place in which she was born and raised in, was difficult to  handle.</p><p>“Do you not think that the majority of the conversations we have  shared can be condensed into more simple terms? I like you. I hate you. A  person’s mind may start from there, but they are unable to arrive at  this location in the end. Although people may refer to this as the path  or course of life, I honestly call it a waste of time. Sir Rosenberg.  Let us not waste each other’s time. Why did you come find me despite  your animosity towards me? Tell me the reason why I have to listen to  the words of a man, who does not revere me, while it is still noon.”</p><p><img data-attachment-id=\"26871\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2016/09/13/dungeon-defense-volume-3-chapter-2-part-2/dunde-volume3-page129/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dunde-volume3-page129.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"819,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"dunde-volume3-page129\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dunde-volume3-page129.jpg?w=205\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dunde-volume3-page129.jpg?w=700\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dunde-volume3-page129.jpg?w=700\" alt=\"dunde-volume3-page129\"></p><p>Was it a threat? Or was she serious?</p><p>I was unable to figure out the emotions of the other party. There  were no expressions on her face. It appeared as if she was purely  focused on the task of skinning the alligator. Even though the Imperial  Princess was outside, it felt as if she was still residing within the  palace. It even felt like she was the palace. If the amount of nobility  she had purged did not reach over the dozens—then I may have had already  been deceived by her outer appearance by this point.</p><p>“Your highness. You cannot gain the admiration of nobility automatically.”</p><p>“Oh dear. I do not desire for your admiration.”</p><p>The Imperial Princess shed her feelings and laughed.</p><p>It was a sound of laughter with no temperature.</p><p>“I was merely asking what meaning your respect has. The word respect  contains 5 different meanings and 10 variations of tone. That is why I  do not trust words. What I demand from you is not words, but actions.  Distinct-Evident-Articulate-actions. Of course, you would not listen  even if I were to order you to like this. You are a stubborn old man,  after all.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“……”</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>“……Information that Demon Lord Barbatos, Demon Lord Marbas, and Demon  Lord Paimon, as the key individuals, are calling together an army has  arrived. Although the total military strength is uncertain, it is clear  that they have more than 50,000 but less than 70,000.”</p><p>“It seems it is not as fearsome as I had imagined. They do not have  Baal nor do they have Agares. Barbatos is ignorant, Marbas is  indecisive, and Paimon is…… well, Paimon.”</p><p>“Your highness is currently underestimating the enemy forces.”</p><p>“That is not so.”</p><p>At that moment, the Imperial Princess looked at me for the first time.</p><p>My mind felt needlessly restless because her purple eyes felt like they could pierce through a person’s psyche.</p><p>“No. Oh dear, by the Gods. That is not so at all! Why would I  possibly underestimate the enemy forces? Never in my life have I ever  devaluated someone.”</p><p>“Is that the case?”</p><p>“Of course. As proof of that, you are still alive.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“You are a man of talent that is essential to our empire. The House  of Rosenberg has been loyal to the imperial family for the past 500  years. And they have protected us from the invasions of the Demon Lords  coming from the Black Mountains for 1,000 years. You are a competent  individual, Georg. I respect you. If perhaps, I did not respect you,  then—something like a province warlord in command of troops could not  possibly still exist, is that not so?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“This is what it means to show one’s purpose through actions. It is  distinct, evident, and articulate. Georg, I at times ponder how  outstanding it would be if people lived without ever using words.”</p><p><em>Rip</em></p><p>The muscle was torn.</p><p>The Imperial Princess plunged her knife into the neck region of the  gator. The neck was more tender than any other area on an alligator’s  body. Once the Imperial Princess moved her blade, the leather on the  neck was skinned off just like that.</p><p>“It is fortunate that that situation is not now. Be at ease and continue. My ears are prepared to listen courteously.”</p><p>“If the Demon Lords are going to invade, then they must choose one of  three paths. The first path is the passage in the mountains……”</p><p>“A passage that leads to the Kingdom of Teuton. That has no relation to us.”</p><p>“……The second path is through the plains.”</p><p>“The path to the Polish-Lithuanian Kingdom. That certainly does not  matter to our empire as well. For goodness’ sake, we’ll have to pray for  the Gods to influence the Demon Lord armies to go towards the mountains  or plains. We’ll be able to catch our breaths while they are going to  war, after all.”</p><p><em>(TL note: Politunia has been changed to Polish-Lithuanian)</em></p><p>“Your highness.”</p><p>I furrowed my brows.</p><p>I could not stand that sort of response.</p><p>“I apologize, but if this general is correct, they are the same humans as us.”</p><p>“And there are no other animals that can kill humans as efficiently  as other humans. Sir Rosenberg, please stop trying to act refined on  your own!”</p><p>The Imperial Princess gave a timid laugh.</p><p>“Exactly how many villagers have burned to death on the mountains this winter? 100? 200?”</p><p>I closed my mouth.</p><p>“Or was it 300? I’ve heard that the number effortlessly surpasses  1,000, and if my memory serves me right, those villagers were also the  same humans as we are. What did our great Sir Rosenberg do while  thousands of villagers were massacred as humans? You observed. You only  watched.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Do you not consider the word ‘observed’ to be the same term as ‘fire  watching’, but expressed in a more elegant manner? Oh, Northern  Guardian, One of the Four Margraves, the Controller of both the Black  and White Fortresses—Sir von Rosenberg.”</p><p>I stared at the eye of the gator. Since my head was lowered, I could  not meet the eyes of the Imperial Princess. Instead, I intended to at  least glare at the beast.</p><p>The Imperial Princess let words flow out.</p><p>“It seems I have mocked you severely. I apologize. I am apologizing  for the fact that I do not feel particularly sorry. Continue to keep  that in mind.”</p><p>“……I shall bear that in mind.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p><em>Riiiip</em></p><p>The Imperial Princess gripped the back skin of the gator and tore it  off. The leather came off instantly. The skin smoothly peeled off  following the line which she had lacerated earlier. Once the leather was  gone, a light pink inner-flesh was revealed. The color of alligator  meat was modest and light.</p><p>“Do not concern yourself with the passage in the mountains or the  path in the plains. All we have to do is defend the path leading to the  empire. Do you require the assistance of the imperial family?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“The North does not require help from anyone.”</p><p>I responded as clearly as possible.</p><p>“But I shall express my gratitude to your highness’ offer to help.”</p><p>“Oh dear, it seems he’s become upset because of my teasing…… It is  only your loss if a beautifully aged man like yourself were to lose your  temper towards this shameful girl. Just obediently accept the  reinforcements.”</p><p>“I apologize, but your highness, I truly do not require  reinforcements. This one shall defend the mountains, so your highness  should solidify the home front alongside His Highness the Crown Prince.  That way, if we are forced to, we will be able to make contact with  either Teuton or Polish-Lithuania and spread out a strategy.”</p><p>“With my brother? You sure know how to make me laugh.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Do you see that fellow as someone who knows how to manage military  affairs? He is a man who is unable to properly conduct his own mouth and  bottom. Did you not see it as well? I warned everyone to remain silent  about the saintess’ prophecy to such a degree, and yet, the rumor spread  within a single night.”</p><p>“Your grace is immeasurable, your highness”</p><p>The Imperial Princess closed her mouth. I was unable to grasp why she  had shut her mouth. Shortly after, the Imperial Princess spoke again.</p><p>“My brother’s mouth is more loose than a whore’s bottom hole. Even  the privates do not respect my brother. Are you telling me to gather an  army with that sort of man?”</p><p>“……For this general, the Crown Prince is an equal commander. His  Majesty the Emperor ordered this general to manage the north, and did  not treat the Crown Prince any differently there.”</p><p>“Forsooth, it seems you are loyal to my father, the king. I  understand. I respect your loyalty. ……But by the way, Margrave, do you  not think that the term filial piety shines the brightest when dutiful  towards a parent with no worth, and the word loyalty shines brighter  when faithful to a lord with no value? Your loyalty to the emperor is  quite marvelous. It is impressive.”</p><p>The Imperial Princess stabbed the knife into the table.</p><p>With a washcloth, the Imperial Princess cleaned her blood soaked  hands. Once she had done so, she lightly patted my shoulder. The  Imperial Princess’ face was far, but her voice almost felt as if it was  being whispered directly into my ear.</p><p>“You are a loyalist, Sir Rosenberg.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“But you cannot buy my respect with fidelity. If you wish for me to  respect you, then over all else, you must obtain victory. Although I may  be accepting the military orders since you are the supreme commander of  this upcoming war, if by some small chance, you were to commit a  mistake…… Well, I’ll most likely be very disappointed, will I not?”</p><p>“This general shall not bestow disappointment.”</p><p>“I shall trust you.”</p><p>And the Imperial Princess spoke the words.</p><p>“Habsburg grants their faith a single time.”</p><p>“The North shall not forget.”</p><p>The two of us exchanged the maxim passed down in our families from  the House of Habsburg and the House of Rosenberg respectively. The very  act of exchanging the mottoes which were passed down for nearly 1,000  years was sacred. The vow of the Imperial Princess, who appeared like  the one person who would not place her trust in others the most, felt  that much more substantial. The moment I break that single faith, she  will purge me without a doubt……</p><p>The Imperial Princess stabbed the alligator skin onto a rod and raised it up in the center of the military camp.</p><p>Alligators are known as the descendants of dragons. Dragons are the  symbol of Demon Lords. While staring up at the gator skin, the soldiers  whispered among one another that that monster was caught by Her Highness  the Imperial Princess personally.</p><p>After examining that the signs of the soldiers still being afraid had  disappeared, I thought about the armies of the Demon Lords that were  approaching from over the mountains. Whether they will be a strong army  or a rabble, and what fate they were going to bring with them, it was  difficult to make an assumption. Like the Imperial Princess whose face  was hidden by the smoke, the armies of the Demon Lords were similarly  hidden by the mountains, and yet, I was unable to judge whether I should  be afraid of the thing which could not be seen despite being by my  side, or if I should fear the thing that could not be seen because of  the distance. Surrounded by the fear from behind and dread in front, my  body languished.</p><p>I beheaded the two military personnel responsible for circulating the wild rumor among the troops and hung their heads.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian\n<div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 2, Day 12</p><p> Yotvingian Plains, Demon Lord Allied Forces Garrison</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>— Where are those vulgar people crawling from?</p><p>— Ah, don’t you know?

For example, words similar to  ‘universe’ were too antiquated for me to use. I preferred the world  over the universe. If you were a refined individual with common sense,  then by distinguishing a dead language and a contemporary language, you  must at times revitalize a half-dead language, and at other times, beat a  half-dead language to death.</p><p>With no room for debate, I was a splendidly refined individual.  Therefore, I elegantly expressed the word rabble in a bit more fresh  language.</p><p>The Demon Lord Allied Forces were a bunch of damned pieces of shit.</p><p>As soon as we entered through the camp gate with our banners held out  in front of us, for some reason, soldiers who were pitiable like bums  approached us and spoke nonsense.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Your Honor Dantalian! To bring a human bitch in front of us humble  fellows who are gathered here to suppress the humans, we are able to  understand your honor’s immeasurable motive. If your honor has had  enough fun with that harlot, then please allow us lowly ones to have a  taste as well!</p><p>— That human harlot’s presence is dignified, so her being the  imperator is evident. If she’s so robust during the day, then just  imagining how boyish she’d be during the night is putting me at a loss.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Looking at the soldiers blocking our path, I let out a sigh.</p><p>Seeing that they were coming at me without any fear, it was clear  that they were the subordinates of a Demon Lord of a much higher rank  than myself. To the demons, the humans were the enemy of our kind, and  their social status was considered as peasants. To them, for a Demon  Lord like myself to make a human like Farnese into my acting general was  definitely a mistake. I rebuked them moderately.</p><p>“It seems you fools have lost your minds. Move aside before your  balls are removed and shoved into your mouths. Or in reverse, do you  want your throats to be slit and your dicks shoved in there?”</p><p>The soldiers laughed loudly.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— For your honor to say that you will personally jack us off. We are so gracious that we do not know where to place our bodies.</p><p>Ο</p><p>The crowd split in half, and thus our path was finally open.</p><p>Commanding Lapis and Farnese to move to my side, the three of us  moved forward with the heads of our horses aligned next to one another.  Lapis quietly spoke in a tone that only I could hear.</p><p>“You did well to endure, your highness.”</p><p>“What do I have to endure? You are the ones to have received the ridicule, so you two did well holding back.”</p><p>“What could your highness be talking about? This one is later on  going to take the lives of those soldiers in secret, so your highness  did well in enduring right this moment. The insult this one has received  will, of course, be repaid by this one.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Those soldiers were piteous. I still vividly remembered the method  where a certain maid was poisoned to death for having insulted Lapis.  These fellows should be happy if their corpses were at least left  intact.</p><p>Farnese muttered.</p><p>“This young lady cannot understand. Why does every officer who looks  at this young lady wrongly assume that this young lady had slept with  your lordship? Thinking logically, there is no chance that a man like  your lordship could possibly be allowed in this young lady’s bed.”</p><p>“Take the situation more seriously, you idiot.”</p><p>I’m not sure whether it’s because this child had always shut herself  in a library to read history books all day, but she didn’t have the  sensibility to accept reality.</p><p>Leading my vassals, who I could not say had a strong distinct  characteristic since they actually had nothing but distinct  characteristics, we went into the deepest part of the encampment. The  demon soldiers poured jeers on us by shouting ‘Boo— boo—’. They called  me ‘The King of Peasants’, Lapis as ‘The King’s Whore’, and Farnese was  referred to as ‘The King’s Slave’. It felt like we had all of a sudden  become a popular idol group.</p><p>How poignant.</p><p>For them as well, every day was shit, thus their lives should have  been spent enduring this kind of days, and yet instead, they scorned  peasants and slaves. They most likely suffered because of the nobles and  were pressured to look down, and the only thing below them were  peasants and slaves. It became a state of affairs where the things they  received from the nobles were passed straight down to the people below  them. What could possibly console them? Was there anything more to say  to the reasonability of these low people, who could not gather together,  but fought among each other instead? The ones pressuring them to not  look upwards were the nobles and royalty such as myself, so the right to  punish them for belittling the things below them was something which I  did not possess.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“It seems there are a lot of people to kill.”</p><p>……Except for Lapis.</p><p>Since Lapis was a girl born at the absolute bottom, to her, she had  more than enough rights to send the heads of those above her flying. She  was a girl whom even I could not stop. No one could stop her. I prayed  for the repose of those poignant souls in advance. Please have an easy  passage into eternity.</p><p>It was at the moment we were docilely passing by one of the military  camps. The soldiers started to throw clumps of snow at our ranks. My men  became bewildered and stopped their advance. The 11 members of the  Berbere Sisters, who could be referred to as my royal bodyguards,  instantly covered the area around me.</p><p>The snow collided against the witches. Being hit by snow on their  foreheads, cheeks, and torsos, the witches became soiled. The witches  silently endured the barrage until they became a complete mess. They did  not utter a single word while being hit. Just like the time they were  abused by Demon Lord Andromalius in the past.</p><p>From the other side, the demon troops made invidious remarks.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— For your honor’s mistress to be an outcast, general to be a human,  and royal bodyguards to be witches, your honor’s good faith impales the  sky. Indeed, it’s befitting of the King of Peasants.</p><p>— You must be very fortunate to be so popular with women, your honor!  Please teach the people how to bed lowly harlots and spread the  information throughout the world.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Snow continued to fly towards us. They were not aiming at me but were  throwing the snow in order to hit the witches. Despite that, the  witches, in concern for the worst situation, did not leave my side for  even the slightest moment. The witches merely guarded me with a stoic  expression on their face.</p><p>“……Lapis.”</p><p>“Yes, your highness?”</p><p>“Where are those bullock bones from?”</p><p>“It appears a three-legged goat is drawn on their flag. That belongs  to the rank 12th Demon Lord, Sitri. The soldiers led by Sitri are  renowned for their rough volubility and coarse speaking habits.”</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p>“Then if I were to slit the throats of those soldiers, that’ll be the same as making the Mountain Faction into our enemy.”</p><p>Sitri was a loyal subject to Paimon. Even if they had provoked us  first, a big incident would occur if I were to kill them thoughtlessly.</p><p>No, they may be starting this ruckus in order to cause a big incident  on purpose. If the current situation were to get any worse, then there  will certainly be a faction who will use my decision of putting a human  as my general as the problem, and place it as the public opinion. That  the privates were probably dissatisfied just because I had made an  individual with no prestige into my general.</p><p>If that were to happen then I would be at a disadvantage. They would  be taunting me and dragging me into a situation where it was favorable  for them. What should I do? How should I deal with this mess……?</p><p>I wonder if it had detected that I had fallen into deep thought. With  a jaunty sound effect, a selection window appeared before me.</p><p>Ο</p><p>[1. Punish the insults.]</p><p>[2. Endure the insults.]</p><p>Ο</p><p>I carefully gazed at the words floating in mid-air.</p><p>Even if the soldiers were wretchedly throwing clumps of snow towards a  Demon Lord, such as myself, I did not feel any particular anger because  of it. Insults were disgraceful when done by someone of a similar  standing. So what if some soldiers tossed snow at me?</p><p>The problem was face. The issue was always one’s honor. The witches  were being hit by the filth in my stead, but if I were to do nothing and  pass the situation by like this, then my honor as a monarch would be  damaged. Farnese, who must have also been concerned of this, whispered  to me some advice.</p><p>“Lord. Should we not kill those men immediately? Even if we do not  kill them, if we bind them and shove their faces into the ground then  they’ll shut up on their own.”</p><p>“This one disapproves.”</p><p>Lapis whispered to me in a low voice on my other side.</p><p>“Seeing that mere privates are openly insulting your highness, there  is no doubt that Demon Lord Sitri is supporting them from behind. There  is no benefit your highness can gain by colliding against Sitri. Refrain  from doing something rash.”</p><p>“How could enduring be a king’s only method? Miss Lapis. You never  close your eyes towards the ridicule you receive, and yet, how could you  request for his lordship to turn a blind eye towards the humiliation he  receives?”</p><p>“Since this one is a humble vassal, it is fine for this one to behave  basely. A humble individual’s generosity is the act of forgetting  oneself and behaving with impudence. Disgracefulness is a shallowness  befitting this one’s place. However, his highness is different. Please  be tolerant.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I spoke.</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>“This is not something that can be solved by stopping, lord. This  young lady is an illegitimate child of a lowly servant girl, so it is  appropriate for this young lady to receive insults. However, how is this  young lady supposed to endure the situation where her lord is unjustly  being ridiculed? Please order this young lady to take their necks.”</p><p>“Your highness. Miss Farnese is still young. Do not listen to her.  Even if the people were to praise your highness, your majesty will not  rise, and even if people were to jeer at your highness, your dignity  will not be damaged. Please understand.”</p><p>“Sheesh. I told you two to stop, and yet you two continue to bicker.”</p><p>I raised my right hand.</p><p>The moment I did so, the witches all raised their staves at once. My  troops also broke apart from their marching ranks and lifted their  spears. It took no longer than a couple of seconds for my troops, which  consisted of 4,000 soldiers, to display their vigor.</p><p>The encampment became quiet. An aggressive silence, which felt as if a  fight could erupt at any second, flowed. Even the soldiers who were  tossing snow at us had pulled out their swords with their muddied hands.  They continued to babble on narrow-mindedly.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Does Your Honor plan to cut us lowly subjects down? That’s fine.  Since Your Honor had stabbed the throat of His Highness Andromalius in  order to save the life of a succubus whore, then killing dozens or  hundreds of us lowly subjects for the sake of those witches should also  be possible, right?</p><p>— Please step over our corpses with your honor’s grace.</p><p>Ο</p><p>I dismounted from my horse. I wiped off the mud smeared on the  witches’ faces with my clothes. The mud was smudged on them rather  excessively so it did not get wiped off easily. Moistening the lower end  of my clothes with the snow, I wiped clean the skin of the witches.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—……</p><p>Ο</p><p>The sight of a member of the noblest stratum in the demon world  cleaning the face of a peasant, hundreds of thousands of soldiers  watched while holding their breath. Within the heavy atmosphere, only  the witches chatted and giggled quietly.</p><p>“Ahah, really our master……”</p><p>“His way of thinking is really abnormal, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Right—?”</p><p><em>(TL note: Changed the way the  witches referred to Dantalian to ‘Master’. The raw word used can be  translated to both ‘Lord’ and ‘Master’, but after reading Volume 3, it  seems ‘Master’ would be more appropriate.)</em></p><p>I deliberately whispered to them in a serious tone.</p><p>“Be quiet. Do not ruin the mood.”</p><p>“Roger.”</p><p>The witches responded faintly. Although my facial expression was  stoic like before, it was not the same impassive expression as before. I  sincerely cleaned all 11 witches.</p><p>The mud that was trickling from the witches was all moved onto my  clothes, so now I was the one that was filthy. I took my mantle off and  draped it over the leader of the group, Witch Humbaba. After brushing  her shoulder twice, I remounted my horse.</p><p>“Let us depart.”</p><p>“Set forth!”</p><p>Farnese shouted.</p><p>The soldiers who were enthusiastically ridiculing us could not stop  our march. As if they were embarrassed, they lowered their heads. The  bottom line in the selection window glowed brightly and dispersed in  mid-air.</p><p>Ο</p><p><strong>[A kind and merciful decision!]</strong></p><p><strong>[Witch Humbaba’s affection went up by 3.]</strong></p><p><strong>[Witch Stheno’s affection went up by 9.]</strong></p><p><strong>[Witch Euryale’s affection went up by 8.]</strong></p><p>Ο</p><p>Looking up at the words that broke apart like a flurry of snow, I  smiled. I was already doing well, so was there really a need for it to  compliment me about it? 100 points is already 100% so there’s nothing  more to add, after all.</p><p>Lapis spoke.</p><p>“95 points, your highness.”</p><p>“Ara? That score is subtly suspicious. What are the grounds for the deduction in points?”</p><p>“A man who is too perfect is aggravating, is he not? This one was  concerned that your highness would become bothersome, so this one was  being slightly considerate. Since removing 5 points is, in truth, the  same as adding 5 points, this is this one’s method of displaying her  loyalty to your highness.”</p><p>Sure.</p><p>Good for you!</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Demon Lord of Benevolence, Rank 9th, Paimon<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 2, Day 12</p><p> Yotvingian Plains, Demon Lord Allied Forces Garrison</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>“What should we do, sis……?”</p><p>Sitri asked with a teary voice.</p><p>We quietly watched Demon Lord Dantalian go by with his troops in tow.  There was nothing we could do. This lady’s plan of provoking Dantalian,  in order to someway or another delay the start of war, was thus a  complete failure.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“I’m sorry, Big Sis Paimon. I chose the most vulgar mouthed soldiers  among my troops and spread them out, but it seems that wasn’t enough.”</p><p>“No. It’s not your fault Sitri. The other party had merely handled  the situation smoothly. I tried provoking him since I had heard a rumor  that he cherished his subordinates, but for his expression to not shift  even once……”</p><p>My mind felt heavy.</p><p>Ever since last year, the feeling that this lady, no, not only this  lady but all of the Demon Lords as well, were being swept up by  Dantalian’s pace did not disappear. Was it merely this lady who was  mistaken?</p><p>It was fine to consider Dantalian’s reputation to be the absolute  worst. He had declared an outcast as his fiancée(This is illegal), made a  human into his acting general(This as well is illegal), and  furthermore, his Demon Lord Castle, which was his stronghold, had  fallen. In the public eye, the assessment of Dantalian was horrendous. A  fool blinded by love, a filthy debauchee……</p><p>However, this lady thought differently.</p><p>There was no other choice but to think differently.</p><p>Within half a year, Dantalian was able to rise up to one of the  highest positions among the richest individuals in the demon world. If  that man were a fool, then that would be impossible to achieve. If you  looked further into it, the trigger to start this upcoming war  originated from Dantalian’s Demon Lord Castle having been invaded. Was  this a coincidence?</p><p>If anything, should one not look at this backwards?</p><p>That that man had personally induced his public image to appear like a fool and a parvenu.</p><p>“……”</p><p>My face became stiff.</p><p>If this lady’s intuition was correct, then that would mean that  Dantalian was playing around with the entire demon world at his own  will. To always achieve what he desired, while at the same time making  that achievement appear like pure chance. He disguised everything to  appear as if it had flowed like that because of luck. There were a  countless number of people who fail but pretend to have succeeded.  However, people who have succeeded but acted as if they had failed were  rare. Furthermore, the occasion where that act would be carried on and  continued was even more uncommon.</p><p>If we don’t deal with him by any means then.</p><p>“Big sister. Are you alright?”</p><p>Sitri looked at me with a worried expression on her face.</p><p>Oh dear, it seems this lady’s face had unintentionally become  excessively serious without her knowing. Following my long time habit, I  moved the edges of my lips and formed a natural smile.</p><p>“Yes, I am fine. You are very kind, Sitri.”</p><p>“Ehe.”</p><p>Once I stroked her head, Sitri rubbed her cheek against my hand. How cute.</p><p>That night, I sent away every soldier who was in the vicinity of my  quarters and called for the spy. The spy was a short girl. With a pitch  black cloak wrapped around her entire body, the spy lowered herself to  one knee.</p><p>“Did your highness call?”</p><p>“Yes. Was there any inconvenience on your way here?”</p><p>“Ahah, it’s alright. Sir Dantalian’s camp is currently having a  drinking party, so the security is lax. There were no cumbersome gazes  while concealing myself all the way here, so it’s fine.”</p><p>“A drinking party, is it……?”</p><p>“He threw a banquet saying that everyone did a good job for marching  through the snow and rain for a week. Since alcohol and boar meat are  being served indefinitely, the privates are going wild. Normally, the  night watch would be managed by a girl named Lazuli, but she was caught  by Sir Dantalian and is currently pouring him his drinks. That’s why  this one was able to sneak out easily—.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>That was most likely not the only reason for throwing a banquet.</p><p>Although Dantalian may have sagaciously gotten past the situation  from this afternoon, the likelihood that Dantalian’s soldiers were still  harboring in their minds the humiliation that their monarch had  received was high. The banquet was held to disentangle their frustrated  minds.</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>Dantalian was not a foolish fellow. This lady’s instincts were warning her as so.</p><p>In the world, something with a million to one chance could always  occur. The path that Dantalian had walked until now could truly be  nothing more than a coincidence. A method to identify whether it was an  inevitability or a coincidence did not exist for this lady. If the  ability to discern whether something was an inevitability or a  coincidence was not available, this lady tended to lean towards it being  an inevitability.</p><p>That was why I had bribed the spy in front of me.</p><p>“Show me the evidence that you claimed could slander Dantalian.”</p><p>The spy took out a pocket watch from inside her cloak and laid it on  the floor. As soon as this lady flicked her wrist, the pocket watch  floated to her hand. Since this spy’s stratum was so low that it could  be compared to that of an outcast, in accordance with the laws in the  demon world, direct contact with her was forbidden.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Is this a Memory Play artifact?”</p><p>“Yup. Setting it to 12, 7, 5, 4, 2 ,3, and 11 will do.”</p><p>“This lady is looking forward to seeing what sort of content lies within this.”</p><p>I turned the hour hand of the pocket watch according to the sequence the spy had stated.</p><p>A white smoke leaked out from the watch and a video was projected  onto the fumes. Dantalian’s figure appeared within the scenery displayed  on the smoke. Dantalian was holding the human girl, whom he had made  into his acting general, in his arms. Witches could be seen as well.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Turn this place into Hell.</p><p>— Aha? By ‘Hell’, does master mean?</p><p>— I can smell a scent somewhere. It is the smell of fat emanating  from disgusting masses of flesh. It is the smell of greed and hypocrisy</p><p>Ο</p><p>Is that…… a market?</p><p>Seeing that there were iron cages around them, it seemed to be a  slave market. What appeared to be the corpses of guards were collapsed  on the ground. Dantalian grinned towards the witches.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— If they are pigs, then it would only be appropriate for them to  behave like pigs and oink in a pigsty, and yet, why are they striding so  boldly along the streets? What are you to do when these pigs are  arrogantly trying to imitate people and shove their noses everywhere?</p><p>— Naturally, you have to imprint onto them that they are pigs!</p><p>— Only people can possess slaves. It seems those runts are arrogantly  going against the moral of beasts and trying to handle slaves.</p><p>— Please give us the order. We shall make this place into a slaughterhouse tonight!</p><p>— Yes. The command that I shall order is slaughter. Slaughter those  bastards without giving them the chance to even scream. This is not  murder. Do not let your conscience weigh down your heart and hesitation  take over your hands. As you are lords of all creation, with the  authority granted to you all by the Goddesses, slaughter these livestock  for our extensive cause.</p><p>— As you command, master!</p><p>Ο</p><p>And the slaughter began.</p><p>Shooting through the night sky, the witches killed every last human.  It was not only humans. Even the demons caught as slaves were put to  death. The market instantly degenerated into a burning hell, and people  burned between the flames. I watched the figures of them wailing while  dumbstruck.</p><p>“What is this……?”</p><p>“The scene of the slaughter that Sir Dantalian had ordered.”</p><p>The spy responded.</p><p>“Although the rumors say that Sir Dantalian had picked up Miss  Farnese, who was wandering around aimlessly, by chance. Ahah. That is  actually a lie. Sir Dantalian had personally gone to rescue Miss Farnese  who was confined within the slave market in Pavia.”</p><p>“But why the order to slaughter……?”</p><p>“Since there can’t be any evidence.”</p><p>This lady became speechless.</p><p>For that reason alone.</p><p>The massacre was still taking place in the video. Regardless of their  race or age, the witches got rid of every figure that came into their  sight. There were even the tremendously weak sirens and children among  the slaughtered.</p><p>The screams of a child and the laughter of witches mixed together. It  blended together like smoke. Endlessly, endlessly…… my head became so  dizzy that I ended up closing my eyes. Until the video had ended. This  lady could not contain the tragedy in her eyes.</p><p>“……Is this not fabricated?”</p><p>“Fabricate a video of this size? Surely your highness is joking–.  Even if someone were to use disguise magic to imitate the core  individuals, Sir Dantalian and Miss Farnese, then what about the rest of  the people? Does your highness think that hundreds of mages would use  disguise magic to make this sort of video?”</p><p>The spy laughed.</p><p>“Ahahah, if that were true then a rumor would have spread a long time  ago. Your highness should know well since your highness Paimon is  a mage much more outstanding than this one, but utilizing hundreds of  mages in secret is impossible. Additionally, the screams from the  children are extremely realistic, so to consider that as an act is—.”</p><p><em>Slap</em></p><p>The spy fell to the floor. The spy, who was slapped by my hand,  tumbled onto the ground. Because this lady could not bear it any longer,  while forgetting everything about the demon world laws, I kicked the  spy.</p><p>“Aha, ah hah haha……ahahahahahah……”</p><p>Even while being kicked, the spy continued to laugh. What could  possibly be that funny? Could the sight of innocent children being  killed be nothing more than a joke to this spy? The sound of this spy’s  laughter was detestable. The sound of giggling unpleasantly latched onto  my skin. This lady stomped on the spy with more force in order to strip  herself of that unpleasantry. I felt disgusted at myself for having  hired someone like this as my spy. I was the fool for having believed  that they were pure at one point.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The bunch who had sold their souls.</p><p>The absolute bottom of everything inferior.</p><p>The prostitutes of souls.</p><p>With her face planted into the ground, the spy grinned.</p><p>“Your highness–? It is fine to vent your anger, but didn’t your highness hire us since you needed this sort of evidence–?”</p><p>—Witch.</p><p>The head of the Berbere Sisters, the possessor of the Triphyllous Badge, Witch Humbaba.</p><p>Even after her platinum blonde hair was covered in dirt, she did not  lose her amusement. There was no madness in her laugh. Whether witches  laughed normally, laughed because something was funny, or laughed when  they were feeling anguished, their laughter was constantly the same.  Therefore, it was constantly disgusting.</p><p>“……You are a bunch who should not have been born into this world.”</p><p>“We hear that often–.”</p><p>“Is there truly no feeling of sorriness for the lives of others in your minds?”</p><p>“This one apologizes, but we’ve already sold our souls—?”</p><p>It seems words would not get through to her.</p><p>Although people considered it regrettable that we could not converse  with beasts, beasts did not care about being unable to converse with  people. Similarly, witches did not even contemplate the idea of sharing a  conversation with us people.</p><p>This lady took out a pouch of gold and tossed it. The moment the  pouch fell to the floor and gave off a metallic jingle, Humbaba  immediately turned her head towards the sound. She embraced the pouch as  if it were the loveliest child in the world.</p><p>“Your highness’ kindness is immeasurable. Thank you very much. Hehe.”</p><p>“I put in half the amount of the promised gold.”</p><p>“……Half–?”</p><p>Humbaba froze.</p><p>I coldly gazed down at the witch.</p><p>“I will give you the remaining half once the task is completely over.”</p><p>“That’s a little bit different compared to the promise that this one had heard previously–……”</p><p>“Dantalian had personally wiped the dirt off of you all earlier  today, and yet, you all had betrayed that Dantalian. Do I have even the  slightest reason to place my trust in you?”</p><p>“Mm–, well–, hm–. Ahahah? That’s right. Of course. Your highness is correct.”</p><p>Humbaba straightened her cone hat. The witch’s face was no longer visible because of the wide brim of her hat.</p><p>“But at least the other promise……”</p><p>“Yes. On a Walpurgis Night, I will petition for every witch that had  participated in this war to receive a Leaf Medal. You’ll then be a  veteran in possession of a Quadriphyllous. Congratulations.”</p><p>“Ahaha. That is a great favor.”</p><p>The witch beamed brightly. The medal with a leaf shape on it was  proof that an individual had devoted oneself to their kind in a field of  war. No matter how many times one were to participate in a civil war  between Demon Lords, you were not granted a leaf. As much as our current  situation was going to become a massive war against the humans, it  meant that it was going to meet the conditions for the witch before me  to be given a leaf.</p><p>Regardless, people of the low class were originally unable to receive  medals, excluding the extremely rare cases. Despite that, just like  they had done now, these witches were able to somehow gain medals  through constant repetition of betrayal and trickery. One’s honor should  be established by one’s self and not by relying on others, and yet……  They were a despicable group.</p><p>This lady waved her hand.</p><p>“I do not wish to see you any further. Get out.”</p><p>“My apologies for sullying your highness’ eyes.”</p><p>Humbaba wrapped herself in her cloak and left. Just like she had done  when she arrived, her footsteps had no sound while leaving as well. It  felt as if she was still somewhere in the quarters because of  her noiseless footsteps.</p><p>“……”</p><p>This lady silently stared at the pocket watch. The problem now was  where I was going to utilize this strong evidence. Unfortunately, it is  clear that this video will not have any particular use in bringing the  war to a halt. Currently, the person holding the lead position for the  advocacy of war was Barbatos. Even if Dantalian were to be accused,  Barbatos would heed it no mind and execute the war anyway. However, even  if it was unable to stop the war then……</p><p>My worries became deeper along with the night. Thinking about the  destiny of the ones born as monarchs, this lady’s head became numb. I  shared the responsibility in the proclamation of war, and yet, only the  lives of the soldiers will be taken away through it. My heart pounded by  the thought that no matter what occurred, I will remain alive.</p><p>A massive war.</p><p>At the very least, a devastating war must be prevented……</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 2, Day 13</p><p> Yotvingian Plains, Demon Lord Allied Forces Garrison</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>“I heard you personally wiped clean some witches.

You may leave now.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Lapis, who was helping me throughout the night with documents, left  without a word. While Lapis was my woman, I was Barbatos’ man, thus  Lapis behaved as if she were invisible while in front of Barbatos, and  Barbatos treated Lapis as if she were not there. The distance between  Barbatos and Lapis was too vast for them to connect with each other for  the reason that they shared the same man. Once Lapis left the tent, I  spoke.</p><p>“Rumors spread quite fast.”</p><p>“I’m here to compliment you. You did well holding back. Ten to one,  I’m certain that incident was one of that bitch Paimon’s schemes.”</p><p>“Probably. That’s why I endured it.”</p><p>“It’s impressive to say you’ll endure it and actually be able to  endure it. If it were me, then I would have punched Sitri right in her  face. Dantalian, you’re a big shot.”</p><p>As if something was funny, Barbatos cackled. She was the type of  person to not tell people why she was laughing, and I was the bastard  who didn’t disregard it and made sure to ask what was so funny.</p><p>“What’s so humorous? Let’s laugh together.”</p><p>“It’s hilarious since the upright guy who believes in witches just  looks like a retard. Hey, do you want to know something amusing? You  know I constantly place agents around that bitch Paimon, right? She’s  the type of bitch who pretends to be pure and coy while doing everything  she wants, after all. If I don’t spread observers around her, then  sheesh, I can’t feel reassured.”</p><p>Barbatos grinned.</p><p>“Well, that bitch probably has agents planted around me as well, but  that isn’t what’s important right now. Do you know who just went into  that bitch Paimon’s tent?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>I gazed at Barbatos. Excluding the white candles placed on top of the  table, there were no other sources of light in the tent. When the  candle light trembled, the shadow covering Barbatos’ face shook as well.  Regardless of that trembling, Barbatos smiled grimly. I shook my head.</p><p>“That isn’t possible.”</p><p>“How innocent. That’s cute.”</p><p>“……Humbaba? Euryale?”</p><p>“Who knows? I don’t know well enough to know their name. I only know  that after leaving that bitch Paimon’s tent they disappeared into your  camp.”</p><p>“Give me the evidence.”</p><p>Barbatos raised her middle finger.</p><p>“Eat shit, Dantalian. I won’t give someone like you evidence. Whether  you believe my words or not, that’s something you’ll have to decide on  your own. My duties were finished the moment I didn’t turn a blind eye  towards this matter.”</p><p>After leaving those words, Barbatos left casually. There was no farewell. It was truly like her to not give a refined greeting, and simply toss aside something that she had started on a whim.  I became as awkward as a preschooler who was suddenly faced with a  drawing paper that was forcefully given to him because of a teacher’s  discretion. How was I going to deal with this?</p><p>Betrayal was a social response which occurred when a single contract  was not fulfilled adequately. However, I have never infringed on the  contract shared between myself and the witches. Although I did not doubt  the fact that betrayal was an obvious occurrence in the world, I was  suspicious because I believed that a betrayal without reason could not  exist. A sudden thought occurred to me. Could this not be a type of  signal?</p><p>I quietly exited my tent and headed towards the witches’ quarters.  The witches had built a large tent for themselves and resided in it  together. I wondered if they were controlling the temperature with  magic since the inside of their tent was humid despite the blizzard  outside. The witches were playing around with each other and entangling  their bodies with one another. Even after seeing me enter their tent,  the witches did not put on their tops.</p><p>“Ara, Master? What brings you here on this night?”</p><p>“Did our master finally start to yearn for our blooming bodies and has come to visit us in order to grant us your Royal Grace—?”</p><p>The witches giggled. Among them, there were three or four witches who  were pressing against one another and licking the others’ skin.  A  strong flowery fragrance emanated from the air. It was the smell of  decadence.  Because the fragrance was so thick, I could not distinguish  whether I was breathing through my nose or being waterboarded by  extracts. The heaven and earth on all four sides were being enveloped by  the winter, making the world white, but the witches had separately made  this place into a small red-light district.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I clicked my tongue.</p><p>“It appears this place isn’t a military camp but a licensed quarter instead. Do I have to pay an entrance fee?”</p><p>“Of course not. Our master is always welcomed.”</p><p>“Tsk, these obscene fellows……”</p><p>I sat down anywhere that felt convenient. The witch who was suddenly sat on by me let out a playful yelp.</p><p>“A yin and yang should be fusing together in order to form a union,  and yet, you girls seem to be in quite the fine state with lewd fellows  playing around with other indecent fellows.”</p><p><em>(TL note: Yin(Female Energy), lewd, and  indecent all start with the same first letter. So he’s referring to  the witches as them being both obscene and getting along with only other  women.)</em></p><p>“Eeh. Why is our Master being concerned when this isn’t the first or second time you’ve seen us like this?”</p><p>“Is there anything that Master had done in order to supplement us for being obscene, disorderly, and slovenly–?”</p><p>“Be quiet. You girls are being too bold since you are not even  concerned about dying by a sword on a battlefield, but instead, you’re  preparing to die by coition first. Hurry up and go put on some  undergarments. I have something serious to discuss, that is why I have  come all the way here myself.”</p><p>The witches pouted and draped clothes over their shoulders. In truth,  it was an outfit that was more befitting to be called cloth than actual  clothing. The nape of their necks were wide open and their chests were  completely revealed. Seeing that they were exposing themselves while in  my presence, it was clear that they were trying to tease me. I didn’t  feel like reprimanding them any further, so I let it be.</p><p>The witches adjusted their clothes slowly. They seemed to think that  if they did that, then I would turn into an animal of passion and pounce  at them. Seeing their ridiculous behavior, I let out a snort, and once I  did so, the witches grumbled with a face that displayed discontent. At  any rate, these fellows did not know their limit.</p><p>I gazed at Humbaba who posed as the leader of the witches.</p><p>“Is there any inconvenience while residing in the camp?”</p><p>“We are endowed with both something to eat and a place to sleep, so something like inconvenience couldn’t possibly exist-.”</p><p>“I am worried since you all used to be abused commonly. Are there no vulgar fellows who mistreat or beat you?”</p><p>“Yes. The people who abuse us are normally nobles, but as your  lordship already knows, there are no nobles in your camp, and even if  there are, only minor nobles who stink of piss on the family tree are  present-……”</p><p>The witches’ complexions gradually became darker.</p><p>There was no chance that their lord would come pay them a visit past  midnight just to inquire them of their well-being. There was a sequence  in conversations, so a ground must be spread out first. However, since  the ground kept being set down, the witches were worried about what sort  of talk was going to come next. Once I closed my mouth, the tent became  silent. The quarters was still humid, yet it was no longer a  pleasurable warmth but just plain heat instead. I spoke.</p><p>“I heard that you girls betrayed me. Why did you do it?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“I do not wish to quibble over the improperness of you all and the information given. Tell me the reason behind the betrayal.”</p><p>Over the tent, the sound of an owl hooting could be heard. The  witches’ tent was thin so the sound of the bird felt nearby. It was  forbidden for witches to wear or use the leather of animals. That was  the law in the demon world. The tent was made completely out of cotton.  Once the owl’s hooting ceased, Humbaba spoke.</p><p>“This one shall atone for the crime with her death.”</p><p>“I asked for the reason of betrayal. Would I not need to know  something before being able to determine whether if I am to accept your  apology or not? There would be no meaning if you were to die on your  own.”</p><p>“We craved money–.”</p><p>“Money? If you desired for money, then you could have asked me, could  you have not? You all should know well that I possess so much money  that it is nearly unmanageable.”</p><p>“As there is nothing more terrifying than free money, it is also  uncongenial to us. Rather, doing spy work is more efficient and clean.”</p><p>“Oh, these imbeciles.”</p><p>I placed my hand on my forehead. My brain started to hurt.</p><p>I understood that since these witches lived their entire lives being  scorned by the other races, the only place they could put their trust  into was money. People did not consider the act of breaking a promise  with low-class individuals as shameful. As long as it was not a business  relationship, betrayal was a peasant’s destined fate. It was  heartrending to see these girl use their destiny as an excuse.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“And so? Did you get some money?”</p><p>“Nope. We only got half the promised amount–.”</p><p>“What? ……After having betrayed me, you were embezzled half the amount?”</p><p>I was taken aback.</p><p>“Dear God. I already knew that you all were imbeciles but I did not  consider you would also be a bunch of pushovers. If you’re going to stab  someone in the back, then do it properly. Just what are you doing?”</p><p>“We heard that Miss Paimon was kind towards even peasants, so we were  a bit hopeful. But it turned out that she was less kind than the  rumors. Ahahaha.”</p><p>“You’re laughing? Does laughter really come out right now?”</p><p>The witches’ shoulders trembled.</p><p>I pressed them for answers in order to find out what information they  had sold. ‘No, it’s nothing big. It really is nothing’, and the crime  which Humbaba confessed ended up belonging to the category of being  something big. After hearing the truth that they had passed over the  entire process of retrieving Farnese and the process of ordering the  slaughter to Paimon, I grabbed the back of my neck. When I asked them  how much money they were supposed to receive, they responded with 3,000  gold. Since they had lost half of that, they were barely able to get  1,500 gold after having sold me out.</p><p>How maddening.</p><p>The sight of a mantle hanging on a clothesline within the tent came  into my vision. It was the black mantle that I had gifted to Humbaba  yesterday. All of the dirty stains were gone and the mantle was dried  stiff, which made me wonder if they had washed it with the snow outside.  It seemed that to the witches, the sincerity of washing the piece of  clothing that I had given them and the lighthearted act of betraying me  for money, easily coexisted together.</p><p>The amusement on the witches’ faces was gone. I was able to see the  witches with an emotionless face for the first time. That did not appear  awkward to them at all. People who were always smiling were supposed to  be people with a reason to constantly smile, but the very fact that  they had to constantly laugh was not that humorous to them. That was the  reason.</p><p>I spoke as if I was letting out a sigh.</p><p>“Girls, politics misbecome you. The Demon Lords and I are currently  moving behind the scenes, and if a bunch of girls as pure as you all  were to try and squeeze in, then you will only be injured greatly. Since  you all have gone against the military order, you must pay the  penalty.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Bring a cutting board. I will cut a single finger from all of you.”</p><p>One by one, I sliced off a finger from the witches with my dagger. It  was the same dagger that I had used to commit my first murder after  having fallen into this world, the blade that had killed Andromalius.</p><p>When the ring finger on their left hand was being severed off, the  witches did not appear as if they felt any particular pain. A sense of  pain and mind that should have fallen along with their ring finger did  not exist in the witches. While cutting their fingers, I spoke.</p><p>“Since your lifespans are long, you will one day meet your life-long  partner. Even if that life-long partner were to confess their love and  propose to you, you now no longer have the finger to put a ring on. You  are forever crippled. Repent in dust and ashes for the foolishness of  not having cherished a bond and having hastily betrayed it. You will  understand this feeling when you meet the one you love.”</p><p>“……Master.”</p><p>“Come find me when the day is bright. I shall give you the rest of the gold which you were unable to receive.”</p><p>I wiped the dagger with the edge of my coat and left the quarters.  Once I returned to my own tent, Lapis was arranging the bedding. Through  some method, Lapis had listened in on the conversation shared between  myself and the witches, so she knew everything.</p><p>“5 points, your highness. The penalty was excessively weak. It would be better off to have killed them.”</p><p>“They got caught on purpose.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>I lifted an alcohol bottle and drank straight from it.</p><p>“Would witches who have lived for over 200 years be that naive? They  clearly know that Barbatos is intimate with me, so if they were to do  spy work, then they would have behaved more carefully. Despite that, did  they not go back and forth from my and Paimon’s encampment without any  disguise whatsoever?”</p><p>Lapis supported her chin with her hand.</p><p>“Is your highness saying that the witches had betrayed your highness  on purpose in order to get caught? This one does not understand. What  benefit could they possibly gain from doing so?”</p><p>“It’s a test. They were testing to see whether if I am truly a good person to depend on or not.”</p><p>“A test……”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“They must have felt anxious since I have been constantly treating  them with kindness. They wanted to believe and devote their loyalty to  me, but they were unable to because they were uncertain whether if I  would cherish them or not. That is why they tested me. If need be, they  may have harbored the idea of jumping ship and joining Paimon’s side……”</p><p>It seems Lapis was half in doubt after having heard my words.</p><p>Once dawn arrived, the witches came. Since they did not have the  heart to enter my quarters, the witches were kneeling on the snow  outside. Once I stepped out of my tent, the 11 sisters lowered their  bare bodies on the snow. They were not wearing clothes.</p><p>On the witches’ pure white backs, permanent scars remained. Whip  marks, scald marks from past tortures, and wounds that were healed then  injured again until the scars remained fully intact, these injuries  lingered on their bodies. Each witch, who was wearing nothing, had a  necklace around their neck and hanging from that necklace was the ring  finger that I had cut.</p><p>Humbaba lowered her forehead to the ground.</p><p>“Us Berbere Sisters, born without a home, raised in the back alleys  of towns and villages, and individuals who have spent our lives as  mercenaries for decades and centuries, wish to now forget our pasts and  find value in our lives as solely Demon Lord Dantalian’s followers. Our  hearts, our heads, our souls will forever be a part of your highness’  possessions. Therefore, your highness, please take care of our lost  hearts, heads, and souls.”</p><p>An oath of fealty.</p><p>When nobles pledge their fealty, they devoted their hearts, a  commoner devoted both their hearts and heads, and peasants devoted  everything up to even their souls.</p><p>I brought out all of the mantles that I possessed and put them on  each and every one of them. The witches earnestly adjusted their black  mantles. I placed my forehead against Humbaba’s forehead.</p><p>“I vow, that I, Dantalian, shall never return thy advice with  silence, and shall never return thy suggestions with scorn. If thou art  to sweat and bleed for my behalf, then I shall repay thee the exact  weight for every drop of sweat and blood.”</p><p>Ο</p><p><strong>[The Berbere Sisters have been recruited as subordinates.]</strong></p><p><strong>[The degree of loyalty will appear in the witches’ statuses.]</strong></p><p><strong>[A complete and firm allegiance. The other party regards you  as their one and only lord. They will not betray you as long as you do  not betray them first.]</strong></p><p>Ο</p><p><img data-attachment-id=\"28613\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2016/09/13/dungeon-defense-volume-3-chapter-2-part-2/%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-3-page-173/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-173.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,1757\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-3-page-173\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-173.jpg?w=205\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-173.jpg?w=700\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-173.jpg?w=700\" alt=\"%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-3-page-173\"></p><p>Ο</p><p>By accepting these girls, it was the same as acknowledging that even witches had souls.</p><p>The witches sobbed into the snow. They weren’t tears shed for me, but  for themselves. They sat kneeling within the fluttering snow for a long  period of time. I brushed off the snow that fell onto their heads with  my hand.</p><p>Ο</p><p>♦</p><p>Ο</p><p>On this day, the Demon Lord Allied Forces’ strategy was ultimately decided.</p><table><tbody><tr><td>First Army. Rank 8<sup>th</sup>, Barbatos<p> Advance with the Plains Faction and 21,000 soldiers under her command.</p><p> Second Army. Rank 5<sup>th</sup>, Marbas.</p><p> Advance with the Neutral Faction and 15,000 soldiers under his command.</p><p> Third Army. Rank 9<sup>th</sup>, Paimon</p><p> Advance with the Mountain Faction and 13,000 soldiers under her command.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Although the lineup of armies reached up to the Sixth Army, the  armies written on the paper were only these. The rank 1st, Great Demon  Lord Baal led the Sixth Army, but Baal did not lead an army to meet with  us here. There were around 30 other Demon Lords who were also like  that.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>In other words, this was our entire army.</p><p>The dignity of the Demon Lord Allied Forces, which had at one time  led a massive army of over 100,000 soldiers throughout the plains, had  descended this far. Although no one would admit it, everyone already  knew. That the era of Demon Lords was over.</p><p>The humans had slowly succeeded in a centralized authoritarian rule,  and in this era where kingdoms and empires were being built up upon, the  demons were still being managed by villages and clans. The demons  pointed at the humans and looked down at them, referring to them as  tamed livestock, however, the reality was the complete opposite. The  Demons were miserable beasts that weren’t even able to be tamed.</p><p>This age has already become dark. The majority of the continent was  occupied by the humans. The demons could either wither away while being  surrounded by the humans or entrust their bodies on a hopeless final  war. Either way, it was suicide.</p><p>Paimon, who suggested that we should huddle up since there was no  hope in winning a war, or Barbatos who declared that there wouldn’t be  a chance for survival if we were to stay docile so a war must be waged.  They were nothing more than pioneers who had smelt the scent of  annihilation and had become desperate.</p><p>Barbatos who shouted for dispatch, claiming that this was the golden  opportunity given to us by the heavens since the humans were being  exterminated by the Black Death spreading throughout the continent. Or  Paimon, who warned everyone that there would be no end in a war  initiated while believing not in the strength of our own army, but in  the weakness of the enemies, so once war is commenced, it cannot be  taken back. There seemed to be no elucidation in throwing open the doors  to a new age.</p><p>In an era with no clarity, Barbatos discussed the duty of a  monarch who had to lead their subjects, and Paimon conferred the fate of  a monarch who had to fall with their subjects. Even if they followed  their duty or accepted their fate, the thing to be thrown away was the  lives of the people. Whether it was better to offer one’s life to  one’s task, or to throw away one’s life by following one’s destiny,  neither Barbatos nor Paimon could answer that question. It was an  unanswerable question. In order to find the path which contained  the answer, the Demon Lords led lives down their respective paths.</p><p>Barbatos went south. The ground was flat and vast in the southern  region. It was easy to both lead an army through and transport  provisions. It was also simple for battles to occur. It seemed Barbatos  was searching for her path on the endlessly stretched out horizon.  However, Barbatos most likely did not know what would be waiting for her  past the horizon. She was not a monarch that questioned the end, but  was simply a monarch that walked down the path.</p><p>Paimon went west. The mountain terrain was perilous in the west. It  was difficult to both lead an army through and move provisions. It  seemed Paimon was going to seek for her path after having gotten out of  the rugged mountain range. However, it was clear that after Paimon  escaped from the mountains, she would be unsure which direction to take.  She was a monarch that searched for the end of the path, but got lost  on the way.</p><p>And I obliquely traversed between the south and west.</p><p>The south-west was an easy and difficult route to pass through. It  was a location where a single mountain range huddled down and another  mountain range spread out. A path was placed between where the mountains  ended and the mountains began. Once you’ve gotten past the narrow  passage, you would immediately be in the heart of the human empire. It  was a short path.</p><p>Even the humans knew full well of the shortness of this route. The  humans built fortresses within the gap between the mountains. The  fortresses blocked the ascending path by two layers. If one planned to  cross over the mountain pass, which was neither plains nor  mountains, one had to go through 2 strongholds. It was a short but  difficult path. However, what lied waiting ahead past the mountain pass  was definite, and where to go after making one’s way through was also  clear.</p><p>The meeting was over. It was already the middle of the night when I had left the tent.</p><p>The moonlight was clear and permeated into the snowy fields. The  night sky and snowy fields embraced the lunar rays and illuminated the  distant mountains like twilight. The mountains were at the end of the  field.</p><p>I tried to fathom why Hannibal had gazed at the Alps and tried to  search for a path in an area that was not a path. The passage shall end  at the end of the mountains and another path shall spread out before one  afterwards. Hannibal most likely saw it as the end of an era and the  start of a new age.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Your highness.”</p><p>“Lord.”</p><p>“Master.”</p><p>Lapis, Farnese, and the witches approached my side. Seeing that I did  not respond to their call, they followed my gaze and stared at the  night sky. The eyes of the girls who were born and raised in a dark place were well adapted to the night and could see far out. To us, the night was more cozy and relaxing than the morning.</p><p>Finally, the witches knelt down first, Farnese bowed, and Lapis lowered her head.</p><p>Lapis then asked.</p><p>“Your highness, where are we going?”</p><p>While looking at the mountains, I spoke.</p><p>“To the Empire.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><hr><p>TL Note: Another vassal get. Well, actually, I guess it would be  ‘vassals’, now wouldn’t it? You guys also got a glimpse of Elizabeth, so  there’s that. <strong>Also, this is an important note, the way Humbaba  speaks is rather unique since she drags out the vowel sound of the last  word she says. That’s why you’ll see a ‘-‘ at the end of her lines  occasionally. She does it on and off depending on the situation. I  forgot to do this in previous chapters, but I will make sure to do it  from now on.</strong></p><p>Also, seriously, most complaints I’ve seen about DD seem to be things  that can be answered easily, so if you have something up your butt,  then feel free to drop by the discord server since most of the people  there will be able to answer your question.</p><p>Anyway, thank you for waiting patiently for this release.

The soldiers were afraid to advance&nbsp;through a place where nothing could be seen. The Gods are not allowing our passage……these words&nbsp;were spoken&nbsp;in whispers. We unpacked our gear&nbsp;near the mountain range. Lapis spoke.</p><p>“Your highness. This location is a renowned shrine and numinous mountain in the demon world, so it would only be appropriate&nbsp;to perform an ancestral rite to the Gods here.”</p><p>“Would it truly be right to perform a memorial service in the middle of a war?”</p><p>“There are many soldiers who entrust their psyche to the Gods. Console the bodies and minds of the soldiers, your highness.”</p><p>“Minds, huh……?”</p><p>I scratched my forehead.</p><p>“It’s bothersome since it feels like it may become a needless pretense. Omit the ceremony and only set the food for the ancestral rites. Do not gather the troops into one spot and regulate them inconveniently. Instead, be considerate and allow the soldiers to offer their prayers&nbsp;whenever they desire. Inform the soldiers that while my intention is to show respect to the Gods, I shall not submit to them. If they depend&nbsp;on the Gods with their minds, then during the times they are unable to see their so-called Gods, their minds will collapse.”</p><p>“This one will pass your highness’ command to Miss Farnese and it shall reach the captains from there.”</p><p>Lapis handled the matter rapidly. It seems she had already taken care of&nbsp;the preparations for&nbsp;an ancestral rite before&nbsp;we had embarked on our march.</p><p>The soldiers steamed white soybeans, ground it, and made it into soup. They then pulled out wheat and turned it into noodles. They were making&nbsp;chilled soy milk noodle soup.&nbsp;Demons believed that if they&nbsp;consumed white&nbsp;soy milk noodle soup&nbsp;while performing an ancestral rite, then their insides would become clear&nbsp;and their spirits would be&nbsp;cleansed. The less salty it tasted, the better it was as food for memorial ceremonies. The soldiers ate the bean soup noodles and prayed to the Goddesses. Following us, the peddlers and prostitutes also made noodles of their own. After having a taste of the bowl that was presented to me, the taste of the soup was pleasurable. A servant had chopped cucumbers and modestly placed it above the noodles, which made me wonder where they could have possibly acquired the cucumbers during this winter season. The servants believed the act of&nbsp;obtaining cucumbers and offering&nbsp;them to me contained their sincerity, so they were quite proud of themselves for it. It’s a relief that there were cucumbers……was what the servants said while beaming immaculately. The soy milk noodle soup was simple and clean. It felt like my internal organs were becoming clear. I experienced for the first time in my life the devotion towards ancestral rites, which I did not experience before,&nbsp;here in this world.</p><p>“With this, is the service over?”</p><p>Lapis responded.</p><p>“It would be&nbsp;better to capture a white horse from a good descent and drain its blood and then boil that clotted blood to consume. However, since there are centaurs participating in the war as our cavalry, we cannot sacrifice a horse.”</p><p>“Hm.”</p><p>Centaurs were demons with the upper bodies&nbsp;of humans and the lower bodies of horses. For a race of demons&nbsp;with&nbsp;handsome faces, their tool on their lower body was as large as a horse as well, so honestly, they were a cheat-like race. If we were to capture and drain the blood of an animal who had the same looking penis as they did, then certainly the centaurs would loathe the idea.</p><p>“I see your consideration is deep, Lapis.”</p><p>“It would also be fine to boil the clotted blood of dogs instead of a horse. Your highness, would it be better to capture the hunting dogs?”</p><p>“That is fine. Although it may be different if it was duck blood, clotted dog blood most likely would not taste good at all. Rather than that, this chilled soy milk noodles is refreshing. Let’s have this again later on.”</p><p>“If we pillage the human villages then we will be able to obtain something like soybeans as much as we desire. If your highness so wishes, then this one will prepare the dish for your highness even if it is not during an occasion such as an ancestral rite.”</p><p>“You’re terrifyingly bad at making food, so that kind of lip service is……”</p><p>“Could this one’s cooking be as disgusting as Your Highness’?”</p><p>“What, how could you call it disgusting?”</p><p>Although those words weren’t&nbsp;necessarily wrong, that was still going too far. It seemed Lapis also thought her comment was a bit harsh and fixed her words.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“That&nbsp;was a slip of the tongue. This one apologizes. Your Highness’ handmade food is not disgusting, but rather, it is poor.”</p><p>“If you’re saying that as a compliment, then you are also quite the mystery.”</p><p>My lover is truly a weird woman.</p><p>Referentially, Farnese’s cooking ability was also completely non-existent.</p><p>We all grew up eating the food made by others or the&nbsp;food we had picked up, which could not be dared to be called cooking, so the lord and his vassals were all pitiful. How fellows, who have never made themselves a proper meal in their entire lives, could walk forward while trying to go to war, was a mystery. If it was a farce, then it was a comedy. With&nbsp;these pitiable fellows gathered together, they discussed military operations.</p><p>The captains disputed on the difficulty of the siege.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Your highness. The Black and White Strongholds are impregnable fortresses that have been penetrated only 6 times in the past 1,000 years. Moreover, is the general protecting the rampart not the human from the House of Rosenberg? That House has had great commanders for&nbsp;generations.</p><p>— There was also a case where the stronghold did not fall despite the mobilization of&nbsp;40,000 troops, but our current military strength is merely 4,000. A siege would be incredibly difficult.</p><p>Ο</p><p>I took out my pipe and bit down on it.</p><p>“Do you think I came here unaware of the difficulty of this path? Would the castle gates open if we were to&nbsp;have another history lesson after having come this far? Put aside the things that are needless to say. I wish to hear your stratagems. Even if you are to make a foolish utterance, I will not punish you by military law, so do not worry. However, keep in mind that the keep you earn is a lot higher than you think. You will have to be brighter in strategy than a foolish lumberjack. If not, then, well……blood will flow from your necks.”</p><p>The captains gulped.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— That is, well. Although the enemy forces are relying on the rugged mountain terrain, it’ll be difficult for them to receive supplies because of that terrain. It would be fine for our troops to hold position on this vast field and relax, but the enemy soldiers will have to go on patrols frequently, furthermore, the walls are high so it’ll also be that cold……</p><p>Ο</p><p>I spat on the floor.</p><p>“Oho? Are you saying that we should wait patiently until the enemy forces run out of provisions? That is quite the splendid strategy and marvelous tactic. To be able to welcome an imperishable great commander such as yourself, my insides are trembling. Come here.”</p><p>I gestured for him to approach me with my finger. Following my instructions, the captain prostrated. I raised my bare feet on top of the captain’s back and declared sternly.</p><p>“Until this meeting ends, you’ll be my foot rest.”</p><p>The dwarven captain was close to tears.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Your Highness’ Royal Grace is immeasurable–……</p><p>Ο</p><p>Since a full grown dwarf was sniffling, there was nothing as extremely disgraceful as&nbsp;this sound of whimpers. The remaining captains could not dare to laugh, so only the edges of their mouths twitched. I glared at the captains.</p><p>“Listen carefully. Though the enemy’s fortress may be located on a rough mountain terrain, their back entrance is wide open. Their back gate is connected to the White Fortress, and the White Fortress is connected to the Empire,&nbsp;so there are no chances of their supply line being cut. I understand that you feel reluctant about performing a siege, but use your brains a bit, your brains.”</p><p>The captains glanced at each other.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— How about turning the witches into a detached force and assaulting the enemy supply lines? It will most likely be an effective attack.</p><p>— Although our infantry and cavalry may be nothing more than a total of 4,000 men, the number of witches we have is 50. Normally, an army that reached 30,000 soldiers would have around 50 witches, so our numbers may be small, but we are still a strong force. Please make active use of the witches. If our forces block the front gate of the fortress while the witches cut off the back path, the enemy troops inside the stronghold will be unable to move anywhere and lose morale.</p><p>Ο</p><p>I was in awe.</p><p>“It is quite beautiful to see fellows, who claim to be warriors, pass on all their duties to the witches. I should have utilized the money I spent on hiring you chaps to just acquire more witches instead, but it seems I&nbsp;had ended up doing something foolish. There is not a complete lack of logic in your words. However, do you think that a stronghold known as the front line which protects the humankind would not have any supplies in their reserve? No matter how little their supplies may be inside that fortress, it should be enough to keep their forces fed for 2 months, so what would we do during that time? If it is 2 months, then the enemy could easily organize auxiliary troops from the rear, however, we do not have any reinforcements, so what can we do? By the looks of it, it also seems like there are no brains inside those heads of yours, so what can we do about that as well?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I beckoned to them.</p><p>“Come here.”</p><p>The captains approached. The two captains laid on top of each other like a hamburger. Using those idiots as a chair, I sat on top of them. The captains groaned and endured the sensation of my sexy derriere.</p><p>“If you have no better plans, then just get on your knees. I will at least uphold the dignity of those who kneel down honestly.”</p><p><em>Cheoeok&nbsp;</em><em>(TL note: Kneeling sound effect)</em></p><p>All of the military officers gathered in the tent had lowered their bodies at once.</p><p>Were these not dubious fellows?</p><p>Solely Farnese kept her back straight. Even during a meeting, Farnese had a book open. The fingers clinging to the cover of the book were being brushed by the cold wind, so they had turned red.</p><p>“……”</p><p>Every time she flipped a page of her book with her cold hands, the air around the tent was emaciated by the sound of the paper. The captains and I watched Farnese as she flipped one page at a time. Farnese spoke frankly.</p><p>“Just rush in. There are no enemy troops in the Black Fortress.”</p><p>The captains glanced at each other with a doubtful gaze. I asked.</p><p>“Why would there be no one protecting the stronghold?”</p><p>“Margrave Rosenberg is a coward. Since it seems like it will be impossible to protect both, he will try to at least defend the other half. That is the fate of an old general. The margrave most likely does not have the military strength to protect both the Black and White Fortresses. He would want to hold the White Fortress at any cost……”</p><p>Farnese let out a yawn. Her words were indifferent so it was similar to the way she was flipping the leaves of her book, and it was lightly passed by like the pages being turned. I thought about the child who was unable to learn how to speak from people and had no other choice but to learn from books. I spoke.</p><p>“What makes you say that the military troops&nbsp;the margrave would have brought here are a few?”</p><p>“There are several reasons. Those multiple reasons would have fused into one. The margrave most likely wants to achieve vengeance against your highness while relying solely on his own powers. A foolish fellow.”</p><p>Farnese let out a dried breath. In the previous battle, the margrave’s troops were all slaughtered after having been deceived by us. Farnese was referring to the vengeance that had blinded him because of that.</p><p>“There is also a political reason. The margrave is the starting point of this war. By attacking your lordship, he presented the demons a justification to start a war. The humans who were swallowed up by this abrupt battle will most likely abhor the margrave……”</p><p>“So cleaning up after one’s own mess.”</p><p>“The margrave himself should be thinking along these lines, so he should feel pressured.”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>Margrave Rosenberg was the supreme commander of the northern region of the Empire. Despite that, what was the margrave doing? He had come to this location in order to block me, Dantalian, who was leading an army that&nbsp;barely reached 4,000 soldiers. In contrast, the Imperial Princess Elizabeth went to face Barbatos and Marbas. The roles were reversed.</p><p>There was only one conclusion. Although Margrave Rosenberg was the supreme commander, his position was endangered.&nbsp;The nobles did not follow him easily since they treated him with loathing. There may have been complaints from people questioning how the culprit behind the start of this war could go around acting like a general.</p><p>That was the reason. That was why the margrave was here. To achieve vengeance against me and reestablish his sullied reputation. A foolish fellow…… the words Farnese muttered were correct. Georg von Rosenberg was a fool.</p><p>“Therefore, Lord, be at ease and rush straight in. The Margrave most likely wishes to bring us in as deep as possible. The Margrave is aiming for the desperate measures of giving us the Black Fortress and luring us all the way to the White Fortress.”</p><p>“And you’re planning to go along with that plan, general?”</p><p>“The most dim-witted fish bites the bait and is caught by the hook. A slightly less dim-witted fish looks at the bait but disregards it and swims off. A wise fish bites only the bait while avoiding the hook, and escapes leisurely.”</p><p><em>Thud</em></p><p>Farnese closed the book she was reading. She gazed at me.</p><p>“However, this young lady is not a fish but a single shark. I shall drag the margrave in, hook and all, and tear him to pieces. Lord, leave your life to this young lady. This young lady shall offer the lives of thousands to your lordship.”</p><p>I nodded my head.</p><p>“Do as you wish.”</p><p>“This young lady shall carry out the task for only your lordship.”</p><p>The first stone was placed on the Go board.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The Northern Guardian, Margrave of Rosenberg, Georg von Rosenberg</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 2, Day&nbsp;25</p><p>The Black Mountains, White Fortress</p><p>Ο</p><p>“An urgent report from the Black Fortress! The stronghold was captured!”</p><p>The conference room froze because of the messenger’s report.</p><p>The captains glanced at each other with an anxious gaze. Only I was silently looking down at the Go board. Since the Black Fortress falling was such an obvious occurrence, there was no reason for myself to panic. I scolded them in a mock-serious manner.</p><p>“Oi, where’d my Go opponent disappear off to?”</p><p>“Ah. Yes, general.”</p><p>The captain hastily picked up his stone piece once more. Regardless, there was no sharp flavor. This is why youngsters these days…… Did they not know how to maintain their composure?</p><p>From start to finish, the captain was dragged around by me. Black and white stones were mixed together disorderly. The result was his defeat by a large margin. After obtaining my overwhelming victory, I spoke.</p><p>“It seems you lost because you panicked, and you are upset since you have lost.”</p><p>“Yes……”</p><p>“Do not be perplexed, gentlemen. The number of guards that were posted at the Black Fortress was at most 200. Is that not the fall of something that was already destined to fall? Do you not gain victory by getting rid of the stone piece that is necessary to sacrifice? If you try to protect everything, then you will lose it all instead. That is the same for war or Go. Keep this in mind.”</p><p>“Yes, general.”</p><p>The captains bowed their heads. The very sight of them lowering their heads was docile. How troublesome. These young’uns still lacked much vigor. In the past, I used to beat the commanders around and…… no, wait. Am I perhaps old now? Have I become an obstinate old man that showed dissatisfaction towards everything around myself? That could be a possibility. I started having very mixed emotions. One becomes senseless with age, huh? I should pass on quickly…… Except, that will be after I have killed Demon Lord Dantalian.</p><p>“Messenger. What were the enemy numbers? With what method did Demon Lord Dantalian capture the Black Fortress? Tell me everything you know.”</p><p>“General, the fog is so dense that nothing is visible. Other than the fact that the snowy fog is immensely thick, nothing else could be known. It felt like the enemy had about 2,000 soldiers, but it also felt like they had 4,000. However, it most certainly wasn’t 1,000 or 5,000. Regardless, it truly is difficult to be positive because of the fog. I heard the sound of gunpowder exploding in the distance and then the enemy forces invaded. Of course, the words that the enemy forces invaded is also uncertain since this one did not witness it personally.”</p><p>While being aghast, I muttered.</p><p>“I do not know who chose you as the messenger, but you truly are a splendid one.”</p><p>As if feeling much obliged, the messenger bowed his head.</p><p>“Thank you very much. This is the first time I have received such a compliment.”</p><p>“Speak honestly. After hearing that you were unable to see anything, I have become suspicious on whether if you had actually run away as soon as the fight started. Did you flee?”</p><p>“This humble one has an old mother back home, whom I am taking care of by myself, so I felt as if I shouldn’t die thoughtlessly……”</p><p>“Take him away to be lashed.”</p><p>The soldiers grabbed the messenger and left. The courier cried out, ‘General, General…!’, but of course, I did not pay him any mind. In the middle of the second round of Go against a captain, another messenger ran in and prostrated himself.</p><p>“An urgent report from the Black Fortress! The stronghold has been captured!”</p><p>“I already know, courier. Their numbers and through what method the fortress was captured, tell me everything you know.</p><p>The courier then exaggerated fluently.</p><p>“Yes. The enemy forces were&nbsp;as terrifying as the revival of an ancient demon. The armies that appeared through the snowy fog all consisted of trolls and ogres, which made it feel like giants were approaching us. While the soldiers on our side were scared out of their wits, a dragon flew at us and breathed fire. Although our forces struggled desperately, our military strength was at too much of a disadvantage so they were unable to hold on for even a moment and were defeated.”</p><p>After hearing the messenger’s words, the captains whispered to one another.</p><p>“If that’s true, then I think we should withdraw as well.”</p><p>“Even if we retreat, the dragon will catch up to us and we’ll be turned into grilled meat, so we should just sit here and die.”</p><p>“It’s more of a mythical scenery than a terrifying one, and it’s more of a fake scenery than a mythical one.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“……”</p><p>I had a splitting headache.</p><p>“……You imbecile. State truthfully. Are you saying all that right now after having actually seen it, or are you blabbering after having seen a delusion? Dragons have been extinct for centuries now, but through what method could Demon Lord Dantalian have possibly used to bring one here?”</p><p>The courier furrowed his brows.</p><p>“Honestly, when the fortress was assaulted, this one was taking a nap in the barracks so even I am uncertain on whether the things I had witnessed were reality or a delusion.”</p><p>“Are you interpreting your dream right now in this stern military affair? And are you also claiming that dream as your report?”</p><p>“Since this one believes it is true, this one does not think that it is too much of a hallucination. Referentially, is a person’s belief not what forms that person’s world? Because I believe that I have seen a dragon, then that dragon must exist.”</p><p>“This man. So if I were to believe that you are soon destined to die, then I guess you will indeed die shortly after.”</p><p>“Uh……”</p><p>The courier tilted his head.</p><p>“Although that seems logically correct, something seems wrong.”</p><p>“The thing that is wrong is your head.”</p><p>I snarled.</p><p>“Someone drag this fool away and punish him.”</p><p>The soldiers lifted the messenger up and dragged him out. The sound of someone being clubbed could be heard in the distance. While I was concentrating on the Go board and placing my stone down, the third messenger rushed in. The messenger knelt down as soon as he entered the meeting room.</p><p>“General!”</p><p>“……I will have no expectations so just speak however you want. However, it would probably be better to say nothing at all instead of speaking whatever you desire.”</p><p>“General–!”</p><p>From beginning to end, the courier shouted.</p><p>“The Black Fortress has fallen by the heinous demons of the enemy forces! Our troops had lowered their guards because they thought the enemy wouldn’t invade due to the fog, but they aimed for that carelessness! The enemy forces put a bit over 20 witches in the front and bombarded our walls, and while our soldiers were running about in confusion, the enemy troops climbed up the walls. Several of our men struggled, but the majority had run away. Furthermore, among the ones that had fled, most of them were unable to escape completely and were captured. General! The enemy infantry consisted purely of dwarves and their numbers were approximately 3,000 to 4,000 men, but their morale seemed to be high and they were all well equipped!”</p><p>Once finished with his report, the messenger lowered his head. It was truly a clean movement. The captains lowered their voices and muttered to each other.</p><p>“……That’s strange. That fellow clearly gave a proper report, but for some reason, it sounds like a lie.”</p><p>“The so-called Shepherd’s Law. If the first two tell a&nbsp;lie, then no matter how sincerely the third states the truth, it’ll seem like a lie. That’s why, while it’s important for a person to be sincere, they must also be first, or at the very least second. This&nbsp;is important as well.”</p><p>“I have never heard of a law with that kind of name in my entire life. Are you sure that’s not some law&nbsp;that you randomly made up?”</p><p>“Hey, don’t accuse an innocent person……”</p><p>These guys, I told them to not panic and ease their tensions, but it seems that they have let their entire heads go.</p><p>I let out a sigh and spoke.</p><p>“Gentlemen, listen well. According to the reports from our scouts, the enemy army has about 3,000 to 4,000 soldiers. This location is absolutely not the main effort of the Demon Lord Allied Forces. Their goal is to grab our attention with the use of a separate attack unit. Do not be disturbed, and do not be blinded.”</p><p>“Yes, general.”</p><p>The captains courteously lowered their heads. I continued.</p><p>“Gentlemen, personally patrol the walls and reassure our military personnel. Our men are frigid because of the weather, so their hands should be cold. Switch their duty rotations frequently, and prepare hot water within the quarters regularly.”</p><p>The Black Fortress was captured, but what about it? There was no problem in the strategy I had planned out. If anything, it would be fine to judge that everything was going smoothly. I contemplated while preparing to write a report.</p><p>Demon Lord Dantalian will now pass the Black Fortress and advance further into the mountain pass. Their supply line will lengthen in consonance with that. Additionally, forests were luxuriantly spread out on both sides of the road. The optimum location to hide an ambush. If they were to try and invade thoughtlessly, then most certainly, the ones to die will be on the Demon Lord’s side.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>This mountain passage was like a Go board. The Black Fortress was the upper side while the White Fortress was the lower side, and the entire mountain pass was spread out as the face of the battlefield.&nbsp;A single line of a stronghold rampart was merely increased by another line, and yet the battlefield was expanded to a high and low. Surely, the ancestors who had built these walls in this location must have had foresight.</p><p>……The thing that I am worried about was not our front. There were no problems ahead of us.</p><p>If anything, the complication was behind us. Whether if the Imperial Princess Elizabeth was going to properly provide us with supplies or not……</p><p>His&nbsp;Majesty the Emperor had appointed me as the supreme commander of the northern armies. However, the nobles of the Empire had sworn their loyalty to the Imperial Princess. There was no prestige or dignity from the certificate of appointment given by the Emperor. It was a tragedy.</p><p>The Imperial Princess considered me as a nuisance. There was more than enough of a possibility for the supplies to be delayed. I had to obstruct the Demon Lord in front of me, and at the same time, I had to keep in check the Imperial Princess behind me. For myself to be in a war where I was surrounded on both fronts, just how did it become like this.</p><p>I recalled the words the Imperial Princess had spoken to me.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Sir Rosenberg, do you not think that the majority of the conversations we have shared can be condensed into more simple terms?</p><p>—&nbsp;Habsburg grants their faith&nbsp;a single time.</p><p>Ο</p><p>“……”</p><p>The image of the Imperial Princess, peeling off the skin of an alligator, filled my mind. A cold sweat went down the back of my neck. Being careless with the Imperial Princess was not an option.</p><p>From now on, the Imperial Princess will most likely gain complete control of the authority in the Empire. The thought of submitting to the Imperial Princess in order to establish a livelihood and the thought of refusing to bow to the Imperial Princess&nbsp;since my body had already pledged fidelity to His Majesty the Emperor, clashed against one another. The former rigorously encouraged one’s livelihood, while the latter solemnly&nbsp;advised loyalty. I was more concerned about the home front that was glaring at us from behind than the enemy forces that were approaching us from ahead.</p><p>Our great ancestors had raised two sets of walls and given us humans freedom, however, it felt like all the liberty in the world was the freedom of the enemy and the freedom of the Imperial Princess. That was so. This place was where I was going to be laid to rest.&nbsp;By breaking through this location with my bare body, was when I will finally be able to survive with my life.</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>I gulped. With the sick sensation that felt as if something was caught in my throat, I wrote the report.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— 2nd month, 25th day. Enemy forces have captured the Black Fortress. Military strength approximately 3,000. The commander is Demon Lord Dantalian. Our forces are stationed in the White Fortress and are&nbsp;perfectly secured. We are abundant in provisions and have a sufficient number of arms. The fog is severe.</p><p>Ο</p><p>And then, with the intention of warning the Imperial Princess, I added another line.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— The mountains are safe.</p><p>Ο</p><p>……Good. Even the Imperial Princess&nbsp;should be able to understand with this.</p><p>After passing the report to the postrider, I gazed outside the window. The Demon Lord will advance through the mountain pass covered in pure white snow.</p><p>Come, Dantalian. Come quickly. I shall sever your neck and satisfy my grudge……</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st,&nbsp;Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 2, Day&nbsp;25</p><p>The Black Mountains, Black Fortress</p><p>Ο</p><p>Our forces had occupied the Black Fortress before a&nbsp;period of having a single meal. Farnese was right. There were barely any troops within the stronghold.</p><p>It was barely 200. The majority of them were captured as prisoners. Claiming that this was too insipid, Humbaba complained.</p><p>“Tsk–. I thought we were going to be able to smell some blood after such a long time, but we drew a blank. Why did those shitty humans surrender after barely even fighting–?”</p><p>“Are you bored since you were unable to fight intensely?”</p><p>“A frustrating feeling like feeling—?”</p><p>Humbaba pouted her lips. I responded.</p><p>“Then burn them.”</p><p>“Yes–?”</p><p>“Do we not have a lot more than 100 prisoners? Bring the other witches and take 50 prisoners to burn as you desire. The most entertaining scenery in the world is watching fire, so your stress should dissipate a bit.”</p><p>Humbaba tilted her head.</p><p>“……But they’re nice enemy soldiers who surrendered obediently–?”</p><div></div><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Since they gave up obediently, then I guess they will die obediently as well.”</p><p>“……I don’t really know if that’s okay–?”</p><p>“I plan to go and greet the margrave tomorrow.”</p><p>I picked up some snow that was mixed with mud and tossed it in my mouth. I scrutinized the unpleasant taste of the dirt and the fishy smell of the snow with my tongue. Despite being considered as a renowned shrine and numinous mountain among the demons, the dirt and snow did not have any distinct taste in particular. I spat the mud out.</p><p>“In the past, since the margrave had come and gone from my stone cavern, we had become acquainted. Now, since I have arrived at the margrave’s stone walls, it is only natural for me to give him my greeting. However, it seems I regrettably do not have a present to give him.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“I feel as if 40 heads should be roughly enough to express my sincerity. What do you think, Humbaba?”</p><p>“—Ahahah.”</p><p>Humbaba twisted the corners of her lips. Ahah, ahahah…… Humbaba put her cone hat securely on her head and laughed flatly. The pitch black brim of her hat covered Humbaba’s face.</p><p>“Really, our master knows his stuff.”</p><p>“Burn them earnestly.”</p><p>“Oh. Us witches are the greatest experts in burning people to death. A person who has eaten a lot of meat knows well, and people who have had their flesh singed a lot can also burn things well. You’ll be stifled, master. It’ll be fine if you look&nbsp;forward to it–.”</p><p>The humans were set ablaze while they were still alive.</p><p>While looking down at their bodies burning from their leg up, the humans screamed. It was a wail that was like they were vomiting out their twisted intestines. We hung the corpses that were burnt pitch black on the ramparts. Similar to their last cries, their corpses were twisted bizarrely as well.</p><p>The witches devised a game. It was a sport to throw stones and hit&nbsp;the corpses. 1 point if you hit the body, 2 points if you hit the head, and 3 points if you hit their balls. Players who hit the balls three times in a row were gifted 10 extra points. The witches under my command were geniuses.</p><p>Farnese and I watched the humans burn and their bodies being played with. The sound of the witches’ giggling echoed throughout the area. The smoke blackened the corpses and the white snowy fog mixed into it. That side of the fog, where the whereabouts of the smoke disappeared, suddenly felt like nirvana. Once the laughter of the witches stopped, Farnese spoke.</p><p>“Lord. Do you perhaps know which army had captured the Black Fortress the fastest in the entirety of history?”</p><p>“I am not interested in history, so I do not know that well.”</p><p>“The answer is the revolting army of the Habsburg Empire. After starting a rebellion in the northern region, they assaulted the Black Fortress from behind. They say it took them 15 days to capture the stronghold, and this was an enduring record that was unable to be broken for the past 313 years.”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>“When your lordship brought this young lady back from the slave market, you told her this; that you will make this young lady’s name remain in history.”</p><p>I had certainly spoken those words.</p><p>I had put out a hand of temptation towards Farnese who was trapped within an iron cell and depending on the moonlight to read her history book.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—&nbsp;You’ll shine brighter&nbsp;when holding the&nbsp;baton in a battlefield than you would reading books. I’ll make it so that history will remember your name……</p><p>Ο</p><p>At the time, Farnese had looked up at me with a doubtful gaze. She was a child who did not know how to smile. Now, after half a year, that girl had become a conqueror.</p><p>“Indeed, your lordship was correct. On this day, we have captured the Black Fortress, which had once withstood the revolting army for half a month, within merely half a day.”</p><p>Farnese grinned eerily.</p><p>“It seems this young lady has already left her name in history.”</p><p>Her smile was colder than the winter.</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Ack, Ahah—!?”</p><p>I violently rubbed the crown of Farnese’s head. Although Farnese was a girl who put her emotions at the very bottom of her unconsciousness, only her crown was squishy. Farnese squirmed while waving her arms due to my touching divine help.</p><p>“Trying to brag after having captured merely a single wall.”</p><p>“L-Looord. I told you I hate it there……Hoah……”</p><p>“There is a ranking even among the great individuals who leave their names in history. Since you were born as a heroine, you should be aiming for the position as the 2nd greatest personage in history, so why are you pettily being satisfied by a single rampart? For starters, properly learn how to give an oration from Lapis, and then I will provide you an appropriate position.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Ah, understood. I understand, lord……”</p><p>Farnese dwindled down.</p><p>Traditionally, people must learn to be modest.</p><p>Ο</p><p>♦</p><p>Ο</p><p>Before we advanced to the White Fortress, I took a look around our military with Lapis.</p><p>Peddlers and panders had spread out a market area below the rampart. In order to avoid even the slightest bit of the winter wind, people stuck as close to the wall as possible. They appeared like the clams which attached themselves to the boulders in the&nbsp;ocean depths, and it felt like the fishy smell from the sea was emanating from there as well. I uttered.</p><p>“Let us go. I wish to see how the people live their lives.”</p><p>“Why would your highness go to the corner where the lowly people dwell……?”</p><p>Lapis bowed her head.</p><p>“I want to see it, that is why.”</p><p>“This one is afraid your highness’ grace will be sullied.”</p><p>“Stop your nagging and guide me.”</p><p>I patrolled the simple marketplace. The demons watched me from afar. When I looked at them, each and every one of them was in rags and had mud smeared on their faces.</p><p>Below the wall, goblin children were throwing stones at the human corpses. It seems they were imitating the game which the witches were playing earlier. When I drew near, their parents appeared out of nowhere and hastily carried their children away. Their own world was already established there.</p><p>“It seems they had set up a world of their own in a corner away from home within a single day. Those people……”</p><p>“Should we track down the ones who have run away and interrogate them?”</p><p>“It’s fine. Would they not run more if you interrogate them? If they run, would you not be unable to see the end? Leave them as they are.”</p><p>Their vitality to establish a world of their own was simply unpleasant to me.</p><p>Burnt human corpses were dangling from ropes on the wall. Below the rampart, the demons were rubbing their scrawny bodies against each other. The blackened flesh burnt by flames and the thin dried skin from the people should at least be narrowly divided by what was dead and alive, and yet, it felt like life and death were not separated in that world of theirs. But by all means, I was not vastly unknowledgeable in the fact that that indistinguishability&nbsp;was what life and death were.</p><p>Ο</p><p>My father died in prison. It was a heart attack.</p><p>He had tried to write a couple of lines for his will, but he had fallen before being able to write a single line.</p><p><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/fathers-will.png?w=700\"></p><p>That was my father’s will.</p><p>I had crumpled the note and stuffed it into my pocket.</p><p>My mothers and siblings rushed to me and asked if my father had left a will. I flatly told them, ‘There was no will.’. Instead, he left an inheritance. The dozens of trillions of won was in their possession. Before the deathmatch that was going to be carried out during the funeral, they were jumping for joy.</p><p>……Oh, young master. Thank you very much, young master, my mothers would say and lowered their heads. My siblings called me ‘elder brother’ and bowed deeply. The people who had arranged my kidnapping were among them as well. Since it was family that had tried to kill their ‘Young Master’ and ‘Elder Brother’, there was nothing wrong if I were to brush away that family. I chuckled. Try to live as pleasantly as you can. I’ll watch to see how well you all do……</p><p>Like so, I had tried to hide from the world, and yet, another world ended up appearing on its own. Now&nbsp;I was unable to tell whether if the world was insane, I was insane, or the both of us were insane. Furthermore, it was a world that was going to be destroyed if left alone, and it was a world where everything, including the demons latching onto to the wall like clams, Lapis, and Farnese, was all going to disappear. A certain malicious intent hovered over the fact that a world that was going to die was given to myself who had thrown away the world.</p><p>Was this God’s intention? I asked. Was this the goal of the Heavens……? The most believable hypothesis was that everything was a part of my father’s ill-tempered joke in order to ruin my life once more. Since there was no God, Heaven’s Will, or even my father in this world, this all depended on how I looked at it.</p><p>Very well then. I will wreak havoc. I shall save the world of these people, and after I have salvaged this world, that is when I will contemplate on whether if I will decide to take care of the people, rule over the people, or become a gentle lord. For now, does salvaging not have the most urgent priority? Even if hundreds of thousands of people were to die by war, was that not better than the entire world being annihilated?</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ο</p><p>“Your highness. The weather is frigid. Please go inside and get some rest.”</p><p>I turned my head. There, next to me, was the girl who had become one of the reasons why I had to save this world.</p><p>“Are you cold?”</p><p>“This one is alright. This one had slept in the open during colder days before.”</p><p>“I am also fine. Would we not be separated once we go to war tomorrow? I wish to be with you a bit longer.”</p><p>“When your highness says those kinds of words, does your highness’ tongue not go frantic because of how disgusting it feels?”</p><p>Lapis looked at me as if she was looking at a bug.</p><p>“This one is sometimes startled by your highness’ behavior. Please be discerning.”</p><p>“And how would I live without you?”</p><p>“For someone who has been living fine without this one, your highness sure worries……”</p><p>“Are you not afraid of the fact that I will be able to continue living on even if you were completely gone?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“If possible, do not die. Be careful and be careful again. Cherish your own life over mine. You&nbsp;are the last remaining piece of mind left in me.”</p><p>Lapis let out a sigh.</p><p>“This one has always been a part of the group of individuals&nbsp;who only care for themselves. Put away your concern, your highness. It is hard to handle and it is disconcerting to hear. Please keep in mind the wisdom of bringing our&nbsp;bodies close while keeping our minds at a fair distance.”</p><p>“Yes. That’s right, isn’t it?”</p><p>Lapis and I followed along the rampart and walked forward.</p><p>Now that I thought about it, we have never had the separate opportunity&nbsp;to enjoy a date.</p><p>If that was the case, then this was our first date, and yet out of all the&nbsp;locations in the world, our date course was a&nbsp;wall with a bunch of burnt corpses hanging off of it. What kind of elegant date was this? Be it romance or something else, there was nothing here at all.</p><p>The vastly stretched&nbsp;mountain range—a rampant connected by segments—the ropes hanging the corpses—and even the will that my father was unable to complete, like a road that was erased midway through, it felt as if it was rattling on gloomily saying that everyone&nbsp;will end up like this as well. Since this felt like a date course that rather befitted the two us, I chuckled to myself. Lapis gave me a weird look.</p><p>In the path that we had gone past, the young goblins gathered once more. I could hear the sound of stones hitting the wall.</p><p>After listening carefully, their total score was 3.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The Northern Guardian, Margrave of Rosenberg, Georg von Rosenberg</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 2, Day&nbsp;25</p><p>The Black Mountains, White Fortress</p><p>Ο</p><p>I went up to the upper story of the fortress gate and looked down onto the field.</p><p>The enemy forces were setting up camp in a location far away from our fortress gate. A black flag was waving in the mountain pass. Demon Lord Dantalian was using a black flag to represent his own troops since he did not have his own&nbsp;emblem. The Demon Lord of the black flag had arrived at the Black Mountains and captured the Black Fortress…… For a coincidence, it was a rather humorous one.</p><p>The captains measured the enemy army with their eyes,</p><p>“It appears like they have a bit under 3,000.”</p><p>“It doesn’t seem like there is a huge difference in numbers compared to our troops. We shall protect this spot with ease.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>I nodded my head. The problem was the number of mages. Last autumn, Dantalian had led over 11 witches. He most likely brought a considerable number of witches this time as well. There was a need to oppose that.</p><p>I had spent the money, which could have been used to buy infantries, to hire more mages. Our forces had 25 mages. It was an impressive number. This was more than enough to defend against Dantalian.</p><p>“General, look over there.”</p><p>In the location where the captain was pointing, the enemy dwarves were building something. It was a self-assembled catapult. Assuming that they were trying to siege us with that garbage, the captains laughed in ridicule.</p><p>“Hah. Would they even be able to toss a rock this far?”</p><p>“They used their heads a little, though. Dragging a large catapult into this path would be impractical, so an easy to assemble one is…… Well, it’s still&nbsp;useless even if they do that, but their&nbsp;efforts are praiseworthy.”</p><p>Moments later, they had begun to launch something with the catapults. Something that appeared to be lighter than stone, either collided against the rampart or landed on top of the wall. A captain went to pick one of the objects up and brought it back. The captain hesitantly presented it to me.</p><p>“General, this is……”</p><p>A head.</p><p>The half burnt head of a corpse.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“……”</p><p>The corpse’s face was twisted fiendishly.</p><p>It was the face of a person who had suffered until the moment of their demise.</p><p>The enemy had burned the prisoners alive.</p><p>My hands trembled when I thought about the penitence that the prisoners must have experienced.</p><p>“Those, shameless devils……”</p><p>I knew.</p><p>I was already aware that Dantalian was this kind of person.</p><p>But there was no need to go out of his way to burn them. He could have beheaded the prisoners cleanly,&nbsp;ensuring that they would suffer the least amount before they died. Despite that, he had purposely utilized the most painful execution method. Just to insult me.</p><p>After catapulting over 30 heads, the enemy catapults stopped. Then, six cavalries approached from the enemy camp and stopped at the fortress gate. They were holding a white flag which represented ‘negotiation’.</p><p>“……Open the gate. I will go out personally.”</p><p>“Would it not be dangerous, general?”</p><p>“If something happens to me, then immediately fire the arrows and kill them. Order the crossbowmen to be ready to fire.”</p><p>The chief gatekeeper opened the&nbsp;gate.</p><p>Once I passed the iron gate, the enemy cavalry was standing right in front of me. Among them, a man wearing a black mantle bobbed his head at me.</p><p>“It has been a long time, Margrave. No, should I call this our first encounter? I am Demon Lord Dantalian. I am honored that you did not disregard the negotiation and came out to meet with us in person.”</p><p>“A man who does not know his manners……”</p><p>So this man was Dantalian. I could not see this fragile looking spineless fellow as a monarch. If I were to wield my blade and charge at him, then killing him immediately should be possible. After readying myself to pull out my sword at a moment’s notice, I spoke.</p><p>“Oh, Demon Lord. You must have sincerely come here prepared to die. What is&nbsp;your ulterior motive to have requested a negotiation right after having flung the corpses of the prisoners at us? Tell me the reason why I should not cut your throat right this instant.”</p><p>“You are being rather aggressive. That was merely a small gift since we are not individuals who keep a distance between one another, after all……”</p><p>Dantalian laughed.</p><p>“You have destroyed my Demon Lord Castle, and I have now arrived at your walls. I would be ashamed to come here empty handed. Did you like my present?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Aha. It seems you were not that satisfied.”</p><p>Dantalian slightly glanced up at the wall. The crossbowmen were aiming their weapons at Dantalian there. If I ordered them to, then they will immediately fire their bolts and penetrate Dantalian’s throat. He should not be unaware of this fact, and yet, Dantalian was still smiling.</p><p>“That is fine. I had prepared more gifts just in case you were to make a fuss. Look.”</p><p>Dantalian turned his body and gestured towards his camp. In that location, dwarves were hammering wooden pillars.</p><p>Soon after, over a hundred columns were erected. My eyes went wide the moment I saw what was tied to those wooden pillars. A prisoner was bound to each&nbsp;column. The dwarves approached the pillars with a torch in hand. It appeared as if they were planning to immediately set the humans on fire. The prisoners wailed.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Save us! General……</p><p>— Please don’t throw us away……</p><p>Ο</p><p>My hands trembled. Was that the deed of a man? Did the demons not refer to themselves as demonkind and boast as being humane? Despite that, are you telling me that they can commit that sort of deed without any hesitation?</p><p>“You bastard……”</p><p>“Please order your crossbowmen to lower their weapons. I am a petty man with a lot of cowardice. Whenever someone threatens me, my body aches and my flesh trembles, making it difficult to breathe.”</p><p>“Is that so? Bask in your last breath in this life as much as you can. After I have slit your gullet, you will long for that breath once you are in Hell.”</p><p>“Ooh. Terrifying. How very terrifying. By the looks of it, it seems the margrave has a natural talent in threatening others.”</p><p>Dantalian raised his right hand.</p><p>“—Unfortunately, that is a talent that I have never obtained.”</p><p>At that moment, one of the pillars was set on fire. The column must have already been smeared in oil as the flames had begun to rise instantly. While looking down at the fire that appeared like the maw of a beast approaching them, the prisoner screamed.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Aaack! Aack, Aaaaaaaah……</p><p>Ο</p><p>At once, the flame swallowed the human body. The prisoner struggled desperately as they burned. Save me, please save me, once these cries ceased, only smoke rose up from that spot. Towards myself who was unable to open his mouth, Dantalian spoke.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Margrave, let us be honest.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“As you have witnessed, I am a scum. Garbage, if you insist. It is in my nature to treat the lives of humans lower than that of a fly. But what about you, Margrave? Are you not a governor who follows justice? Do you not cherish the lives of your subordinates as if they were your own children? I am this kind of person&nbsp;and the margrave is that kind of person. It is quite unfavorable for you to face a scum such as myself.”</p><p>I touched the hilt of my sword with the edge of my fingers.</p><p>“……What do you want to say?”</p><p>“Let us call a ceasefire.”</p><p>A ceasefire? How could he ask for a ceasefire? Unsure of what the other party’s true intentions were, I glared sharply at Dantalian. Dantalian spoke while digging his ear.</p><p>“Due to your splendid hospitality, I was able to acquire a bloodless victory. However, passing over the Black Fortress, I do not have the confidence in capturing the White Fortress as well. It is not as if I have a considerable amount of military strength…… Even if I were to overdo myself and attempt a siege, it is obvious that only my forces will suffer.”</p><p>“You know your place well, rookie.”</p><p>“You should also understand your place as an elderly man, Margrave. Does the back of your neck on your old bones not feel cold? You are in a situation where a young miss is pointing her sword at you, after all.”</p><p>“……What?”</p><p>“Do you not fear the Imperial Princess, Margrave?”</p><p>My mind went blank for an instant.</p><p>What was he talking about? What did I hear just now? What exactly did this man before me grasp in order to throw that sort of question? Dantalian snickered.</p><p>“The Emperor of the Habsburg Empire has already lost his authority. The Crown Prince is nothing more than dead wood, as well. As you are the last remaining loyalist, she is an individual that only the margrave, such as yourself, would fear. Would the Imperial Princess not desire to purge you when the opportunity presents itself?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“I am unable to capture your rampart. Be that as it may, Margrave, it would be foolish for you to leave your stronghold and attack me since that would mean you would be performing a pitched battle while leaving aside your safe walls. In conclusion, both you and I can do absolutely nothing and simply stand here face to face. This is quite the fateful relationship we have. Our destiny.”</p><p>Dantalian’s voice felt like it was being whispered directly into my ear, and pulled me in. I now understood what it meant to be lured in by someone’s voice.</p><p>“By seizing the Black Fortress, I have piled up enough contributions to not be ashamed in the eyes of the other Demon Lords. You as well were able to prevent the White Fortress from being taken away, so that is the same as being able to save face. Since one hand washes over the other, a good thing is a good thing, so this is more than sufficient for you and me to become close friends.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Margrave. I am a very liberal person.”</p><p>Dantalian smiled smoothly.</p><p>That smoothness made my blood freeze. The very fact that a wicked man was capable of smiling like that felt like an insult to the Gods and the disgrace of the world. That man was bragging as if he had already stolen something which must never be stolen. What is that? What are you telling me that is?</p><p>“If you agree to the ceasefire with us, then I will more than gladly let the prisoners go. A single person each day. Respectfully. Not the burnt heads of corpses, but humans who are in perfect conditions from their head to toe, I shall send them as so.”</p><p>I clenched my teeth.</p><p>I understood. This man before me was the Devil.</p><p>On that day, the day my subordinates were slaughtered on a&nbsp;hill, the apparition I had seen was not a simple illusion. The form of the Devil that appeared on the hill represented Dantalian. I muttered.</p><p>“……By some chance, rookie.”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“By some chance, if I were to behead you right here.”</p><p>I gripped the hilt of my sword.</p><p>Dantalian gazed at me.</p><p>“At that time, what sort of expression will you have on your face?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>As if surprised by my words, Dantalian opened his eyes wide. He then raised his head up and burst into laughter. The sound of the Demon Lord’s laughter stretched throughout the dry winter sky.</p><p>“That’s right, isn’t it? Aah. Of course, I am not omniscient and omnipotent. There is a chance that I could have judged a person wrong. There is a chance that you, the margrave, are capable of disregarding the sight of your subordinates being burned to death and take my neck. Yes, that is more than possible……”</p><p>Dantalian stuck out his head. Since his neck was long like a snake, he pushed his head right in front of my face.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Then go ahead and kill me.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Let us fall to Hell together, Margrave.”</p><p>He was serious.</p><p>This man, was saying that sincerely.</p><p>“People often say that Hell is a place that is forever burning in flames. However, that is incorrect. If Hell does indeed exist, then it is a winter landscape where everything is frozen. I have no doubts about it. A plain where the winter continues on and on until you forget that it is winter, forget that you are frozen, and finally, you forget yourself entirely. Absolute nothingness will engulf&nbsp;us. Would it not be lonely to fall into such a place by oneself? Let us go together, Margrave. Let us disappear eternally……”</p><p>I was barely able to prevent myself from taking a step back.</p><p>This person’s eyes were not normal. I thought that it was simply black, but inside those black eyes, a blood crimson color was flowing. The smell of blood emanated from his gaze.</p><p>Demon Lord.</p><p>Was this what a Demon Lord was?</p><p>Somewhere, in some other place, I had seen eyes similar to these, but it did not cross my mind easily. I could not grasp where I had previously witnessed these eyes.</p><p>“Hm……”</p><p>Dantalian narrowed his eyes. In an instant, the sanguinary in his gaze had vanished.&nbsp;The only thing that remained on his face, where lunacy had dissipated from, was a pleasant smile.</p><p>“That was just a joke. Do laugh, Margrave.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“In order to respect your personality, I shall release 2 prisoners each day. Since I am in the possession of 98 captives, then I guess that means the ceasefire shall continue for 46 days. They say that people become tied together by merely brushing the other’s sleeve, but the tie connecting you and myself is remarkable.”</p><p>After uttering ‘Hiyah’, Dantalian turned the head of his horse. Before departing, Dantalian turned to look at me and spoke.</p><p>“Oh right. Since 1 has already died, it’s not 98 captives but 97 now. I apologize. I have always been weak with arithmetic. It is my weakness. In truth, it is my only weakness.”</p><p>While laughing, Dantalian gathered his group and left. The centaur cavalry followed behind the Demon Lord. Among the cavalry, there was a demon with flowing pink hair squeezed in among them. That woman was most likely the half-breed succubus referred to as the ‘King’s Concubine’.</p><p>……Shoot them. Shoot them with reckless abandon.</p><p>I was unable to give this order to the crossbowmen. Even though my mouth was open, words did not come out. My subordinates, who were tied to the wooden pillars, were stuck in my eyes. I could not dare give the order because their wailing rang loudly in my ears.</p><p>And then I realized.</p><p>Which individual had the same eyes as that Demon Lord.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— You cannot buy my respect with fidelity. If you wish for me to respect you, then over all else, you must obtain victory.</p><p>— If by some small&nbsp;chance, you were to commit a mistake…… Well, I’ll most likely be very disappointed.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Aah.</p><p>The Imperial Princess. It was the Imperial Princess Elizabeth.</p><p>A person with the same eyes as her was within the Demon Lord army.</p><p>For what reason were people with the soul of the Devil surrounding me on both sides? Were the Gods trying to test me? A Demon Lord was closing in on me from the front as a single segment, and the Imperial Princess was pushing me from behind as another segment. In the center of that, I was unable to choose life or loyalty.</p><p>If I were to raise my troops to tear down the Demon Lord forces and cross over the Black Mountains in order to invade the demon territory, then that would be the path of loyalty that displays the dignity of Her Majesty the Imperial Princess. But I was uncertain&nbsp;about whether that would be possible.</p><p>This was difficult. As it was easy to throw away one’s life for fidelity,&nbsp;it was boundlessly easier to discard fidelity for one’s life, and yet, why was it so difficult to go down a&nbsp;path while holding onto both one’s own life and fidelity……</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><hr><p>TL Note: If anyone is curious about my translation schedule, I have none.

Seeing our return, the soldiers in our camp started to lower  the prisoners. I responded.</p><p>“Of course not. Even the margrave will be unable to hold out for more  than a couple of days and will soon leap out.  Since that man’s sense  of justice is strong, he will most likely be unable to withstand a  hoodlum such as myself.”</p><p>“But then why……”</p><p>“I can assure you that the margrave will raid us within 10 days. Is  Farnese not already waiting in ambush within the pine forest? All we  have to do is pretend to retreat and then proceed to completely  envelop the margrave.”</p><p>“This one understands your highness’ plan.”</p><p>We picked up the speed on our horses. Dust of snow arose from the  horses’ hooves. The frigid winter wind swallowed me whole. I enjoyed the  sensation that felt as if my body was becoming partially frozen. The  winter wind informed me that my body was still alive. I burst out into  loud laughter.</p><p>“Lapis. The margrave is a righteous individual. That sense of justice  turns him into a profound character. However, that profoundness of his  is thus his limitation. On the other hand, an unethical person is  shallow to no end, and due to that boundless hollowness, they have no  limitations. It is quite joyous that I am shallow! Can the margrave  manage my happiness? Can any of the righteous fellows in the world  handle me? It must be unfortunate for the people who are unable to cope  with my joy.”</p><p>“It must be nice to be cheerful, your highness.”</p><p>Lapis kept our horses close. She then spoke.</p><p>“Is your highness certain that the margrave will come out within 10 days?”</p><p>“Of course. I believe in that righteousness of his.”</p><p>“If that is so, then 20 prisoners will be sufficient.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“We do not have a reason to go out of our way to increase the number of prisoners and waste provisions.”</p><p>With the reins in my hand, I stared straight at Lapis. Lapis did not  blink her eyes even with the winter wind pushing against her.</p><p>“Lapis.”</p><p>“Yes, your highness?”</p><p>“If you die, then you will certainly go to Hell.”</p><p>“I see. That is why this one will not die.”</p><p>Lapis met my gaze.</p><p>“According to a certain someone, they claimed that this one’s life is  more precious than your highness’. Since it is such a valuable life,  this one must take good care of it.”</p><p>I couldn’t believe it.</p><p>I asked.</p><p>“Do you not feel pity for the lowly prisoners?”</p><p>“This one will not commit the mistake of taking the prisoners lightly  by pitying them. They are a group that can, at any time, attack this  one or your highness. Since this one understands and acknowledges their  strength, this one shall kill them.”</p><p>Lapis spoke flatly.</p><p>“In truth, is it not this one that is sincerely respecting the prisoners?”</p><p>Was there a way for me to not laugh in this situation?</p><p>While raising a blizzard behind us, we returned to our camp.</p><p>As soon as we returned to the unit, we beheaded 77 prisoners.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Blood Relative Killer, Imperial Princess of the Empire, Elizabeth von Habsburg<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 2, Day 29</p><p> Northern Region of the Habsburg Empire</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>— 2nd month, 25th day. Enemy forces have captured the Black Fortress.  Military strength approximately 3,000. The commander is Demon Lord  Dantalian. Our forces are stationed in the White Fortress and  are perfectly secured. We are abundant in provisions and have a  sufficient number of arms. The fog is severe. The mountains are safe.</p><p>Ο</p><p>For a long period of time, I gazed at the report that the margrave  had sent. Since I had examined it for a long time, I understood its  inner contents.</p><p>……So the margrave is afraid of me. Because he fears me, he is trying  to not reveal anything, and since he is trying to not reveal anything,  he had written information that is of no importance. Does the margrave  not know that by trying to not disclose anything, he is actually  revealing everything in detail? Is he trying to evade the immediate  threat by feigning ignorance? What was his true intention behind leaving  the report to a courier and not a mage, and having the message arrive  today when it was originally sent on the 25th……?</p><p>I tore the report apart.</p><p>These were not words. These were the grumbles of an old man. Words  should have been written on this paper, but since there were no words  and only repetition, the piece of parchment became junk. It has been my  long time habit to turn junk into trash.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>A cold sweat ran down the nobles’ necks as they watched me shred the margrave’s report. I spoke.</p><p>“Listen to this. The margrave claims that the mountains are safe. I  have given my faith to the margrave. What do you all think about this  matter?”</p><p>The nobles spoke together.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Do as your highness desires.</p><p>Ο</p><p>They were words that held as much meaning as having said nothing at all.</p><p>A chuckle flowed from my lips. The nobles flinched the moment I  laughed. I was unsure of the reason, but the people around me would  always be terrified whenever I laughed. It was a bizarre occurrence.</p><p>“I see that you all are unbecoming. Each and every one of you has a  head and mouth, and yet, how are your words one? Would it be appropriate  to call it the great joy of the Empire since the nobles  harmonize together as one? Would it be appropriate to spare a single  person, while taking the lives of the rest, since you all repeat the  same words anyway? It is a rather good idea since we will be able to  save on provisions as well.”</p><p>The nobles prostrated on the floor.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Please be discerning!</p><p>Ο</p><p>These fellows lacked even a grain of sense.</p><p>The three phrases that I despised the most in the world were ‘Your  words are immeasurable’, ‘I am much obliged’, and ‘Please be  discerning’. These were not words but hallucinations. No matter what I  said, they were immeasurable, obliging, and discerning, making it almost  difficult to tell what was which now. Therefore, whenever I heard those  three phrases, I interpreted it as a single line.</p><p>‘Please be quiet.’</p><p>If they are telling me to shut up then I shall do so. What else can I do?</p><p>I closed my mouth and walked out of the tent. The nobles quickly  stood up and chased after me. Since the nobles followed after me, their  attendants, knights, and knight subordinates all hastily accompanied us  as well, until finally, 200 people were following a single person. Even  though I did not utter a single word.</p><p>It was a comedic scene. Despite it being a humorous sight, no one was  laughing. Since everyone would be afraid if I were to laugh, I  refrained from doing so. I wanted to turn around and shout at the 200  people behind me. ……Laugh a little in your life. Laugh. Laugh I tell  you.</p><p>There was a time in the past where I had actually spoken these words.</p><p>In that moment, hundreds of low government officials forcefully moved the muscles on their faces and started to laugh. <strong>Ha, haha, ha, hahaha, ha, haha, ha, ha,</strong> all at once they uttered.</p><p>It was horrible.</p><p>Occasionally, that would appear in my nightmares.</p><p>After that day, I never gave the order to laugh ever again. It was  regretful. How could I have possibly hoped that people who could not  speak properly could laugh decently?</p><p>They were not humans but ghosts. They were individuals that lived as  phantoms and were going to meet their ends as phantoms. It was the way  of the world for them to live their lives as ghosts. Because I believed  it as so, I had no other choice but to leave them to their own devices.  To humans, words should exist as a method to release their inner minds,  and yet, humans used them to cover their minds and contort it, causing  their words to not retain a single portion of their true meaning or  contain the smallest amount of their emotions.</p><p>A plain was stretched out in front of the group of 200 people. There  were wooden columns planted into the earth here and there. Orcs,  goblins, minotaurs, and other similar demons were bound to the pillars,  one demon per column. They were the prisoners that our forces had  captured.</p><p>There was even a Demon Lord among them.</p><p>Rank 68th, Demon Lord Belial.</p><p>A detached unit, while doing reconnaissance, had encountered the  Demon Lord by chance and captured him alive.  Bound to the wooden  pillar, Belial glared at me. I did not use ropes to tie the Demon Lord  to the column, instead, I had nailed him to it. I had politely pinned  his palms, wrists, and ankles to the wood. Belial groaned in the demon  language while bleeding.</p><p>“……Curse you. Curse you all. You plague of the continent, the  Goddesses will never forgive all of you. Judgment shall fall on your  race which has trampled and burned our homes……”</p><p>The nobles muttered among one another behind me. They could not  understand the demon language. Well, they also did not know the Imperial  language properly, so there was no chance that they would know another  race’s language.</p><p>I took out a knife. It was a type of blade that was used when  butchering animals. After seeing the blade, Belial opened his eyes wide.  The Demon Lord muttered more desperately.</p><p>“Oh Gods, oh Goddesses, please, I beg of you to punish the ones  before me. Punish injustice with righteousness and return blood with  blood. As your weak servant, I humbly pray. Oh Goddesses, please……”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“That is useless.”</p><p>The Demon Lord turned to look at me.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I said that is all pointless, oh weak Demon Lord.”</p><p>“You, what are you…… no. How do you know our language……?”</p><p>“There is no yours or mine in speech. As a flower is still a flower  if it were to bloom in my garden, then even if a flower were to blossom  in yours, it is still a simple flower. I normally take joy in viewing  the flowers within my possession, so I do not dislike learning new  languages.”</p><p>Belial glared at me.</p><p>“What do you plan to do with me, human?</p><p>“I will take your life.”</p><p>I took out a whetstone and sharpened the knife. The vibrations that  came off the iron, while being sharpened by the stone, were transferred  to my palm. Belial watched the sight of me grinding my blade in mute  bewilderment.</p><p>“Do you see the banners that are waving on the other side of the  plains? That is the army led by Demon Lord Marbas. Trenches are dug  deeply in their front lines and wooden fences are set up, so their  defenses are not ordinary. Rushing in there and crushing them would not  be the most profitable tactic for us. That is why I plan to lure the  enemy here.”</p><p>“Hah. Sir Marbas leads the greatest cavalry corps in the demon world. He is not someone who would lose to the likes of you.”</p><p>“Pardon me, Demon Lord. Do you know who I am?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“It seems you do not. I assumed that you did since you had said ‘the likes of you’.”</p><p>“……And who exactly are you to be saying that?”</p><p>Good.</p><p>The blade was sharpened well.</p><p>I momentarily put the iron of the blade in a fire and heated it.</p><p>“My name is Elizabeth von Habsburg. There are a couple more names in  between, but I will omit those. Demon Lord Belial, albeit a short time, I  will be in your care. Over all else, I will be the last person you will  see in the final moments of your life, after all.”</p><p>“……!”</p><p>Marbas will most certainly be unable to hold still if his military  personnel were to witness a Demon Lord being skinned alive before their  very eyes. The demons will rage, and unable to restrain that wrath, they  will charge. They will kick aside their sturdy walls and safe trenches  to assault us.</p><p>It seems Belial understood what my intentions were as he had started  to struggle desperately. Of course, Belial, whose body was nailed down,  could not escape.</p><p>“No! Sir Marbas, do not come! Please leave me to my demise!”</p><p>“Give up. No matter how much you cry out, they are unable to hear you.”</p><p>“No! Aaack! You mustn’t, you bastard! You must not!”</p><p>“How troublesome.”</p><p>A type of person who did not know when things were futile.</p><p>I pressed my knife against the other party’s skin. The blade sliced  into the Demon Lord’s flesh smoothly as if it was butter. A cry erupted.  Aiming for the moment his tongue stuck out of his mouth, I severed the  end of his tongue. Another scream burst out. Belial’s cries had now lost  its form and had become merely wailings of pain.</p><p>I glanced at a mage. The mage nodded his head and furtively activated  a sound enhancement spell. From that moment on, Belial’s screams were  enhanced and thus resonated loudly throughout the entire plains. Every  time Belial’s finger or toe was cut off, our soldiers cheered.</p><p>It was around the time I had started to peel Belial’s cheek, the nobles shouted.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Your Highness, the enemy forces are moving. It’s Marbas’ flag!</p><p>— The enemy troops are carrying out a full charge!</p><p>Ο</p><p>The nobles blatantly pointed towards the front.</p><p>They were indeed right. The demon flags were fluttering violently.  The sound of horns completely filled that side of the plains. They were  preparing to charge soon. I cleaned the knife with a washcloth.</p><p>“Listen carefully. The enemy forces will be agitated so they will  assault us with reckless abandon. Do not pit yourselves against them  there. Drag them deep into our territory and envelop them. Constantly  beat the drums and blow the horns powerfully. Move quiescently while  making the enemy troops unable to regain their composure by causing a  commotion with the noise. Do you understand?”</p><p>The nobles pounded their chest with their right arm.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Yes, your highness!</p><p>Ο</p><p>The battle continued till the evening.</p><p>The enemy forces clashed against our defense line with their bare  bodies. The cavalry corps led by Marbas was powerful. However, their  cavalries were exhausted from having ascended the hill, had their pace  decreased by getting stuck on the wooden fences, were obstructed by the  spearmen, and were shot to death by the crossbowmen. The demons  attempted to charge 4, 5, and 6 times and fell to their deaths  repeatedly.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Finally, the enemy troops retreated. It was after they had failed to  break through our defenses for the 7th time. They were not as fast as  they were when they had first charged at us. I did not miss that  opportunity.</p><p>“Pursue them and tear them to pieces.”</p><p>Our knight corps rushed forward. Since they had sufficient rest, the  knights were full of vigor. The backs of the enemy were cut by the  blades swung by our knights. The enemy soldiers fell on their faces at  the descending portion of the hill. Half-corpses fell and tumbled down  the hill, and by the time they had reached the base of the hill, they  were already complete corpses. One after the other, half-dead bodies  rolled down the hill. The enemy’s retreat had changed into defeat.  Belial, who was hanging from the wooden pillar, had not died yet. He was  watching the battle that had turned into a slaughter with wakeful eyes.  With blood clogged in his throat, he wailed.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Aack. Uuuuaaaa……uuaaaah! Uuuuaaaack!</p><p>Ο</p><p>Later into the evening, sleet started to fall from the sky. There  were many enemy soldiers who had died on the hill while staring up at  the sky. They had died with their eyes and mouths wide open. Snow and  wind entered those opened gaps. Since the corpses had turned cold, the  snow did not melt and firmly rested on top of their bodies. Snow piled  up in the mouths of the corpses.</p><p>I slashed Belial’s neck and tossed his head into the snow. There were  so many heads buried in the snow that it was difficult to differentiate  the other heads from Belial’s. Although goblins, centaurs, and humans  all had different appearances, the form they all had after death were  nearly the same. So that was life. Lives were not the same because they  all lived, they were a single life because they all died the same……  Although lives were supposed to be able to understand each other due to  their fear and sympathy for death, since they were unable to experience  death in their lifetime, the demons and humans were, in truth, separated  and will most likely fight for eternity…… After gazing at the  decapitated heads buried in the snow for a period of time, I turned  away.</p><p>On my way back to my tent, nobles and soldiers were lined up on both  sides. They were all covered in blood. While I walked down the path,  they knelt down one at a time.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Your Highness.</p><p>— You are the victor.</p><p>Ο</p><p>At the end of the pathway, my brother was standing at the entrance to my tent. There was no blood on his armor.</p><p>Once I approached, my brother’s knights took a step back. I dusted the shoulder of my brother.</p><p>“It is a relief that you are unscathed, Your Highness the Crown Prince.”</p><p>My brother trembled.</p><p>“You…… you, are the Devil.”</p><p>“I know. Is there a problem with that?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“I asked if there is a problem.”</p><p>My brother lowered his head. He had muttered something in a low voice, but I could not hear him.</p><p>How pathetic.</p><p>Feeling pity for that petty pride and rebellious spirit, I  disregarded my brother and entered my tent. He was a man who could not  properly gaze at a person unless he had bedded them, anyway.</p><p>The maids approached to unclothe and clean my body.</p><p>While wiping my lower abdomen, the chief maid whispered.</p><p>“Your highness, a message has arrived from Demon Lord Paimon.”</p><p>“Put it away. I will listen to it later.”</p><p>The chief maid bowed her head.</p><p>With my now clean body, I sat down on a bookstand.</p><p>The winter wind seeped into my now cooled body. Since the tent was  unable to block the wind, winter was able to come inside in its  entirety. My head was clear. I thought about the report that the  margrave had sent and arrived at dawn.</p><p>…… The margrave was afraid of me. It would only be appropriate to  respect that fear. It was obvious for the weak to be terrified of those  they recognized as stronger than themselves. But for what reason did he  fear me, and yet, choose to not obey my command? Was it pride? What  meaning could come from an unhealthy pride? I could not understand. Was  it stupidity? Did I have to berate the stupidity of an old man? I was  not sure. Was it my own arrogance for having considered the other party  as a senile old man on my own volition? That was most likely it……</p><p>I picked up a quill and started to write. It was a single word.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Victory(勝).</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The Northern Guardian, Margrave of Rosenberg, Georg von Rosenberg<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 3, Day 1</p><p> The Black Mountains, White Fortress</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Victory(勝).</p><p>Ο</p><p>I became dumbstruck as if I had been hit on the head.</p><p>The message of triumph that the Imperial Princess had sent had only  the single word ‘victory’ written on it. Unable to figure out what the  Imperial Princess was trying to say, I pondered.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>……Was she telling me that she had won, or was she telling me to win?  Was she instructing me to submit since she had obtained victory? Did it  mean for me to distinguish who the victor was on my own? Was the  Imperial Princess the victor while I was the loser?</p><p>This single word contained all these meanings. The Imperial Princess  did not boast or brag about her accomplishment. She used her victory to  threaten and intimidate me. By establishing her victory as an example,  she was urging me to succeed as well. If it seemed like victory was out  of my reach, then she was advising me to submit to her. The pressure to  win pushed my body from behind towards the front where the enemy forces  resided, and the advice to submit pulled my body back towards the place  where our forces were holding out. The enemy and ally were clearly  different, and yet, I could not see the difference between being pushed  and being pulled.</p><p>The rightful ruler of the Empire was His Majesty the Emperor and the  rightful heir to the throne was the Crown Prince, and yet, the Imperial  Princess stepped on the Emperor’s dignity and laughed at the Crown  Prince’s authority. That precession of stepping and laughing was  exceedingly imposing. ……Was she telling me to join that procession? Was  that what victory(勝) meant? Was an old man struggling to succeed in his  late years what triumph means? Gazing up at the sky, I earnestly hoped  that my aged body would at least not be sullied.</p><p>I called the captains to my room and gave them an order.</p><p>“The army led by the Imperial Princess has won a huge victory in  their battle. Since the news of victory has arrived for us, the enemy  residing in the Black Fortress should soon receive a report of defeat.  Organize the troops in case the enemy attempts to withdraw.”</p><p>The captains lowered their heads.</p><p>“Do you plan to pursue the enemy now, general?”</p><p>“No. It is still deep in the night. Consider the possibility of being  ambushed if we were to chase after them in a hurry. Once dawn arrives  and the first rooster cries, spread out the scouts and then advance.”</p><p>“As you command.”</p><p>After sending the captains out, I got changed. A young lad assisted  me in putting my armor on. This lad’s father had always helped me put on  my clothes throughout his entire life, but last autumn, he had died  during the battle against Dantalian. The son inherited his father’s job  as if it was natural.</p><p>Different from his father, the son’s fingers were clumsy and awkward while  assisting me in putting on my gear. I could not blame him for that.  Although this lad considered it embarrassing to not be blamed, I  considered him being embarrassed to be boundlessly more humiliating.</p><p>“This is fine. I shall do the rest myself.”</p><p>“I apologize, your honor.”</p><p>“What is there to apologize for……? You can leave now.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>I firmly equipped the rest of my equipment and sat at the desk.</p><p>Since the Imperial Princess had generously written and sent the news  of victory, as a vassal of the Imperial family, I had to send a letter  of congratulations. Previously, I was barely able to write a couple of  lines, but this time, absolutely nothing came to mind.</p><p>……Your Highness the Imperial Princess, please do not kill your father  and brother, and do not insult them either. I request of you to not  throw away your filial piety.</p><p>When I was about to write down those lines, I clenched my fist  strongly. As soon as I thought about the Imperial Princess’ face, Demon  Lord Dantalian’s grin was situated there as well. My chest pounded. The  feebleness of my words smoldered into my bones.</p><p>How difficult this was.</p><p>Because of my old age, it seems I did not have the margin of power left in me to handle a single sentence.</p><p>I closed my eyes. With my eyes closed, I thought about the form of  myself giving a great appeal to the people of the northern region.</p><p>I attempted to picture myself approaching His Majesty the Emperor  after having repulsed the Demon Lord’s army and the Imperial Princess’  cabal, however, the only image that came to mind was solely that of the  Imperial Princess’ hands skinning the leather of the alligator. Just the  fingers covered in blood. At the edge of her hands, the leather was  skinned as if it was fated to be separated from the body since the  beginning of time. My body trembled because of that fluid hand  movement……</p><p>Where was that alligator captured from?</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 3, Day 1</p><p> The Black Mountains, White Fortress vicinity</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>An urgent message had arrived last night.</p><p>There was a code on the message that was difficult to decipher.  Looking into their crystal balls, the witches took out strokes from the  words.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I watched as the witches deciphered the report. As the strokes  gathered together and started to form coherent words, the witches’ gazes  shook. Humbaba read the lines out loud.</p><p>“……2nd month, 29th day. Complete defeat. Marbas’ 2nd army has been crushed.”</p><p>The complexion on Humbaba’s face as she turned to look at me was pale. I nodded.</p><p>“Do not stop. Continue reading.”</p><p>“……From the 15,000 chosen elite troops, around 9,000 remain. The  opposition is the alliance between the Habsburg Empire and  Polish-Lithuanian Kingdom. Approximate enemy military strength is  40,000. This is the Neris Plains. The enemy is infiltrating further in.  Ah! Marbas is a horse-headed bastard. I’ll get to the point. I will hold  out for 13 days. Dantalian, you pierce through……”</p><p>Humbaba gulped.</p><p>“That is all, master.”</p><p>I brushed my chin.</p><p>Complete defeat and crushed. These were heavy terms. Although  Barbatos was a girl who disorderly copulated with me and laughed  vulgarly, when the issue at hand was related to war, she became a  completely different person. Barbatos would never exaggerate words when  it involved war. Complete defeat and crushed. A bitter taste filled my  mouth.</p><p>“13 days, is it? Did Barbatos say that she will hold out for 13 days?”</p><p>“Yes, master.”</p><p>I felt like I could see Barbatos’ narrowed gaze from the fact that  she had informed me of the exact date. If it was 13 days, then that was  nearly two weeks, so it would have been fine to write two weeks.</p><p>Regardless, Barbatos stated 13 days. She had calculated the days she  could endure and the days she could not, and concluded it as 13 days.  However, it was no more or no less than that and was exactly 13.</p><p>True to their name, Barbatos’ first army and Marbas’ second army were  the main attack force of the Demon Lord Allied Forces. If they were to  collapse then this war would be completely over.</p><p>Barbatos instructing me to ‘pierce through’ meant that she was  requesting for me to attack the enemy allied forces from the rear, after  having penetrated through the White Fortress. We not only had to  capture the White Fortress, but we had to march all the way to the rear  of the enemy forces, so the 13 days deadline was barely 13 days. While  estimating the chances of succeeding in my head, I asked.</p><p>“Humbaba. How many days will it take for us to go north from the mountains and reach the Neris Plains?”</p><p>“Uh, well. If we move as fast as possible, then four to five days……?  That will be a really tough march. If we advance while crushing,  burning, and getting rid of the insufferable things in our path, then  around 10 days?”</p><p>“Since a day has passed, then by adding a day to that 10, that will  make it 11 days. If we include the days needed to march, then we must  immediately capture the White Fortress within 3, but if possible, 2  days.”</p><p>“Hii–, two days. Isn’t that really rough–……?”</p><p>The witches muttered in despair. Originally, our forces were planning  to conquer the White Fortress over the course of a week. Even a week  was a short amount of time to capture that stronghold. Since it had  become shorter than that, the witches were at a loss for words. Two days  from now was the day after tomorrow. It was obvious that the witches  would be troubled.</p><p>Despite that, I smiled.</p><p>The corners of my lips twisted on their own.</p><p>“—I see the heavens are helping us.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“Around this time, Rosenberg should be preparing for a running fight.  Since we have now received the report that the Demon Lord Allied Forces  were completely defeated, then the margrave should have received it  sooner. The margrave should already be awfully aggravated because of  what I had done, and since this favorable situation has piled on top as  well, the margrave’s bottom should itch so much that he will be unable  to stay still.”</p><p>I stood from my seat. After standing up, it felt as if it wasn’t the  margrave whose bottom was trembling, but myself. Well, what was so bad  about that? There was no one who would blame me if my sexy derriere were  to tremble a bit.</p><p>“Humbaba, go find and bring back Farnese from the pine forest. We  shall have a war council immediately…… no, never mind! I will personally  go to the forest. That will be faster. Will you give me a lift on your  broom?”</p><p>“Yes. This one’s broom will always have a vacant spot for you, master.”</p><p>The witches flew into the night sky while giving me a lift.</p><p>It was a beautiful night with sleet fluttering around. Every time the  moonlight collided against the small sheets of ice, the rays scattered.  A countless number of narrowly split moonlight fell down upon the  hundreds of thousands of pieces of snow. Although it was a dark night,  the darkness only loomed over the ground.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The witches set me down beside the pine trees. The entire  surroundings were still. Moonlight could not settle down in this pine  grove. Since 4 days ago, Farnese had led the cavalry here to lie and  wait in ambush.</p><p>Humbaba let out a long whistle.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Hwiiiiiiii.</p><p>Ο</p><p>The sound was soon consumed into the blizzard and disappeared into  the other side of the forest. Shortly after, while leaving a trail of  snow dust, a group of centaurs quickly approached us. The centaurs were  not wearing anything on top so their chests were bare. They recognized  who I was and lowered their front legs to give their greeting.</p><p>“Where is the acting general?”</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>I furrowed my brows.</p><p>An unpleasant chill sank into my spine.</p><p>“My general? Where is Farnese?”</p><p>Ο</p><p>♦</p><p>Ο</p><p>There was an icehouse at the location where the centaurs had led me.</p><p>Once I entered the igloo, I saw Farnese huddled in a corner. Even in  this forest, where the winter was fierce, Farnese did not wear a fur  overcoat. She only wore the military uniform made from cloth.</p><p>Whenever the soldiers saw Farnese like this, they would say that it  was because her father and mother had conceived her in the snow. The  soldiers believed that the cold must have seeped into the mother’s womb  and into the child’s bones, so Farnese did not feel cold even during the  winter. To the soldiers, the general was a girl born in the winter.  While shutting herself in the icehouse, Farnese mumbled in a voice that  could barely be heard.</p><p>“……ry……orry……ry……”</p><p>“Farnese?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Farnese froze.</p><p>Feeling that something was peculiar, I placed my hand on her  shoulder, and at that moment, a scream burst out. Farnese clutched her  head and lowered her entire body to the floor. Surprised by the sudden  reaction, I took a step back.</p><p>“I’m sorry…… I’m sorry, Father…… I’m sorry……”</p><p>I held my breath.</p><p>My head became cold.</p><p>My spine felt numb as if a current was flowing through it.</p><p>Farnese, unaware of the fact that I had arrived, continued to mutter.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Father. I won’t do it again……I’m sorry……”</p><p>These damned Gods.</p><p>Unable to listen any longer, I ran out of the igloo. If I were to  hastily approach a person in that sort of mental condition, then that  would only make the situation worse. The fact that I understood that  knowledge through experience, was the only reason I had to be thankful  to the Gods.</p><p>Outside the icehouse, hundreds of centaurs were lowering their front  hooves. The leader of the centaurs was kneeling at the front. Pointing  towards the igloo, I asked.</p><p>“Since when.”</p><p>My voice shook with rage.</p><p>“Since when has the general become like that?”</p><p>“Ever since we had set up an ambush camp in the pine forest……”</p><p>“What is the reason?”</p><p>“T-This commander does not know that well. The general is fine during  the noon, but strangely, she ends up like that during the night. It  seemed as if the Miss has an unnatural fear of the pine trees so we had  built that igloo. That’s why the situation had gotten a slight bit  better, but……”</p><p>“The situation got slightly better?”</p><p>I looked back and forth between the icehouse and the centaur.</p><p>“Are you telling me that the situation got better? That is better?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Tell me now. Are you kneeling down in order to beg for forgiveness,  or are you, by kneeling before me, requesting for me to cut your head  off?”</p><p>The centaur’s shoulders trembled.</p><p>“Y-Your highness. Please at least spare this one’s life……!”</p><p>“Why did you not tell me sooner?”</p><p>“The general entreated for us to never inform your highness, so……”</p><p>I unsheathed the long sword from my waist and severed the centaurs’  neck. Blood spurted out from his neck. Crimson blood sprayed onto the  pure white snow.</p><p>I looked around and spoke.</p><p>“I am your lord. Do not forget this.”</p><p>The centaur cavalry bowed their heads further. Leaving them aside, I  entered the igloo once more. Farnese was still muttering in a  voice mixed with weeping.</p><p>“Farnese.”</p><p>I approached Farnese and grabbed her head. I was barely able to establish eye contact with her.</p><p>“Farnese. It is me. Dantalian.”</p><p>“I’m sorry…… I’m sorry, I made a mistake……”</p><p>“I am not your father. Look carefully, Farnese. Look at me. I am not  your father. I will not hit you or violate you. I will not confine you  within a library and give you food through a hole in the door.”</p><p>I whispered desperately.</p><p>“I will not starve you just because you were disobedient. I will not  burn or tear apart the books which you cherish. Farnese, I am not your  father. I am Dantalian. Dantalian.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“……”</p><p>“You are no longer an illegitimate child bound by your family. No one  can confine you. You are here. You are my vassal. I am your lord.  Behold. As long as you do not betray me first, I will never abandon  you.”</p><p>The focus in Farnese’s pupils slowly returned.</p><p>“Lo……rd……?”</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>“T-The pine trees……”</p><p>Farnese shivered.</p><p>It appeared as if she had forgotten how to shed tears, so she could only cry with her voice.</p><p>“So many cicadas were attached to the pine trees…… they kept crying……  my father to this young lady…… this young lady, repeatedly……”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Was that it.</p><p>The tree that Farnese had seen through the window when she was young, was the same type of pine tree as the ones here.</p><p>I stared deeply into Farnese’s eyes.</p><p>“It is not the sound of cicadas. There are no cicadas here.”</p><p>“But, they keep…… the sound of cicadas, profusely……”</p><p>“That is not the sound of cicadas. It is the sound of snow. Farnese,  you are currently confusing the sound of snow as the cries of cicadas.  Due to your memories bound to the pine trees, those memories are causing  this mistake.”</p><p>“No, lord…… that’s not it…… that can’t be……”</p><p>“I will prove it to you.”</p><p>I grabbed Farnese’ wrist and dragged her. Although Farnese struggled  to not leave the igloo, I forcefully pulled her out. Farnese was aware  of who I was. That meant that there was not a complete problem in her  cognitive function. The moment her usual awareness and her confusing  memories ground against each other, that was the optimum opportunity. It  was during this moment I had to use her current perception to crush her  past memories.</p><p>The blizzard wailed as it blew through the pine trees. Farnese kept  her head down and tried to not look anywhere. I grabbed Farnese’s chin  and forced her to face her surroundings.</p><p>“Look before you. It is winter right now!”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“There are no cicadas. Those were all hallucinations that you had  created on your own. Do the sound of snow and the cries of cicadas sound  the same to you? Look carefully, Farnese. Open your eyes and behold  your surroundings clearly. You are 16-years-old. If you are 16, then you  are already a damn adult. How long will you moan because you are bound  by your mongrel-like father!?”</p><p>I met Farnese’s gaze once more. Farnese’s pupils were trembling.  However, they were not the shaking of eyes that were unable to see, but  the trembling of eyes that had yet to find their center.</p><p>“You are no longer the victim. You are the assailant. You are no  longer a part of the weak who are offended, but a part of the strong who  offend. If someone tries to take your life, then kill them before they  can get to you first. It is simple. If that someone is your father, then  kill your father, and if that someone is God, then kill God as well.”</p><p>“Lord……”</p><p>“All you have to do is take all their lives.”</p><p>“But, if your lordship throws away this young lady…… then this young lady will again.”</p><p>“Do not behave like a spoiled child.”</p><p>Farnese flinched.</p><p>“I do not have the hobby of raising a broken doll.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Slowly.</p><p>A little bit at a time, Farnese’s trembling settled down.</p><p>I could not tell if 30 minutes or an hour had passed. Except, thanks  to the witches having cast a barrier around us, we did not freeze.  Farnese opened her mouth.</p><p>“Lord…… it is cold……”</p><p>“Have you gained your senses a bit?”</p><p>“This young lady is unsure……”</p><p>“Is the sound of cicadas still resonating in your ears?”</p><p>“A little…… but, it is much better than earlier.”</p><p>“Consider it a fortune that I had discovered you before Lapis did. If  it were Lapis, then she would have grabbed your head and buried it in  the snow.”</p><p>“Ah, aah. If it were Miss Lapis, then that is certainly possible—”</p><p>I pushed the back of Farnese’s head and instantly forced her face into the snow. Farnese did her utmost to wave her arms.</p><p>After 4, 5 seconds, I lifted Farnese’s head back up. With a ‘Puah’,  Farnese let out a breath. From her eyebrows to her nose, her entire face  was covered in snow. I smirked at her.</p><p>“And the thought that Lapis would question you further in a situation  like this seems to come to mind. I shall ask again. Have you recovered  your senses? Or do I have to shove more opium into your mouth for your  head to become clear?”</p><p>“……I see your highness’ personality is like that of a dog.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Oh? You have finally uttered a profanity. I give you my sincere  congratulations. I was quite curious on when you would finally learn how  to swear.”</p><p>Once I let go of her head, Farnese wiped her face with the edge of  her clothes. She picked up the hat that had fallen on the ground and  dusted it.</p><p>“……What kind of profanities must one say in order to let out their  feelings sufficiently in a situation like this? Your lordship is a man  who claims to know everything, so you should know this well.”</p><p>“Of course. If you mutter the word ‘fuck’, then everything will be a bliss.”</p><p>“That’s right. This feels like fuck.”</p><p>Farnese let out a sigh.</p><p>It was finally time to get into the main topic.</p><p>“For what reason did your lordship come all the way here to find this young lady?”</p><p>“The second army led by Marbas has been completely defeated.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Farnese gazed towards my direction.</p><p>A cold glow had returned to her eyes.</p><p>“……Then the margrave should be preparing for a running battle.”</p><p>“That is what I think as well. How to lure him out. In order to  discuss this topic, I have come here to bullshit with you during the  middle of the night.”</p><p>“Mm. The margrave is a veteran with a lot of caution. Even if we were  to feign a retreat, there is no possibility that he would simply chase  after us. A certain assurance, we have to plant a type of conviction  which will assure him that it would be okay to pursue our forces……”</p><p>Farnese spat on the ground. It seems she was getting rid of the snow  that was shoved into her face a second ago. I explained the rest of the  situation.</p><p>“Due to Marbas’ defeat, Barbatos has ended up being isolated. After  capturing the White Fortress within two days, our forces must travel  northwards without delay. Is this possible?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Farnese narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“It is not two days, lord. Tonight is the time limit.”</p><p>“Tonight?”</p><p>“Aah, there are two situations that the margrave fears the most. The  first is us hastily running away the moment we receive the urgent  message and being able to escape safe and sound. The second is the  margrave pursuing us while we withdraw leisurely, and meeting his defeat  by being caught in an ambush. These two are the worst turnouts for the  margrave. The former is allowing the enemy, that is running away right  before their eyes, to escape, so it would show disloyalty, and the  latter is being defeated by the enemy and falling down, so it would mean  the end of life.”</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>“The urgent message came today. It had arrived just now, lord. The  margrave most likely has yet to decide on whether he fears disloyalty or  death more. Once tonight passes and dawn arrives, the margrave’s  judgment will slowly become more clear. This confusing night, where the  margrave is still uncertain of his fears, this is the most optimum  opportunity for our forces. If we were to miss our chance today, then  luring out the margrave in the future will become nearly impossible.”</p><p>Farnese brushed the snow off of her and stood up.</p><p>Farnese gazed at the witches who were surrounding us in a circle. She muttered.</p><p>“Lord. Let us throw a bait.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The Northern Guardian, Margrave of Rosenberg, Georg von Rosenberg<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 3, Day 1</p><p> The Black Mountains, White Fortress</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>Late in the night.</p><p>A captain rushed to me and reported.</p><p>“General, we are being attacked! Witches are bombarding the walls!”</p><p>An enemy attack.</p><p>Due to that one phrase, I picked up my sheath and blade and immediately headed to the top of the rampart.</p><p>“What is happening?”</p><p>The soldiers were unable to give a proper response and pointed  towards the sky. As soon as I looked upwards, I saw witches soaring  through the night sky. The moonlight was being covered by clouds and  sleet, making it difficult to see their figures properly. Despite that, I  could tell that the number of witches was around 20. The witches  dropped stubby objects onto the rampart.</p><p>“This is……”</p><p>They were heads. The same type of heads that were catapulted last  time were now descending like hail by the hands of the witches. The  heads of humans, that were blackened by flames, covered the rampart.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Hii, hiiiiiik!</p><p>Ο</p><p>The soldiers lowered their backs and trembled. They believed that the  witches had placed a curse on the heads. Hearing the screams coming  from the privates, I narrowed my eyes.</p><p>“……”</p><p>Why?</p><p>After having pierced through the frigid winter air, why did they come  here this late into the night just to drop the heads of corpses?</p><p>Although it may be a rather efficient method in lowering the morale  on our side, the timing was peculiar. Of all occasions, it was during  this belated night. What meaning was there to this if they were not  going to initiate a siege?</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>While furrowing my brows, I gave an order.</p><p>“Send all the mages up.”</p><p>Our Aerial Mage Force stepped onto the rampart and flew up into the night sky.</p><p>The one thing aerial mages feared the most was fighting in the  darkness of the night. However, it was fine for this occasion. The  number of witches on their side was 20 and the mages on our side were  nearly 30. We can overwhelm them.</p><p>A heated battle filled the sky. Witches were shot down by crossbows  and screamed as they fell. The witches, who lost hold of their brooms,  fell to the ground and had their heads crushed from the impact.</p><p>The sound of heads cracking echoed from below the rampart. Like  pheasants would fall when killed by hunters, the witches descended one  by one. Since there was no light source in the bottom where the witches  fell, it appeared as dark as a pit to Hell. Corpses could not be seen  and only the sound of heads breaking resonated one after the other.  Despite being overwhelmed by military strength, the witches did not  flee.</p><p>At that moment, a realization like an electric current passed through my body.</p><p>“……!”</p><p>Was that it.</p><p>They were setting up preparations to allow the main force to pull out right away.</p><p>In order for the enemy troops to withdraw, for the sole reason to  gain more time to retreat, they had dispatched these witches. By  throwing the deceased heads, they threatened us. While we were mingling  with the witches and shrinking back from the threat, the enemy forces  were most likely retreating on the other side of the night horizon.</p><p>“General!”</p><p>A captain shouted.</p><p>Two witches were rushing towards me.</p><p>Surprised by their sudden drop, the crossbowmen desperately fired the  bolts that they had loaded previously. One of the witches’ heads was  pierced by a bolt and met her end. However, the other witch was still  alive and came towards me while pulling out a sword.</p><p>“Heub!”</p><p>Metal sharply collided against one another. I had raised my longsword and received the witch’s slash.</p><p>Although the witch’s physique was much smaller than me, so her  strength was not that impressive, that single blow, which also contained  the force accumulated from flying with her broom, was powerful.</p><p>Shifting the strength of the blow to my side, I rolled back. The  witch immediately flung herself at me. Since the witch stuck close to  me, while we exchanged blows with our blades, the soldiers around us  could not approach.</p><p>“Ahahah! Aha, ahah hahahaha—!”</p><p>The witch let out an insane laughter.</p><p>Her appearance looked as if she was barely over 10-years-old.</p><p>There was an arrow already impaled into the chest of this girl with  platinum blonde hair. Every time she swung her blade, blood flowed from  her wound. That should be painful enough to drive one mad, and yet, the  witch simply laughed. In order to not give the witch the opportunity to  intonate a spell, I cornered her with my sword. And then, at the moment a  gap was made, I struck the witch’s stomach with my left fist.</p><p>“—Pa, ha.”</p><p>Unable to withstand my strike, the witch was blown away.</p><p>The witch’s body went over the rampart and fell to the bottom of the wall.</p><p>The crossbowmen stuck to the edge of the rampart and started to fire  downwards. The air was silent in the areas where the bolts passed  through. The witch did not rise up once more. Since the sound of a head  cracking was not heard, I conjectured that she was able to avoid death.</p><p>“General, are you alright!?”</p><p>“Can you not tell by looking at me? I have not aged to the point where I would get done in by a young girl.”</p><p>I sheathed my sword.</p><p>In the distant night sky, the witches that had survived were fleeing.  It seemed six or seven of the 20 witches had died. Seeing that the  escaping shadows were small in number, it was pitiable.</p><p>“All forces, open the fortress gates and sortie! The enemy troops are  planning to escape while using the witches as a scapegoat in order to  distract us. Blow the horns!”</p><p>After repelling the witches, the soldiers cried out. The mages shot fireballs into the night sky to celebrate our victory.</p><p>In this cloudy night, the explosion of the fireballs could be seen  vividly. Influenced by that vivid light, our soldiers forgot about the  cold, forgot about death, and went through the gates. The company  commanders and adjutants ran around the dim grounds to organize the  ranks. I mounted a white horse and went to the front.</p><p>There was no doubt.</p><p>After hearing that their main attack force was defeated, the Demon Lord was planning to evacuate back to the demon territory.</p><p>Since he had no confidence in facing us and also had no determination  to hold out, by blaming it on the defeat of the other unit, he most  likely intended to draw back entirely.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Follow me!”</p><p>There was no time to lose.</p><p>If Dantalian is able to retreat safely, then that would not be my victory. The triumph will go solely to the Imperial Princess.</p><p>Because the Imperial Princess had won, the enemy troops had  retreated. If I were to spectate here then I would descend into being a  mere fool who had lost the Black Fortress and was only able to take it  back thanks to the Imperial Princess. If that were to happen, then this  war would be completely decorated as the Imperial Princess’ victory.  That must not happen!</p><p>Someone must block the Imperial Princess’ lead. If it is not  obstructed, then no one could know when that lead would turn into a  flood. When the Imperial Princess dethrones her own father for the name  of glory, and when she purges her own brother with the justification of  victory, in these situations, who could possibly condemn her? If no one  is able to do this, then there is no other choice but for me to step  forward.</p><p>Since that is the duty of a noble.</p><p>Since that is my mission as a Rosenberg.</p><p>For the peace of the Empire, and for my vengeance, Demon Lord Dantalian, you shall fall in these Black Mountains tonight.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 3, Day 1</p><p> The Black Mountains, mountain pass</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>20 witches had gone out and 12 had returned. All 12 witches had their chests penetrated and were bleeding.</p><p>I could not see Humbaba among them.</p><p>“……”</p><p>Feeling wretched, I could not ask where Humbaba was. I could only ask  if they could continue fighting. If the witches were to say that it  would be difficult, then I planned to exclude them from the battle.</p><p>“Can you fly again?”</p><p>“We shall repay our master’s kindness with our lives.”</p><p>The witches knelt down in the snow with their bloody bodies. In the  places where their blood dripped, holes were made in the snow. Glancing  down at those red holes, I vowed. At any cost, I shall obtain victory in  this battle.</p><p>Although our forces were in the possession of 50 witches, I had  purposely sent only 20 in order to lure out the enemy. The 20 witches  had accepted that irrational command without a word. And without a word,  9 of them had fallen to their demise. What the 9 had thought as they  felt the cold winter air for the final time, and how solitary they must  have felt as they descended to the boundlessly dark abyss by their  lonesome, I could not dare measure that emotion. They had died for me.</p><p>I quietly commanded the captains.</p><p>“Rely on the wooden fences. The enemy will situate their cavalry at  the front and charge at our forces. It will be over if you yield from  those fences. The spearmen shall protect the crossbowmen, and the  crossbowmen shall depend on the spearmen. Rely on one another and hold  out together.”</p><p>The captains repeated the orders and ran out to the front lines.</p><p>From a distance, the sound of hooves reverberated and shook the  earth. As the hooves raised clouds of snow from the ground, the enemy  cavalry drew near. In this dark night, their figures could not be seen  in detail but instead appeared as one huge mass, like a single giant  shadow. Between the shadows, the sharp sound of horns was mixed. Hooves,  snow dust, and horns were chaotically fused together, making it appear  as if it was not a thousand, but ten thousand that were approaching us.</p><p>“Blow the horns.”</p><p>Our buglers blew their breaths into their horns. In the night sky,  the respiration of the enemy soldiers and the breaths of our forces  intermingled, and the witches flew up into that sky once more.</p><p>In the sky resonating the sound of horns, the witches and mages  crossed paths. And on the ground trembling by the hooves, infantry and  cavalry clashed. Blood that burst forth from the sky scattered downwards  and the blood surging from the ground shot upwards. The world was  soaked in blood.</p><p>A captain’s adjutant shouted.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Your highness, it’s the enemy infantry!</p><p>Ο</p><p>The moonlight faintly displayed the enemy soldiers on the other side  of the mountain pass. Although their faces could not be seen, the spears  which they were holding shined brightly in the dim light. My center  army consisted of 2,500 soldiers, but it appeared that the enemy  soldiers reached around 5,000 if they added the cavalry together with  the infantry.</p><p>Though the wooden fences, which our troops were relying on, were  sturdy, the amount we had was low. There were large gaps placed between  each fence. The enemy cavalry continuously pressed their horses towards  those spots. Our spearmen were slowly being pushed back. A spear thrust  out by an enemy cavalry pierced the head of one of our infantrymen. The  spearhead went through their eye and came out from the back of their  head.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>After mounting a horse and staring out onto the battlefield, I spoke calmly.</p><p>“Endure. We will survive if you endure. If you yield, then we will all perish.”</p><p>I felt bitter about my helplessness. In this grim night, the soldiers  were all respectively alone. On their own, our soldiers managed the  shadows of the enemy which approached them like a flood. As battles were  carried out by the soldiers and not myself, I could not die in their  steads, and that task of dying was solely taken by the soldiers.</p><p>Our troops fell head first into the snow and died. As long as they  were not allies, the enemy forces stepped on the corpses and buried them  further into the snow. The hair of the half-buried corpses shook due to  the wind. Since their corpses were firm, no type of flowery words could  remain. Death was something that denied words.</p><p>I gazed at the pine forest to the left of the battlefield. Farnese  was most likely hiding there while holding her breath. It felt like I  could feel her breathing as she stared like a wolf at the battlefield  with her green eyes.</p><p>Whether I fell first, whether the enemy soldiers could break through  our defenses first, or whether Farnese enveloping the enemy soldiers  from behind would come first, I could not grasp how the sequence was  going to end up. Everyone was alone in this night battle. I repeated the  same words I had said a moment ago.</p><p>“Endure. We will survive if you endure.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The Northern Guardian, Margrave of Rosenberg, Georg von Rosenberg<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 3, Day 1</p><p> The Black Mountains, mountain pass</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>“Attack! Do not rest and continue to rage!”</p><p>Our infantry rushed forward one after the other. There was no time  for rest. Until the night was over, there was going to be no breaks.  Before we have destroyed the wooden pickets, massacred the enemy  soldiers, and have achieved victory by taking the head of the Demon  Lord, there will be no pause until then. Kill them, tear them, and rip  them to pieces…… Commands that were not words, but were instead, nothing  more than an explosion of sounds, came pouring out.</p><p>A blind arrow flew towards me and grazed my shoulder. Blood flowed  and my body felt warm. The captains were unaware of my injury. Good. It  was better off like this. It was much better that they did not know of  my scratch. Is this not what night battles were? I shouted out the  burning energy that was boiling inside me.</p><p>“Crush them!”</p><p>Words disappeared from the battlefield and only noise echoed  throughout. Spear! Spear……! A knight who had dropped his weapon  mid-charge started to call out. He grabbed a spear, unaware of who had  given it to him, and resumed his assault. They were covered in the  blizzard raised by the hooves of the horses, so the knights were not  clearly visible. Once again, someone shouted, Spear……! Spear……! and was  consumed by the snow. I could see something vividly on the backs of the  mounted troops who were charging in to be consumed by the blizzard.  Although I was unsure of what it was, I was certain that it was  something that surpassed words. That was, perhaps, a part which was in  the blind spot of life. The blindness of life.</p><p>The captains spoke.</p><p>“There are fewer enemy soldiers than predicted, general.”</p><p>“And we can’t see the enemy’s cavalry as well.”</p><p>I nodded my head.</p><p>“It appears to be less than 3,000. The Demon Lord must have run away  with his Royal Guards beforehand. Those men are resisting in order to  give the Demon Lord time to escape.”</p><p>My prediction was on the mark.</p><p>Dantalian responded quickly to the news of Marbas’ defeat. While  sending out the witches to employ a smokescreen tactic, Dantalian  retreated with his main force. If I had waited until dawn, then the  Demon Lord’s main force would have gotten all the way back to the Black  Fortress without receiving any harm.</p><p>Oh, how unfortunate, Dantalian.</p><p>Your anxiety has ruined you. Rather, if it were not for you having  sent out your witches, then I would have most likely waited until dawn.  This was most likely what it meant for the biter to be bitten.</p><p>Even if Dantalian were able to get away with his guards, it was fine. Although it was regretful that we were going to be unable to fulfill the quota for Demon Lords, just annihilating this main force of his would be quite the large exploit.</p><p>My biggest goal was to prevent the Imperial Princess from holding a  monopoly on the laurels of victory. I was satisfied with achieving this.</p><p>“We have breached the wooden fences!”</p><p>“General, our infantry have broken through!”</p><p>The captains got excited.</p><p>Primarily, our forces overwhelmed the enemy with numbers. Like how a  person would latch onto a log if they had fallen into a river, the enemy  soldiers were relying on that feeble fence and holding out.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Since the enemy troops were in the middle of withdrawing, they were  unable to properly set up their fences, and now, the already few amount  of pickets they were able to put up had collapsed. What could the enemy  rely on now? Be swept up in the flood of our soldiers and drown!</p><p>“Please give us the order to carry out an all-out attack, general!”</p><p>“Allow us to take part in the glory of a great victory!”</p><p>“Mm. Go.”</p><p>I nodded my head in approval.</p><p>Letting out a roar, the captains waved their flags. Finally, our  reserve troops advanced to the front line as well. The sound of horns  resonated.</p><p>Each company’s horn had a different tone, but the battlefield was too  disorderly to distinguish the tones. This chaos will soon end once the  battle was over.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— ……</p><p>Ο</p><p>Between the noise, a certain pitch came into my ear. Indeed, it was the sound of horns.</p><p>However, it felt like that sound was further and higher up than the others.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Buuu……</p><p>Ο</p><p>I was at least certain that the sound was not coming from our troops.  Was the sound coming from the demons? If that was so, then the noise  should have been coming from up ahead, and yet, I was hearing the sound  from the forest on the other side. Following the noise, I gazed at the  pine tree grove.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Buuuuu, buuu……</p><p>Ο</p><p>The sound drew closer. It was approaching faster than the speed of an  average person’s gait. The horn was not being blown by infantry but by  cavalry. The moonlight slipped between the gaps in the clouds. In the  forest that was being faintly lit, the branches on the pine trees shook.  The pine trees shuddered and brushed off the snow.</p><p>Receiving the snow falling from the branches, a girl emerged from the pine grove.</p><p>The girl was riding on a black horse. She lightly shook off the snow  that had fallen onto her head. Following the movement of the girl, the  black horse snorted. A blizzard was raging, but the flurry aimed away  from the girl, making her the sole clear person in the center of the  violent winter wind.</p><p><img data-attachment-id=\"31909\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2016/09/23/dungeon-defense-volume-3-chapter-3-part-2/%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-3-page-278/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-278.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"819,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-3-page-278\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-278.jpg?w=205\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-278.jpg?w=700\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-278.jpg?w=700\" alt=\"%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-3-page-278\"></p><p>“……”</p><p>The girl glanced towards this direction. It felt as if she had met my  gaze, however, I did not feel her gaze with my eyes, but with my entire  body instead. Her eyes were emotionless and indifferent like the  winter. She simply held her position like the wind. The girl opened her  mouth.</p><p>The words which she had uttered were most likely these.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Slaughter them.</p><p>Ο</p><p>That was it.</p><p>The moment her words flowed into the air.</p><p>The sound of horns raged.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Buuuuuuuu.</p><p>Ο</p><p>A countless number of demon cavalry emerged from the pine grove.  Centaurs born with the faces of humans and the legs of horses let out a  battle cry. The demon cavalry leaped over our rear, the wooden fences,  and advanced further to lash the back of our troops.</p><p>Because they were suddenly caught from behind, our military personnel  were thrown into confusion. Although they hastily attempted to set up a  defense, there was no space. The wooden fences were interfering. Due to  the immense shock, I could only watch the sight of my soldiers running  about in confusion and drift further apart.</p><p>The captains whom I could command, and the captains who would listen  to my orders and pass them on, were not at my side. Above all else,  everything was already too late. Even if I were to run into that chaotic  battlefield, even if I put my life on the line, I could never turn the  progress of this battle now. The intuition which had been with me  throughout my entire life declared.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>That this was my defeat.</p><p>Aah.</p><p>Aaah—.</p><p>Our soldiers kept being pushed into a corner. Trying to hide behind  the wooden pickets, the soldiers conflicted against one another. The  wooden fences were unable to handle the struggle and had collapsed. The  men tumbled onto the ground and sprayed out snow as they hit the earth.  The soldiers flailed while on top of the snow.</p><p>The girl was still standing tall at the edge of the forest and  looking down at the battle. The breath flowing from her lips rose  upwards. She did not move. It felt as if the battleground was completely  irrelevant to the girl.</p><p>Oh, Gods.</p><p>How could you have, to a Devil?</p><p>How could you have allowed a Devil to triumph?</p><p>Is it to fulfill your justice here on our land? Is the defeat of this  old man proper in your righteousness? Is it your grand design to allow  that Demon Lord, who had slaughtered, burned, and ridiculed innocent  prisoners, to achieve victory?</p><p>“……”</p><p>I stared up at the sky.</p><p>The witches and mages were fighting intensely in the night sky.  However, the intensity that the witches were once receiving had turned  around at some point, and now the mages were enduring the ferocity. The  witches, whose numbers were once lower than 20, now appeared as if there  were over 30. Our mages fell. They fell with their heads cut and their  arms severed. They had become a red winter flower and were plucked petal  by petal.</p><p>Ο</p><p>So I was deceived.</p><p>I was deceived so I have lost.</p><p>And since I have lost, I should die.</p><p>Ο</p><p>“……”</p><p>I put on my helmet.</p><p>Frozen by the winter wind, the helmet was cold. The frigid sensation  from the iron burrowed deep into my head and into my thoughts. While  forgetting about the Gods and dismissing justice from my mind, I simply  glared at the path to rush ahead.</p><p>The young lad grabbed my reigns.</p><p>“Your honor, where are you planning to go……?”</p><p>“I am afraid of the humiliation I will receive for returning alive. You can leave. Ride my reserve horse and go far away.”</p><p>The lad did not leave. He got on the reserve horse and pulled out a sword. I could not stop him.</p><p>After we turned the heads of our horses and rushed into the enemy  forces, the lad was the first to fall due to being shot by arrows. He  had endured 3 bolts. Subsequent to an arrow piercing his throat, the lad  rolled off from his saddle. I had yet to fall so I continued my  advance.</p><p>At that moment, someone shouted towards me.</p><p>“Why, is it not the margrave!”</p><p>“……!”</p><p>My eyes were dragged by the voice that I could not dare forget.</p><p>Over a wall of men and horses, Demon Lord Dantalian was mounted on a horse.</p><p>The Demon Lord widely grinned.</p><p>“Where are you going in such a rush, margrave! Is the night sky not  beautiful and the snow marvelous? Is the blood of the soldiers sprayed  across everything not splendid as well? If you are in such a hurry, then  you may miss all of these sceneries. Go with more leisure!”</p><p>“……You, bastard.”</p><p>“Ah, the margrave may be a bit too old to enjoy the scenery. You may  have shat and pissed yourself because of all the surprising events that  have happened tonight. But do not worry. I am courteous to the elderly,  after all. I shall receive all of your shit and piss.”</p><p>Dantalian burst out laughing towards the sky.</p><p>“Please do not decline. Do we not have a special tie between us, margrave?”</p><p>“You scoundrel—!”</p><p>I charged towards the location the Demon Lord was at with my horse.</p><p>The centaurs quickly came at me in order to protect the Demon Lord.</p><p>As I desperately slashed and beheaded centaurs, something powerful  collided against the back of my head. My head throbbed and I lost my  balance.</p><p>My face became enveloped by the cold snow. While feeling my face  become cold and the back of my head become hot, I closed my eyes.</p><p>The sound of the Imperial Princess’ empty laugh brushed past my ear.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Sir Rosenberg, Sir Rosenberg. Oh, Sir Rosenberg……</p><p>Ο</p><p>And then I lost consciousness.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The Northern Guardian, Margrave of Rosenberg, Georg von Rosenberg<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 3, Day 1</p><p> The Black Mountains, mountain pass</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>—The moment I opened my eyes, the sight of a man and multiple girls  sitting down and leaning against one another came into my vision. The  man was wearing black clothes. He was slowly stroking a girl with  platinum blonde hair who was using his lap as a pillow.</p><p>I was unsure of what she was so ecstatic about, but the girl kept  rubbing her cheek against the man’s lap. There was a bandage wrapped  around the girl’s head.</p><p>On the man’s other side, there was another girl seated beside him. The sound of pages from a book being flipped could be heard.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I closed my eyes once and opened them again. Was this reality? Was  this a hallucination? The world surrounding them was pure white as it  was covered in snow. The sunlight was reflected irregularly so the  border between reality and hallucination became faint.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— ……?</p><p>— ……</p><p>Ο</p><p>They whispered in words that I could not understand. The platinum  blonde haired girl kept laughing, the man laughed occasionally, and the  blonde girl did not laugh at all. In that location, they were all melted  together as one.</p><p>From a distance, a pink haired girl approached while holding a  platter. The man and the girls received a plate of food from the  platter. At that moment, the pink haired girl pointed towards my  direction and muttered something. The man looked at me.</p><p><em>Splash</em></p><p>Lukewarm water drenched my head. I coughed and raised my body. Blood was mixed into my coughs.</p><p>After spitting out some blood, my head became clear and my vision  distinct. The man and the girls were not sitting in the center of  sunlight. There was an endless number of corpses spread out around them.</p><p>“Margrave, I see you are alive.”</p><p>The man spoke.</p><p>“Consider it a fortune that your life line is long. If Humbaba here had died, then you would have died by my hands as well.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>I spat out the blood in my mouth and spoke.</p><p>“Why did you spare me?”</p><p>“I did not spare you. You survived absolutely on your own. Although  we had used ropes to bind you, who had fallen on the battlefield, that  was it. We did not cure or take care of you.”</p><p>You survived on your own.</p><p>My heart felt numbed by the Demon Lord’s words. What was I trying to  accomplish by surviving? Exactly what hidden part of my mind struggled  desperately to stay alive?</p><p>“……What do you plan to do with me?”</p><p>“I am your enemy, and you are also my enemy. Since there are no relations as tied together as ours, I give you my sympathy.”</p><p>The Demon Lord chuckled.</p><p>“Respecting one’s elders is an etiquette that surpasses both race and nationality. I shall release you.”</p><p>I was stifled.</p><p>The girls lined up beside the man were gazing this way with stoic faces.</p><p>It felt as if their expressionless faces were the naked face of death.</p><p>“……Kill me. Take my life instead.”</p><p>“Take a strong hold of your mind, margrave. Since you have survived  on your own, should you not die on your own as well? Ah, it would be  unwieldy to drag around an old man on my own. I shall place one of your  horse attendants as your servant. Do not be so disappointed.”</p><p>“The soldiers…… what happened to my officers and men?”</p><p>“They all died.”</p><p>“Nonetheless, are there not fellows who had survived?”</p><p>Dantalian smiled.</p><p>“We killed them all.”</p><p>Aah.</p><p>I vomited out blood. My internal organs surged in reverse. After  heaving out something soft and wet, I lost consciousness once more.</p><p>Oh Gods.</p><p>Oh Gods.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 3, Day 1</p><p> The Black Mountains, mountain pass</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>While glancing at the margrave being taken away on a stretcher, Lapis spoke.</p><p>“Your highness. Is there a reason why you are sparing that one’s  life? Rosenberg is a prestigious family among prestigious families, that  has fought against the Demon Lord armies for generations. If your  highness takes that man’s neck then that grandeur will shake the entire  world.”</p><p>“That is why I must not take his neck.”</p><p>I softly brushed the hair of Humbaba who was lying on my lap. Humbaba  mewled while imitating the sound of a cat. A scout had discovered  Humbaba, who had fallen in the snow near the White Fortress, and brought  her back. Fortunately, her wounds were not severe. I asked if Humbaba  had something she wished for. She answered immediately.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— A lap pillow!</p><p>Ο</p><p>I more than gladly accepted this modest request. Lapis as well did  not say anything in criticism for this occasion. We all acknowledged the  contributions made by the witches. One day, I shall console the witches  with a true reward that is not something like a mere lap pillow. While  smiling, I spoke.</p><p>“Marbas was defeated and even Barbatos has been pushed into a corner.  How could I triumph so grandly on my own while the progress of the  war is this tragic? I will stick out. A person who sticks out will be  struck. Although we are sending Rosenberg back alive……”</p><p>Rosenberg will be driven to death by the Imperial Princess anyway.</p><p>I swallowed those words down. That was a line that I had no reason to  go out of my way to say. I placed words that were less suspicious on my  mouth.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“The territory which Rosenberg rules over shall soon be land occupied  by us, anyway. If we were to take the life of the lord respected by his  subjects, then we will only raise their anger. For the future when we  rule over them, I must be tolerant.”</p><p>I wonder if she had accepted that answer. Lapis did not question further. I spoke.</p><p>“Inform Barbatos of our victory. Furthermore, include a calumny  requesting that she should clean those lips of hers since I will be  going to assist her.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Lapis narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“Your highness, you always emphasize that you despise women with  small chests, but in truth, is that not a lie? It seems as if quite the  amount of your highness’ mind resides in Barbatos. This one is holding  doubts.”</p><p>How noisy.</p><p>Farnese leaned against me and silently read her book, and Humbaba  purred with her head placed on my lap. I reckoned I should indulge in  the antics of these two for today.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The Northern Guardian, Margrave of Rosenberg, Georg von Rosenberg<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 3, Day 1</p><p> The Black Mountains vicinity</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>“……”</p><p>Once I opened my eyes again, I found myself lying on a bed.</p><p>According to the horse attendant, who had followed me as a valet, he  claimed that the witches had taken and dropped us off at a nearby  village. This was the village chief’s room, and after sleeping for half a  day, I was barely able to regain my senses. When I asked him about what  had happened to the rest of my men, the soldier lowered his head. I  could not ask anything.</p><p>Supported by the attendant, I left the village chief’s house.</p><p>The village was at the foot of the mountains. Strangely, the town was  quiet. At dawn, due to the sound of gunpowder exploding at the White  Fortress, the village people had evacuated. Since the place of  evacuation was incommodious to the old village chief, he said that he  had stayed at home. It seemed the chief had realized that I was a lord.</p><p>Once we neared the entrance of the village, the Black Mountains could  be seen clearly. The White Fortress was enveloped in an inferno. The  flames from the fortress stuck fast to the foot of the mountain, and  from the foot, a path of flames stretched upwards to the peak, making  the Black Mountains become a burnt pitch black.</p><p>Putting these flames behind them, an army of thousands was leaving  towards somewhere. They were truly leaving. Although I could not tell  where they were going towards, it was certain that it was not to the  demon territory but towards the humans’.</p><p>I sunk into the snow-covered ground and cried out for a long time. My knees trembled and my vocal cords became torn.</p><p>Ο</p><p>……Ah, is this life? Are you telling me that this is also life?</p><p>Ο</p><p>I am a human. However, I am a traitor who had made the humans fall. I  was a traitor who was a thousand times more heinous than a turncoat who  had sold out their own country. The land was now going to be trampled  by the foreign enemies. Moreover, it was a land where countless more  humans will be born and raised in. Because of this old man, the young  ones, who were going to be born and raised from now on, were going to be  trampled before they could bloom. What am I to do about this? What can I  do……?</p><p>I was barely able to stand once night had arrived. Tearing the lower end of my clothes, I used that torn piece of clothing as  parchment and borrowed a writing utensil from the village chief. I  handed the report to the soldier and sent him away first. I told him to  go first and inform the Imperial Princess of our defeat. The lines that I  had written while enduring the trembling in my fingers were this.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— 3rd month, 1st day. Enemy forces have captured the White Fortress.  Military strength approximately 4,000. Demon Lord Dantalian is the  commander. Our forces were annihilated.</p><p>Ο</p><p>When I wrote the line that our troops were annihilated, my body shook.</p><p>I cursed my destiny that had allowed me to age until I was an old  man. However, because I did not say the things I should have said, I was  cornered this far, and since writing the things that I must write was  the last task bestowed upon me, I wrote the rest.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— 3rd month, 1st day. Enemy forces have captured the White Fortress.  Military strength approximately 4,000. Demon Lord Dantalian is the  commander. Our forces were annihilated.

It’s similar to how Lapis would  always refers to herself as ‘this one’ when talking to people of  authority. He used a word similar to ‘main body/center/duce’ instead of  using the word ‘I’, and would always do it in his monologue too. If need  be, I’ll go back on a later date to change all that, but for now, the  reason why I’m telling you guys this is because of the final part of  this chapter.</p><p> When he monologue’d this line, “I was barely able to stand once night  had arrived.”, he actually corrects himself from calling himself ‘main  body’, and simply refers to himself as ‘I’.

So yeah. Cheers for a faster than usual release.</p>"

We pillaged the supplies that were piled up like a mountain within the White Fortress, and since it would be beyond our capacity to pillage everything, we burned the rest. While we were burning the supplies, which we originally planned to use to feed and clothe the&nbsp;prisoners, we also decided to burn the captives as well.</p><p>Since that would be more efficient.</p><p>I ordered for cruelty.</p><p>“Set ablaze every single human village we see on our path.”</p><p>Flames and smoke were present wherever my army went. My soldiers marched as they set ablaze everything&nbsp;that lay in our path,&nbsp;and marched while placing the smoke behind them. We advanced strenuously in order to provide aid for&nbsp;Barbatos.</p><p>The humans desired to push the assault back to the demon territory. Since war was an occurrence that trampled over the land which&nbsp;they&nbsp;took place in, the humans wished for&nbsp;the land of the demons to be trampled instead of their own.</p><p>Now, during the current situation where the second army had completely fallen, the only person blocking the path of the massive human army was Demon Lord Barbatos. Barbatos was barely obstructing the human army of 40,000 with her own 20,000 soldiers. Providing aid for Barbatos was a major task. That way, the demon territory&nbsp;could avoid the terrible disaster of war. Barbatos and I will not become the renegades&nbsp;who had brought upon this war.</p><p>“Do not become obsessed with pillaging! Kill them if you wish to take their lives, but do not waste your energy in&nbsp;slaughter. We do not have the time to rape so manage your lower bodies fairly. Burn all the human towns&nbsp;and turn those villagers into the homeless.”</p><p>I did not have even a touch of hesitation. Burn everything. Set ablaze everything in sight. The villages and supplies which we do not burn will become the lifeline that will feed the enemy.&nbsp;I was executing a cheongya tactic in reverse.</p><p><em>(TL note: Cheongya tactic (청야 전술)&nbsp;– A tactic where the defending army would retreat while burning every supply that could possibly be used by&nbsp;the enemy forces.)</em></p><p>Occasionally, the elders of the villages would be driven mad by the pent-up frustration and beg to us. The elders pleaded that they at least needed the seeds if they wished to carry out the first tilling during the upcoming spring, so they begged for us to not tear out their hopes to survive&nbsp;by&nbsp;the roots. I did not have the time to explain to the elders the urgency of our situation. Their circumstances should not be mine and my circumstances should&nbsp;not be theirs, so I did not have the time to make our misaligned circumstances interlock. Even if I did&nbsp;have enough time, that was a difficult dislocation to fix. I browbeat the elders.</p><p>“Then will you die? Would you rather die instead? Listen to me carefully, humans. Until the winter is over, run away to the mountains and do not come down. The farming this year has come to an end, so do not hold any lingering attachment. Do not return from the mountain valleys!”</p><p>With tears in their eyes, the old men and women&nbsp;departed to find&nbsp;refuge.</p><p>The smoke rising from the Black Mountains was moving ever so slightly, but&nbsp;with certainty, towards the north. As each day passed, the villages that laid on our&nbsp;northward path were&nbsp;turned into flames.</p><p>People overflowed from the towns where only ashes remained. The humans who had lost their homes escaped towards the south or hid in the mountains. The smoke was dense on all sides. The sound of crying&nbsp;and weeping echoed throughout the areas where the fumes were thick. They should consider it a fortune that the snow and rain that fell during our march of arson was light. If it had become difficult to set things ablaze because of the weather, then I would have killed every single human.</p><p>The refugees sang as they departed.</p><p>Ο</p><p><em>If we go now, when will we return</em></p><p><em>If we go now, when will we return</em></p><p><em>Our villages are burning and our sons are burning</em></p><p><em>Aha, if we go now, then when will we return……</em></p><p>Ο</p><p>When they had no path to tread and no destination to arrive at, it seemed humans relied on songs on their road of departure . Although the song was sorrowful and foolish, I did not stop them. If anything, I shoved the backs of the humans. Run away, spread it, spread the song&nbsp;wide, inform the people with a song that we have arrived as your plague……</p><p>En route, the army of the dukes&nbsp;blocked our path. They were soldiers who had ran away from their strongholds because they were unable to endure the bitter song of the people. However, this was after the dukes had offered the majority of their military personnel to the Imperial family in order to provide military assistance. Although their spirit was praiseworthy, solely their spirit was what could be complimented. While slightly glancing at the enemy forces that barely reached 50 soldiers, Farnese asked.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“What should we do, lord?”</p><p>“Trample over them.”</p><p>“Understood.&nbsp;……How tiresome.”</p><p>While muttering about how bothersome it was, Farnese commanded our troops.</p><p>Since our victory was much too apparent, Farnese devised a game. It was a play to see how she could kill all 50 enemy soldiers without missing a single one. While testing all kinds of tactics, Farnese taunted the enemy. The game was a success. The soldiers were&nbsp;wiped out completely.</p><p>We severed the heads of the so-called soldiers and dangled them on poles. Every time we burned a village down, we threw in about 15 heads. After seeing those heads, the elderly folks listened to our words a slight bit better. Without having the need for us to verbally threaten them, they packed their stuff on their own discretion in order to find refuge. It was straight forward. I should have done this sooner.</p><p>We were without a doubt a Demon Lord’s army.</p><p>If one were to express it a bit more accurately, then we were an army of bastards.</p><p>Our military personnel considered the fact that they were bastards as something to be proud of. As we pillaged more, our soldiers formed a stronger army. Marching was not painful.</p><p>Our own soldiers would give our army titles, such as ‘The Harbingers of Winter’, ‘The Human’s Plague’, and ‘The Pillagers of Mountains’. Since the winter was something that was damned, the plague was something to be sworn at, and pillaging was a vile thing to do, one could know how dastardly my army was. How cheer-worthy. Aha, how anarchistic. It was a good season.</p><p>My life was more than just miserable, so I would sing about my forlornness. The refugees sang because they did not know where to go, and I sang because I did not know where I had come from. The song of a person who had nowhere to go&nbsp;and the song of a person who had nowhere to return&nbsp;were completely different.</p><p>“What shall it be: this or that–? The walls behind the temple of the city’s deity&nbsp;have fallen – shall it be this–? When they die and die again a hundred times–. Or if we die and die together nonetheless – shall it be that–?”</p><p><em>(TL note: This is a fusion of two poems Hayeoga(하여가) and Dansimga(단심가). Hayeoga was created in order to declare the death of an era.&nbsp;)</em></p><p>Ο</p><p>Our officers and men chanted, slaughtered, pillaged, and committed arson. With a ‘koong chuck’, an excited air blew as they swung their blades, and with another ‘koong chuck’, they hummed as they put down the flames. Every time the chant was sung, blood was splattered.</p><p>As we advanced further north, the four-beat drum tune became convivial. The witches were the ones most giddy about the trot and let out a whimsical vibe. While riding on their brooms, the witches flew low and sang the chorus. Below the witches, the soldiers sang along while treading the ground. As the chorus and repetition were going back and forth, our march proceeded quickly.</p><p>The song of refugees spread to the south. The song of invaders dug its way into the north. The anthem of refugees was the weeping of the people, and the anthem of pillagers was the gaiety of the people, so I did not differentiate the two. I simply considered them all as the people. While being enshrouded by the smoke rising from the flames, we spread the melody.</p><p>While all of our troops were going along with the rhythm, solely Lapis remained cold. Lapis firmly refused to sing.</p><p>“That is a bad habit.”</p><p>It was honestly an accurate&nbsp;discernment.</p><p>Ο</p><p>3rd month, 11th day.</p><p>Before the 13th day that Barbatos had made us vow.</p><p>We had grabbed the enemy’s blockade by the nape.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st,&nbsp;Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 3, Day&nbsp;11</p><p>Naris Plains</p><p>Ο</p><p>“—Break through them.”</p><p>I spoke while pointing towards the enemy encirclement.</p><p>To the people, words followed the world and were changed according to their lives. However, for the individuals in power, the world followed words, and&nbsp;the lives of others changed according to the words spoken by the figures of authority. I was a man of influence. I ordered them to break through, thus it happened.</p><p>Humbaba led the other witches and carpet-bombed the enemy. We had plundered so much gunpowder from the White Fortress that we were now nearly overflowing with it. The witches scattered the pouches of gunpowder without reserve. Soon after, the mages on the enemy forces’ side flew up into the air to retaliate.</p><p>The enemy troops were many and our forces were few. Regardless, the enemy soldiers were spread out vastly in order to form an encirclement. Our forces retracted and stabbed into a single point. The enemy was dispersed and we were focused. The enemy forces had to keep an eye out for both the outside and inside of their encirclement, while all we had to do was rush forward while only looking ahead. As if hammering a nail into a plank of wood, Farnese hammered our soldiers into the blockade. Excluding this, there was no other plot or unusual wit. It was a powerful frontal attack.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Farnese uttered.</p><p>“An army that wins through a frontal assault is a happy army.”</p><p>Her words became few when she was commanding. She would only embed the tactics into the other captains during the strategy meetings, but during actual combat, she watched the battlefield with a flickering gaze.</p><p>Farnese would read battlefields as if she was looking at a book. It felt as if the soldiers’ shouts, the movement of the unit, and the sound of horns all had a fixed meaning to her, and that meaning alluded to words and lines. When our soldiers’ movements were vague, she spoke.</p><p>“Do not falter and go forth.”</p><p>When the enemy forces endured tenaciously, she spoke.</p><p>“Hold out as well, and be resolute to shed your blood.”</p><p>Once the enemy encirclement started to fall apart, she spoke again.</p><p>“Attack there.”</p><p>Farnese read the battlefield as if it were a book, and as if she were correcting all the misprints within a paperback, she amended the errors on a battlefield with her orders. Her commands were precise, and therefore engraved deeply into our officers and men.</p><p>Without uttering a word, the captains held Laura De Farnese, who was gazing down at the back of their heads, with high esteem. They boasted that they were able to feel the acting general’s gaze while they were fighting. From the captains to the privates, there was not a single person who doubted the general’s words. I recalled the words of a genius mathematician who claimed that the entire world appeared as numbers to him. To Farnese, the battlefield most likely appeared as words and sentences to her. A natural talent.</p><p>Before the 2-hour mark had passed since we had begun our assault on the blockade, Farnese nodded.</p><p>“It is over.”</p><p>A&nbsp;crooked smile drifted over Farnese’s lips.</p><p>Ο</p><p>♦</p><p>Ο</p><p>5 minutes later, as she had stated, the encirclement collapsed. The enemy forces raised their flags and fled. Since their retreat appeared to be deliberate, Farnese forbade our troops from pursuing them thoughtlessly.</p><p>“Do not go after them. We will end up suffering instead.”</p><p>The captains kept silent and obeyed the order. It was a captain’s joy to chase after remnant enemy troops, hit them from behind, and empty their pockets. Bewitched by that interest, the number of soldiers who preferred plundering over fighting was countless. However, Farnese was not a general who was stingy about looting. The captains, who had pillaged as much as they wanted to during our forced march here, understood the general’s nature well. If Farnese told them to not pursue, then they must not pursue. It was a solemn rule.</p><p>After the enemy soldiers had withdrawn, as if curtains were being pulled aside, Barbatos’ encampment was revealed. The person in charge of the campsite came out.</p><p>“Welcome, Dantalian. Thanks to you, we are able to survive another day.”</p><p>“I can only apologize for my belated arrival.”</p><p>“To say that you are late…… We did not have any expectation that someone would arrive in the first place.”</p><p>The supervisor smiled bitterly. There was blood smeared on the supervisor’s pure white beard. This man with the appearance of an old man was a&nbsp;Demon Lord, rank 16th Zepar.</p><p>“Although it would only be proper etiquette to treat you and your men to a banquet for having allowed us to escape death, disconcertingly, our current situation is unfavorable. I apologize. Nevertheless, if you had arrived a day later, we would have greeted you as blind corpses.”</p><p>“How could etiquette in war be the same as common civility? Let us not be concerned about such matters. There is not even the slightest reason for you to feel disconcerted, Duke Zepar.”</p><p>Rank 16th Zepar and&nbsp;I, who was rank 71st, conversed with one another while using a half-polite language. It may have gone against courtesy, but Zepar was the lord&nbsp;who had received salvation, and I was the lord who had given him that redemption. I was indirectly suggesting to him that this was what front line decorum was. Zepar must have understood my&nbsp;implication as he had nodded his head.</p><p>“Nevertheless, I feel quite ashamed to be welcoming you like this. What have we been doing while you, who possesses a low rank, were breaching through the mountain range and arriving to rescue us……?”</p><p>“Duke Zepar, what part of that is your mistake? Since the lords of the Plains Faction have protected the demon continent, which had risen to extremities, the people will most definitely praise your efforts. All I have merely done was to very slightly assist the lords in helping their subjects. Now then, let us go.”</p><p>While exchanging words of blessing, Zepar guided us to the campsite.</p><p>The encampment was solitary. It was a campsite that relied solely on wooden fences and trenches. The fences had broken apart due to the repeated attacks which had unfolded for the past several days. On the wooden pickets, corpses were impaled through the abdomen and were hanging like laundry. Birds of prey landed&nbsp;on the corpses and feasted on the most tender part of their flesh; the eyes. The blood oozed from the empty eye sockets of the blinded corpses. The moment we drew near, the birds flew away in alarm. As the birds fled, they dropped the torn apart eyeballs onto the earth. Zepar did not utter a word while going past the corpses of his men.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Witnessing my troops entering the camp, the soldiers who were still alive gathered. They cheered while raising their spears.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Hoorah for His Highness Dantalian! Hoorah!</p><p>— Blessings to our savior!</p><p>Ο</p><p>The soldiers blocked our path so we were unable to move here or there. It was infallible for the faces of the soldiers who had survived purgatory to be beautiful. They were missing limbs and teeth and were dirty because of the grime which was smeared all over them. If there was something about them that was beautiful, then it was the bright smile&nbsp;that had formed on their faces. Zepar scolded the officers and men.</p><p>“What is this? No matter how delighted you all are, it is custom to not block the path of a king. Quickly……”</p><p>“No, that is fine, Duke Zepar.”</p><p>I stopped him.</p><p>“It is a rule that a king who steps on the path of his people does not exist.”</p><p>I stepped down from my horse and embraced one of the soldiers. The soldier was a young orc. A&nbsp;strong pungent smell of horse feces, blood, and urine emanated from his body. I held the young orc close and kissed his forehead.</p><p>“You are all admirable. You are all praiseworthy. You all did a good job standing your ground. I am sorry that I was not able to arrive sooner. You did well……”</p><p>The soldier burst into tears. After hearing my words, the other soldiers around me started to shed tears as well. They knelt around me and drenched the ends of my clothes with their tears. They cried profusely while muttering ‘your…… highness……’. Zepar could not interfere with the soldiers who were crying because they had survived. That was something that one could not dare impede in.</p><p>While the sound of crying was overflowing from the camp, a sharp voice cut in.</p><p>“Hey! Tall and feeble!”</p><p>It was Barbatos. She&nbsp;was standing beyond the lowered backs of the soldiers.</p><p>Barbatos jumped. As if she was crossing over stepping stones, she stepped on the backs of her soldiers and ran all the way to me. Because her behavior had no face or dignity,&nbsp;I was taken aback and my mouth hung agape. Barbatos embraced the me who was like that.</p><p>“I’m fucking thankful, you son of a bitch!”</p><p>“Uwaack!”</p><p>I lost my balance and nearly fell over. Barbatos chortled as she hung onto my shoulders and dangled.</p><p>“You crazy bastard, you dog-like bastard! You bastard who really arrives within six days because he was told to come within six days! You, you! Did you crawl here within six days because the mountains are like your front yard? You pretty bastard!”</p><p>“Uaaaack!”</p><p>I was forcefully kissed. In truth, this was not kissing but suckling. There was no possibility that this was something beside suckling.</p><p>I, who had performed quite the romantic and dignified scene, was now twisting his neck in order to avoid displaying a public suckling exhibition. Barbatos’ lips frequently missed. Once that happened, this girl got upset for some reason.</p><p>“Ah, damn it. Stay still.”</p><p>“Euub!?”</p><p>Barbatos grabbed&nbsp;my head with both her hands. Finally, she was able to shove her tongue into my mouth. That was the moment where the suckling had turned into a deep kiss. For someone who had the appearance of that of a child, her kissing capability was extraordinarily peerless. First, she took my breath and made the inside of my mouth into a vacuum. Having been smothered, I lost the strength in my tongue. Barbatos then enveloped her tongue around mine and sucked on it. Our lips went astray for an instant. In that moment, I inhaled sharply while letting out the sound ‘Heub… ha…!’. This was also for an instant. Soon after, Barbatos plugged my mouth once more, and this time, she pressed the&nbsp;center of my tongue with hers and stimulated it. Strength drained from my&nbsp;joints. Barbatos lightly caught and supported my body which was about to collapse since my knees had buckled. I’m going to be raped. These words went through my head. Truly.&nbsp;<strong>I’m going to be raped today.&nbsp;</strong>I honestly believed that I was going to be violated just like this. Barbatos, who was pressing the center of my tongue with hers, then wrapped her tongue around both sides of my own. Letting out a ‘Eub…’, I moaned. Did I just utter that moan? Did I truly? Was I going to be done in by a single tongue? No matter how much I moved both of my arms in order to push the other party away, it was pointless. Because I was unable to put strength into my arms, my flailing slipped. Barbatos smirked with her eyes. ‘How cute’. It felt like Barbatos was saying that. As if telling me to stop fussing, Barbatos lightly gripped my lower body with her left hand. Dear God. My vision became white. My final line of resistance had disappeared without a trace as well. There was no way to struggle here. My knees trembled in fear from&nbsp;the technique of this perverted Demon Lord who had lived for hundreds of years. I could feel with my entire body what the term ‘being eaten’ meant. I am going to be eaten. That was a basic fear that humans retained towards beasts since the beginning of all things. I primitively trembled. God, please, just, seriously. Barbatos then mixed the techniques of pushing her tongue like a drill and capturing my tongue with hers like a rope together and stirred the inside of my mouth. It felt like a blender was whisking my brain.</p><div></div><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“—Paha.”</p><p>At last, Barbatos removed her lips. A thin line of saliva hung loosely like a suspension bridge between my and Barbatos’ tongue. While&nbsp;gasping heavily, I glared ferociously at Barbatos.</p><p>“You……you really……”</p><p>“Don’t try to shrewdly steal the hearts of my men.”</p><p>Barbatos bit my earlobe and whispered.</p><p>“I’m thankful that you saved me, but that’s it. Listen well. My soldiers are mine. The thing I despise the most are&nbsp;wastrels who mess with the things that are mine. Although this time, I’m letting you off with just this, but if you try to entice my subordinates ever again……”</p><p>Barbatos’ tongue&nbsp;licked the inner portion of my ear. That cold moist sensation sent a chill down my spine.</p><p>“Dantalian. At that moment, I’ll really violate you while in front of&nbsp;the watchful eyes of the soldiers.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Hiccup.</p><p>“Your response?”</p><p>“I-I’ll be careful.”</p><p>“Your plans tonight?”</p><p>Barbatos’ voice, which had asked me about my plans for tonight, was&nbsp;dripping with lust. If there was a color to one’s breath, then Barbatos’ breath would most likely be a light pink color right now. I hiccuped.</p><p>“Uh…… None?”</p><p>“Heeh. Then would you look at that? One was made just now.”</p><p>“Please wait a moment.&nbsp;Although I am unsure whether you are exhausted after having blocked the enemy’s continuous attack or not, how about getting some proper rest today?”</p><p>“Then since I’m tired, I guess I should improve my health by taking tonics?”</p><p>Gyaaaack.</p><p>“Every rational being in the world has the right of decision-making regarding their sexual behaviors within society. Barbatos, to your temptation, I shall adamantly refuse……”</p><p>“Deny all you want. I’ll just refuse your refusal.”</p><p>This was not right.</p><p>Barbatos grabbed my right hand and started to drag me along. As I was being dragged, it felt as if I had become a slave who was being sold to another household due to a bad harvest. It was miserable and miserable again.</p><p>Thousands of soldiers vacantly watched the sight of me being dragged away. It was obvious what was going to remain in the minds of the soldiers today. The scene of His Highness Dantalian embracing the dirty bodies of the soldiers and crying for them had already fluttered away and evaporated. Only a single scene will remain within the soldiers and they will laugh and talk about it all night.</p><p>‘Her Highness Barbatos had devoured His Highness Dantalian!’</p><p>Like so.</p><p>With my final bit of hope, I gazed at Lapis, Farnese, and the witches. All of them disregarded my gaze. The witches even waved their arms as if they were the people of Pyeongyang and were passionately seeing off their leader. The witches were beaming brightly.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Be eaten well, your highness!</p><p>Ο</p><p>If my ear holes were still working correctly, then that was what the witches had distinctly shouted. Damn it. Just what country’s custom and what world’s moral principle was the courtesy of selling off one’s master and telling him to be eaten well. Since the three fundamental principles in human relations had collapsed and the Olympic rings have vanished, I shall see it as something you all had committed. Confucius and Mencius shall curse you all. Go die. All of you go die……</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The Northern Guardian, Margrave of Rosenberg, Georg von Rosenberg</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 3, Day&nbsp;11</p><p>Neris Plains</p><p>Ο</p><p>The officers and men were unable to recognize me who had approached while walking with a cane. Even after I had shown the ring of the House of Rosenberg, the gatekeeper was still half in doubt. My appearance was dirty and shabby. Although I’m going to go and ask, don’t expect too much, the gatekeeper uttered this and went to inform the people above of my arrival.</p><p>After a long time, a captain arrived while holding a rope used to bind criminals. It was a captain who I was an acquaintance with. Unable to treat me as a criminal, the captain stammered.</p><p>“They said the crime of bringing us defeat was atrocious……”</p><p>“Did Her Highness the Imperial Princess order you to bind me?”</p><p>“My apologies, your honor.”</p><p>My throat was parched. I let out a dry cough. Ever since I was struck on the back of the head and had fallen into the snow, my coughs had become more frequent. This hacking cough which had found me after the age of 60 informed me of my age. The agedness I faced because I was old, was painful.</p><p>“What is there to apologize for. Tie me.”</p><p>“Please resent this captain.”</p><p>The captain bound both of my arms and guided me into the base. During the midday, the areas that the sunlight filled in the military base was vast. In each location where the sun shined down upon, soldiers were gathered and sharing small-talk. Once a captain started leading an elderly man bound by rope, the soldiers turned to look this way. Someone must have recognized my old bones since my name had started to spread immediately.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ο</p><p>— That’s the Margrave of Rosenberg.</p><p>— Well, the reason our position was taken the other day……</p><p>Ο</p><p>The officers and men whispered. It felt as if my body was completely in the open and my inner flesh was being revealed. The captain guided me not to the quarters used for war councils, but to the Imperial Princess’ personal tent instead.</p><p>“I have brought the defeated general, your highness.”</p><p>Defeated general.</p><p>I shuddered. The disgrace I felt now sunk into a deeper corner of my psyche than it did while walking in front of the soldiers.</p><p>The Imperial Princess did not respond. Her shadow could be faintly seen through the white tent fabric.</p><p>“Your highness.”</p><p>The captain called out once more. No response. Feeling perplexed, the captain turned to look at me. It appeared the captain did not have the courage to press on and call for Her Highness the Imperial Princess, who was like the sky, for the third time. I cleared my throat.</p><p>“Your highness, this one is here to bow his head.”</p><p>“Enter.”</p><p>A refined voice flowed out from the tent.</p><p>With the steps of a criminal, I entered the quarters. The Imperial Princess was sitting at a desk and dealing with documents. At&nbsp;the center of the tent, steam was rising from a bucket full of hot water.</p><p>Even after we had entered, the Imperial Princess continued to only touch the documents. It appeared that being in her highness’ tent for a long period of time was putting the captain under immense distress. Only the sound of a quill writing on parchment resonated throughout the tent. Even though time should be the same no matter what type of space you were in, the captain was unable to handle the time within this isolated space. The Imperial Princess spoke.</p><p>“You may leave now, captain.”</p><p>The captain quickly departed.</p><p>Only then, did the Imperial Princess stand up. Eyes that were as red as blood gazed at my face. There were no emotions there.</p><p>“Sir Rosenberg.”</p><p>“Yes, please speak, your highness.”</p><p>“Thou has lost.”</p><p>I dropped down to my knees.</p><p>“Do not forgive this one, your highness.”</p><p>“That is right. That is how you should behave. However, if I do not forgive you, then would the soldiers who have fallen come back to life? Would the penetrated mountain range be blocked once more? Our subjects, who have been burned to death, are still the people&nbsp;who have burned, and the soldiers, who have released the encirclement and have retreated, are still our soldiers who have fled.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Why did you lose?”</p><p>In full detail, I told her about everything that I knew.</p><p>The Imperial Princess silently listened to my words. After hearing everything, she uttered.</p><p>“I see, so that man is Dantalian.”</p><p>“How does your highness know of such……”</p><p>“An acquaintance of mine sent me some information. Have a look as well.”</p><p>The Imperial Princess pulled out a pocket watch from the inside of her clothes. Once she turned the hour hand of the clock, smoke started to leak out. A transparent screen was faintly displayed on the smoke. Memory Play artifact. It was a tool with an exorbitant price.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Turn this place into Hell.</p><p>— Aha? By ‘Hell’, does master mean?</p><p>—&nbsp;I can smell a scent somewhere. It is the smell of fat emanating from disgusting masses of flesh. It is the smell of greed and hypocrisy.</p><p>Ο</p><p>My eyes shot open. Dantalian’s figure appeared on the screen. He&nbsp;ordered for a slaughter and a countless number of humans were killed off. I held my breath. The Imperial Princess turned the artifact off and questioned me.</p><p>“How is it? You must have seen this Demon Lord in person.”</p><p>“Yes…… Without a doubt, that is Demon Lord Dantalian.”</p><p>“Is there no possibility that they had acquired a man with the same face as Dantalian&nbsp;and made him act as&nbsp;the Demon Lord? Also, is there no chance that they had hired a large group of mages to enact this performance while having disguised themselves?”</p><p>“The possibility of that being so is incredibly low. Your highness, this one recognizes&nbsp;the witch that appeared&nbsp;with the Demon Lord.”</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>“We had crossed swords several days ago. This one had even cut that girl down. If it were a performance, then it would be difficult to have a near identical appearance like that. Furthermore, the girl held within Dantalian’s arms is the Demon Lord’s general.”</p><p>The Imperial Princess placed her hand on her chin and went into thought.</p><p>“I had sent a person to Pavia to confirm this occurrence. Apparently, there was indeed an incident&nbsp;where the slave market was assaulted last autumn. The people of Pavia believe that it was the act of a wild demonic beast.”</p><p>“Your highness.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Demon Lord Dantalian most likely slaughtered the people deliberately, regardless of their race, in order to disguise the assault on the marketplace&nbsp;as an attack by beasts. Since both humans and demons had died indiscriminately, there was no other choice but to naturally see it as an act committed by demonic beasts.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“He is a cruel man, Sir Rosenberg.”</p><p>Cruel.</p><p>The Imperial Princess’ judgment was infinitely correct. Demon Lord Dantalian was a heartless man. There was no occasion of him having spared the lives of the humans he had captured as prisoners. If it were for victory, then he would calmly corner his subordinates into a deadly situation. Surely, without any room for doubt, Dantalian was a villain who was most suited for the title ‘Demon Lord’.</p><p>But why? Why did&nbsp;the scene I had witnessed, after having awoken from being unconscious, feel so sentimental? The scenery which I was uncertain on whether it was reality or a hallucination. Within the sunlight that was similar to fog, Dantalian and the girls were blended together like&nbsp;glares of light. That scene had become a single mystery and was imprinted into my cornea. The further I tried to push that scenery away from my head, the closer it got. However, even that closeness was too far for me to cross over. It felt as if that spot was nirvana.</p><p>“Rosenberg.”</p><p>“Yes, your highness.”</p><p>“Habsburg has already given you their faith once.”</p><p>The Imperial Princess lifted a dagger.</p><p>I slowly closed my eyes. I had come here resolute. The reason why I had not committed suicide was because my individuality considered suicide as an inviolable act. As&nbsp;dying voluntarily was one’s own duty, it was something tremendously extravagant for a traitor who had disgraced his race and ruined his country. My death was no longer my own, and must be the punishment from the country. I have come here to die.</p><p>“Your Highness. Enact your justice.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Unexpectedly, the sound of empty laughter reached my ears.</p><p>The blade sliced into the air and cut the rope, freeing both of my hands. Feeling strange that my neck had not been severed yet, I opened my eyes. In front of me, the Imperial Princess was smiling.</p><p>“I am not going to take your life.”</p><p>“Your highness……?”</p><p>“Your body is&nbsp;exceedingly&nbsp;dirty. Why is the margrave, which we only have four of in our empire, not properly maintaining his garment? The basis of one’s mind is in their body, and the basis of one’s body is in their clothes, so if the clothes are messy, then that reveals that the person’s mind is disorderly as well.”</p><p>The Imperial Princess undid my collar. Although I tried to back away, the Imperial Princess firmly gripped the edge of my clothes. It was disconcerting. There was no possibility that the Imperial Princess would desire for this old body, so I could not figure out the reason behind her current action.</p><p>“It is an order.”</p><p>“As a vassal, how could……”</p><p>“Were you ever my vassal? Regardless, since you are a criminal of the empire, it would be difficult for you to oppose my words. Or perhaps, will you refuse the words of a lord with the body of a criminal?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>I could not resist.</p><p>The Imperial Princess’ white hands went over my chest. As the buttons came undone, my coat slipped off.</p><p>Unbefitting of a lady who was born in the Royal Palace, the Imperial Princess’ hands were rough. I vaguely recalled the rumor that from a young age the Imperial Princess had learned how to catch fish from a fisherman, was taught how to hunt birds from a hunter, and learned how to plow fields from a farmer. The aristocrats talked in whispers that it was the Imperial Princess’ eccentric behaviors. The Imperial Princess’ fingers were coarse. This rough sensation proved that the Imperial Princess’ eccentric behaviors were not simply an act of delinquency because of a young age. While enduring the luxury of the Imperial Princess unclothing me, which was not a luxury, I spoke.</p><p>“Your highness, the alligator……”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“How did your highness learn how to butcher an alligator?”</p><p>“I saw the chef doing it in the Royal Palace.”</p><p>“Did the head cook teach your highness?”</p><p>“No. I did not receive any lessons. I merely watched.”</p><p>The Imperial Princesse&nbsp;pulled the wooden bucket close and dipped a washcloth into it. I was dumbstruck.</p><p>“Is your highness telling this one that you had learned the method of wielding the blade to skin&nbsp;leather through observation alone?”</p><p>“It is generally like that for me.”</p><p>With a splash, the Imperial Princess washed my body with the washcloth. My skin was arid and dry so it received the hot water well. I felt my skin breathing with gasps. As it continued to breathe, my mind became relaxed. The Imperial Princess comforted my&nbsp;exhausted back and shoulders with the towel.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-326.jpg?w=700\"></p><p>Behind my back, the Imperial Princess spoke.</p><p>“Your body tells me of your life. It is proof that you have lived not with your head, but with your body.”</p><p>“That is something indecent for a criminal to hear. Please refrain from speaking such words, your highness.”</p><p>“Where did you acquire this stab wound on your back?”</p><p>“That is a scar this one had gained when this one was 18-years-old and had gone to a battlefield for the first time. While this one was running away in fear, this one was cut by a nameless person.”</p><p>“Aha. If it is 18-years-old, then that is the same as my current age.”</p><p>Although it was impious, a small laughter flowed from my lips. It was surprising that the Imperial Princess was 18-years-old and strange that I was already past the age of 60. Since the legacy I had walked down from the age of 18 to 60 was so distant, I laughed obscurely. This was something which I could only laugh vaguely about.</p><p>“Though the numbers could be nearly the same, this one does not believe that your highness’ feats can be approached by others.”</p><p>“You have yielded your allegiance to the Imperial Family for the past 60 years and have been faithful to your people for that long as well, but it seems merely being defeated twice is enough to ruin you. I will console your body.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Your&nbsp;humiliation is your own&nbsp;and is something which I cannot cleanse. Therefore, since I cannot clean your mind, consider the thought that I am consoling you by cleansing your body. The path of consideration will at least not be solitary.”</p><p>I narrowed my eyes.</p><p>As the water flowed, hot steam rose upwards. The steam filled the tent like smoke. The smell of skin emanated from the steam. Whether the alligator, which had its skin peeled off personally by the Imperial Princess’ hands, had enjoyed a deep luxury as an animal, or if I was enjoying a deeper luxury for having my body cleaned by the Imperial Princess as a vassal. I could not decide on which of those two were superior. While receiving the warm steam, I spoke.</p><p>“What should this one do?”</p><p>“I will lead the knights and withdraw. It is highly unlikely that Barbatos will leave us alone as we retreat. Her viciousness has most likely piled up&nbsp;to the point where she wishes to return to us all the beatings her forces had received up till now in full. You will block our rear.”</p><p>“Is your highness telling this one to die while&nbsp;defending?”</p><p>“I will not stop you.”</p><p>My body trembled.</p><p>The Imperial Princess brushed my shoulders with her bare hands. Because her coarse palms had grazed my skin, my inner flesh itched as well.</p><p>“However, it will not only be you. My brother shall be there as well. If you let the Crown Prince of the Empire die,&nbsp;then you will most likely become known as a traitor for all of eternity. But, if you are able to safely bring the Crown Prince southwards, then would that not also be a great meritorious deed?”</p><p>“……Is your highness giving this one an opportunity?”</p><p>“I simply wish to give you an appropriate location.”</p><p>The Imperial Princess remarked.</p><p>“Even if you are to lose this time as well, I shall not punish the northern region. I swear on the name of Habsburg, so&nbsp;leave while bearing all of your humiliation alone.”</p><p>This was an extravagance that a criminal could not hope more for.</p><p>I lowered my head.</p><p>“These old bones will carry out your order, your highness.”</p>"

Barbatos should also not be&nbsp;completely fine due to the exhaustion, but during the night, during this ambitious night where even the sound of birds could not be heard, she had woken me up. For reference, the people I despise the most in the world are the ones who wake me up while I am asleep. People who wake up others are all psychopaths and mental patients. I will accept no arguments.</p><p>“Is something the matter?”</p><p>“Follow me quietly.”</p><p>Barbatos lowered her voice and giggled. Although she had told me to follow her, she abruptly grabbed my hand and started to drag me along. Barbatos and I were currently in the state where we did not have even a single scrap of thread on us, thus meaning, we were naked. My God. Barbatos was trying to drag me outside the quarters while we were in the nude. I had no choice but to be shocked here.</p><p>“Hey, are you insane?”</p><p>“I’ll show you something good.”</p><p>“I don’t know what it is, but I can’t go outside while naked!”</p><p>“I told you to be quiet, you idiot.”</p><p>Barbatos continued to chuckle. She was a girl without a grain of sense. The heinous part about this girl was the fact that while she was senseless, her grip strength was also needlessly powerful. Where in that small physique of hers did this strength come from? When Barbatos dragged me along, I would helplessly be pulled along like a piece of straw drifting down a river. Oh Lord. This crazy bitch really did drag me outside the tent!</p><p>It was late into the night, so the encampment was quiet. Only the sparsely spread out torches held by the guards on patrol flickered in the distance. I let out a shriek.</p><p>“Save me, the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy!”</p><p>“Sheesh, shut up a bit, will you? You really do disregard what other people say, don’t you?”</p><p>“Are you saying that to me? Aang? Is that something you’re saying to me right now?”</p><p>“Oh,&nbsp;Embers of Solace.”</p><p>Barbatos blew her breath into her palm. Barbatos then touched my face, neck, shoulder, chest, and bottom, with her right hand. The moment she did so, a warm heat spread from the areas which Barbatos had touched. The savagely cold winter night had become as warm as the evening during the early autumn. The sleet that was fluttering through the air all melted before they could reach my skin.</p><p>“Now, is that better?”</p><p>“Thanks, you have my gratitude. I’m really thankful, but a more fundamental problem, do you not think that there’s perhaps a more fundamental problem?”</p><p>“The fact that you’re ugly?”</p><p>“This fucker……”</p><p>“Shit, I’m bringing you along to show you something good, so just follow me. It’d be fine if only your lower tool was long, but your mouth is fucking long too. Your tongue is so lengthy that you could probably make a farm on it, you limp dick bastard. Should I tear your trap out and shove it up your ass, you inept shit?&nbsp;The bastard who’d flap his asshole every time he opens his mouth and also make the smell of feces&nbsp;drift from the North Sea to the White Sea is you, you son of a bitch. Hm? Don’t make me turn that shit hole into a diarrhea hole and make you leak shitty water every time you walk, you amateur. Fucking shut your mouth and follow me.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Going head on against Barbatos in a battle of curses&nbsp;was an incredibly foolish thing to do.</p><p>Since I was an individual who had acquainted myself&nbsp;with proper education and beautiful refinement since the earliest days of my&nbsp;life, furthermore, because profanity was another world’s language, I could only helplessly be dragged away by the hands of the villainess known as Barbatos. What am I to do against Barbatos’ divine grace of profanities that contained 500 years of her labor. If it was a sin to have been born kind, then I was that sinner. I treated my crime with sympathy.</p><p>Barbatos led&nbsp;me to the outside of the military base. We were nearly caught by the patrols several times. While avoiding the guards, we had made twists and turns through the military camp. During that time,&nbsp;Barbatos would occasionally turn around and kiss me for absolutely no reason. Barbatos was a girl who kissed when she felt like kissing. I could only surrender.</p><p>Due to the snow, the outside of the encampment had become a white&nbsp;field. Corpses were buried in the snow field, and above those bodies, more snow fell and pushed them a layer deeper into the ground. After we had reached this spot, Barbatos let go of my hand.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Okay. What do you plan to do here……?”</p><p>Barbatos walked towards the snow-covered field by herself.</p><p>Towards the night sky where the snow drifted down from, Barbatos spread out her arms. She started to sing. Wondering what sort of action that was during the middle of the night, I stared at the girl.</p><p>It was a song that flowed with no lyrics but only sound.</p><p>Barbatos gazed up at the sky as if she was a saintess receiving the epiphany of God, and as she walked out towards the boundlessly vast snowy fields, she pulled the blizzard into her arms as if she was going to disappear forever.</p><p>It was difficult to distinguish the snow-covered field with Barbatos’ pure white naked body.</p><p>Her song felt as if it were coming from the blizzard and not her vocal cords, and the blizzard felt as it was weeping in the distant winter sky.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Winter was wailing in that spot. The cold cries of winter easily pierced through the warmth that was covering my skin. My neck became cold.</p><p>Putting more strength into her vocal cords, Barbatos’ song slowly became more powerful. Barbatos opened her mouth wide and kept her eyes narrowed. She received the blizzard that came down from above with her melody, and made the wind surge back upwards. It felt as if her voice had entered a vocal range that my ears could not handle.</p><p>Ah–…… the snowy wind carried this noise. Carried by the wind, from this side of the snowy earth to the other side, to the edge of the forest of hyun poplars, to the wolf that&nbsp;had poked its&nbsp;head out of the woods and was silently watching us, to the gaps between the wolf’s teeth, to the corpses that had their faces shoved into the frozen earth, to the eyes of the bodies where the blood had froze, from there to here, and to even the areas that were further than those places and were isolated, the blizzard crawled into those locations and the melody seeped into them as well.</p><p><em>Thuck.</em></p><p>From below the snowy earth, the rotten arm of a corpse rose up. Pieces of flesh were torn&nbsp;from the arm revealing the bone. Even the speck of snow that was on the bone could be seen. With a ‘thuck’, the sound made when one stepped&nbsp;on snow echoed low throughout the area. Thuck, thuck, each time this sound resonated, arms surged up from the snow. As if they were trying to grab something, the frozen hands waved through the empty air. Hundreds, thousands of hands clawed at the sky.</p><p>Barbatos’ song slowly&nbsp;came to an end. With her at the center, a countless number of dead arms had erupted from the snow. Gazing around at the skeletons, Barbatos spoke.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—All of you. Return&nbsp;to life.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Were they waiting for that single line?</p><p>The arm movements of the corpses stopped. In the empty space where there was nothing, the arms clenched their fists. As the corpses stood up, puffs of snow scattered as well. Once thousands of piles of snow scattered at the same time, the blizzard became more severe, and then, it slowly settled down. Once it had calmed down, there were thousands of corpses standing on the snow-covered field.</p><p>Barbatos let out a breath. Her visible white breath flowed from between her lips. I gawked at her.</p><p>“How was it?”</p><p>Barbatos remarked.</p><p>“Despite the slight cold, it was a good idea to follow me, right?”</p><p>“……What did you do just now?”</p><p>“Hm? Replenishing troops.”</p><p>Barbatos answered immediately.</p><p>Replenishing troops? How could this be supplementing troops!? Was this not an utterly insane girl?</p><p>Ο</p><p>I had just now witnessed the certain point in ability that I will never be able to reach no matter how much I struggle. I had also witnessed the reason behind why the social system, that was similar to that of tribes, had not collapsed within the demon world yet. Demon Lords were not only lords, but they were priests, shamans, and saints. Other demons were obedient because of that terrifying force contained within that divine name.</p><p>One day, my authority may become great&nbsp;enough to allow me to control the lives of others as I desire. However, I will&nbsp;be&nbsp;unable to control the things which have no lives. My political ability would suddenly become courteous when within the presence of Barbatos’ own capabilities. How was I to take this? How was I to conquer this? Unsure of how I was going to accept you, I asked.</p><p>“Barbatos, who are you?”</p><p>Barbatos placed her lips on the corpses. She did not distinguish the corpses with torn flesh and the skeletons that had lost their flesh. She blessed all the corpses with a kiss. A gust of snow blew through the field. With a corpse’s head held in her hands, Barbatos turned only her head to look at me.</p><p>She grinned.</p><p>“A bitch.”</p><p>And thus, the&nbsp;army of skeletons advanced.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The Northern Guardian, Margrave of Rosenberg, Georg von Rosenberg</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 3, Day&nbsp;12</p><p>Neris Plains, Imperial Army Encampment</p><p>Ο</p><p>The enemy had arrived at the end of the field which was enshrouded by a fog of snow.</p><p>It&nbsp;was night. Hearing that the scout had arrived to give their report, I walked outside. The blizzard and fog had mixed together making it difficult to distinguish anything in front of me. The scout was breathing heavily.</p><p>“I saw it. General, I have witnessed it. I am certain. Corpses, frozen corpses were approaching like a swarm. Aah, I saw it……”</p><p>I brushed the snow off of the scout’s shoulder. Within the House of Rosenberg, the records of war written by our ancestors were passed down throughout the generations. The report that the scout had briefed was accurate to the characteristic which described Demon Lord Barbatos. There was nothing strange about it.</p><p>“Do not worry. I believe you.”</p><p>“You believe that, Sir Rosenberg? Do you truly believe those foolish words?”</p><p>The Crown Prince, who had quickly arrived after hearing about the urgent report, laughed in ridicule. The Crown Prince was currently wearing his sleepwear and had a fur cloak draped over his shoulders. I wonder if he had spent the entire evening drinking since his neck and his cheeks were red.</p><p>“I see that due to your age, the praise of you being a great commander is an antique now. Put yourself together, Rosenberg. How could corpses possibly move?”</p><p>“The enemy leader is Demon Lord Barbatos. In the records of the previous holy war, there are many passages of Barbatos having used black arts to control the dead.”</p><p>“Ah, those records are probably wrong. You should think using common sense. This great one may be drunk, but I am looking at the world properly, while it seems you are sober, and yet, looking at the world in reverse. It is a problem that occurs when you have not drunk alcohol. Now then, some alcohol. Let us go and enjoy a drink together.”</p><p>“Your Highness the Crown Prince.”</p><p>“Oho? Are you saying that you won’t receive a glass from me?”</p><p>“How could this one possibly……? &nbsp;I merely wish to protect the Crown Prince from the enemy demons.”</p><p>“Can a person who was unable to defend a single wall, be able to protect me?”</p><p>The Crown Prince made an invidious remark. I closed my mouth.</p><p>“I am joking. Do not be upset.”</p><p>“Your words are immeasurable, your honor.”</p><p>“Oh dear, you really do plan to not drink with me. Even though you, Sir Rosenberg, are the person who needs alcohol the most. This great one is worried. I am sincerely concerned, Sir Rosenberg. How could you possibly endure your world without alcohol?”</p><p>“This one plans to persevere through what must be endured.”</p><p>The Crown Prince took a bottle of alcohol out from his fur coat. Due to the Crown Prince being intoxicated, the bottle slipped from his hands. The bottle fell into&nbsp;the snow, so it did not break. Oh dear, this precious thing…… the Crown Prince uttered and made a fuss. He blew away the snow that had stuck onto the bottle. This precious precious thing…</p><p>I tried to glare through the blizzard, but I could see nothing. Although I was unable to see anything, I ordered the captains to organize the troops. The soldiers that the Imperial Princess had left behind were all either old and frail&nbsp;or were individuals who were so tired and sick that they were unable to overcome the cold night. The officers and men had put their crossbows on the ground&nbsp;and were rubbing their palms against their legs. Ah, it’s so cold that I could die…… the old soldiers whined. The sound of ah…… ah…… mixed together with the noise made by the snowy wind.</p><p>The Crown Prince asked.</p><p>“So, did Elizabeth tell you to die as well?”</p><p>“Her Highness the Imperial Princess had told this one that she would provide this one an appropriate location.”</p><p>“Oh? Is that location within the Imperial Family?”</p><p>“This one does not know.”</p><p>“Then you’ll die not knowing.”</p><p>The Crown Prince spoke flatly.</p><p>“Elizabeth is a devil. I know that she is a devil. Have you ever stared into those pure red eyes of hers for a long time? I have. I could smell blood. She’s a girl who makes the smell of blood flow wherever she gazes……”</p><p>I abruptly became curious. How was the Imperial Princess’ childhood? Was the Imperial Princess still the Imperial Princess when she was young? Was she like this since the beginning? I coughed. There was a wet sensation to that cough. Due to my experience, I knew that it was a bad omen when a dry cough would suddenly turn into a wet cough.</p><p>“Your honor, did something happen in the palace?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“……”</p><p>The Crown Prince gulped down his alcohol without a word. Although the Crown Prince was looking towards the same direction as myself, it did not feel as if we were looking at the same location. It seemed that to the Crown Prince, the blizzard that was raging before us&nbsp;appeared like an illusion. The Crown Prince spoke.</p><p>“It’s my sin.”</p><p>The Crown Prince said nothing more after that.</p><p>The Crown Prince, Rudolf von Habsburg, was inferior to his little sister on all sides. The rebellion that the Crown Prince was unable to suppress for 7 months with an army of 5,000, was swept away within 15 days by the Imperial Princess’ army of 1,000. The ancient language, that the Crown Prince had become proficient with at the age of 14,&nbsp;was mastered by the Imperial Princess by the age of 5. As the misgovernment of His Majesty the Emperor continued, the nobles started to wish for a competent monarch. The Crown Prince was ideal.</p><p>“Do you see it?”</p><p>The Crown Prince muttered.</p><p>Unsure of what I was supposed to be seeing, I looked at the Crown Prince. He was glancing down obliquely at the blizzard which&nbsp;was raging at the bottom of the hill.</p><p>“Someone has come.”</p><p>The haze of dawn barely touched the lower region of the hill. A skeletal leg came out from within the blizzard. The skeleton’s feet lightly stepped on the sloping path enshrouded by haze. As it took another step forward, the shape of a bone foot was left imprinted into the snow&nbsp;in the spot where the foot was previously at.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—……</p><p>Ο</p><p>At the bottom of the slope, the skeleton looked up at us. It appeared as if it had the gaze&nbsp;of a wanderer who&nbsp;was carefully examining the mountain range which they now had to climb. Though the skeleton had no eyes, I could feel its gaze. It was a cold and transparent gaze. The Crown Prince let a laugh flow into the snowy wind.</p><p>“A lot has arrived, huh?”</p><p>From the fog mixed with snow, thousands of corpses started to pour out. Aiming for our forces’ encampment, the corpses slowly ascended the hill. The sound of a horn echoed from our base. The roosters were startled by the horns and started to crow. Once the crying of the birds, which seemed as if it would never stop, had finally ceased, the blizzard raged powerfully once more and concealed the skeletons. Nothing was visible through the flurry of snow. Nothing could be seen, and yet, our troops raised their spears and crossbows.</p><p>“It’s winter, I see!”</p><p>The Crown Prince bellowed loudly. He cupped his hand around his mouth to amplify the sound and shouted in a loud voice.</p><p>“It’s winter! Winter is coming!”</p><p>Our soldiers feared the Crown Prince’s lunacy. It felt as if the Crown Prince was not informing the soldiers that the corpses have arrived, but instead, he was calling for those corpses to approach us&nbsp;with haste. The Crown Prince tipsily pulled out a long sword and raised it into the air.</p><p>“All forces, charge! Chaaaaarge!”</p><p>The Crown Prince leaped over the wooden fence and started to run. All forces, follow meeee… this sound of the Crown Prince echoed widely. Do not fear death, men–… The soldiers stayed in place. Uncertain of what they were supposed to do, they glanced at one another and then turned to look at me. The Crown Prince’s figure disappeared into the snowy fog.</p><p>Shortly after.</p><p>The Crown Prince returned from the fog. He was breathing heavily. After pushing himself through the crevice in the wooden fences with difficulty, he walked to where I was. Lowering his sword down, the Crown Prince raised his shoulders conceitedly.</p><p>“Wow, not a single person came. It seems they don’t have any intention to fight.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Let us just withdraw, general.”</p><p>Turning back to the captains, I ordered.</p><p>“Roll the boulders!”</p><p>The captains repeated the order. The boulders, which we had prepared beforehand, started to roll downwards. Due to the fact that the boulders were unable to roll properly, they often tumbled&nbsp;down towards a completely random direction, however, since there were plenty of undead in those random locations anyway, the directions they rolled could not be called entirely random. The stones collided against the skeletons and shattered their bones into pieces.</p><p>“What. Why do they listen to the general’s words but disregard the commands of a lord? These guys are really discriminating people. Once I return to the capital, I’ll punish them as rebels.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>The battle was heated since dawn.</p><p>Though our soldiers were old, they had that much experience as well. Since they had seen more surprising things during their lives, the veteran soldiers were not alarmed by the march of skeletons. Although there was a soldier who had run away, no one tried to stop them. The veteran soldiers seemed to have understood that even if one were to flee on their own out into the lonely snowy plains, they would either die from hunger, freeze to death&nbsp;or be eaten by beasts. The old soldiers chewed on the stale bread, which was distributed as breakfast, for a long time and swallowed it down with water.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Once all the boulders had fallen, the old soldiers drew their crossbows. Crossbows were ranged weapons that absorbed the magical energy from their surroundings and fired out bolts using that energy. The projectiles flew unnaturally if the weapon was fired too quickly, and would recoil heavily and cause the bolt to go astray if fired too late. The captains did not have to separately give instructions to fire since the veteran soldiers could shoot the crossbows while making rough assumptions of the timing in their heads. The bolts fired by the old soldiers flew quickly and firmly pierced their targets.</p><p>As they had lived according to their own discretion, they fought according to their discretion as well. The way they fought was similar to the natural physiology of the people.&nbsp;……So the people are fighting. The ones who are fighting are the people. I deeply inhaled the cold winter air.</p><p>“Heed my words, captains!”</p><p>The captains immediately stood in a close single file line. They were aged captains. They were old soldiers who had grown old in low-grade military bases because they either had a humble status, had insignificant&nbsp;capabilities, or were unable to stand in a line properly. As the majority of them were people born in the north, they were also thrown away here due to the reason that they were born in the north. Since their spines had not rusted yet, they held their backs up straight.</p><p>“Schleiermacher.”</p><p>“Yes, your honor.”</p><p>I called out each of the captain’s name. A&nbsp;captain whose beard was still brown stood forward and raised military rites. He was the second little brother to&nbsp;the minor official that managed the&nbsp;mill which was in my territory. During my youth, back when I was sharing a childhood crush with a maiden in the village, I stood guard at the mill.</p><p>“Currently, the military strength of&nbsp;our central force&nbsp;is no more than 2,000. No matter what the cost, you must not allow the front to be breached by those corpses. Do you understand? Defend your position till your last breath.”</p><div></div><p>“As you command, margrave.”</p><p>“Hold on for as long as possible. The chances of our retreating comrades being able to survive will increase the longer we withstand. The North shall not send your death to oblivion.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>The captain headed out with his servants in tow. In the distance, we could hear the faint sound of the captain shouting at his soldiers through the snow. The other remaining captains had their ears turned to that voice.</p><p>“Sir Roenbach.”</p><p>“Yes, general.”</p><p>A middle-aged man wearing silver armor walked forward. In this location, this man was the only one to have not been born in the North. Although his name was all he had left, he was once the leader of the Royal Knight Guards for the Emperor. There were 6 knights in our current forces and they had 20 valets following them. They were the last remaining knights here.</p><p>“While leading the knights, skim over the slope and sweep away any undead that protrudes excessively. Your duty is to prevent the corpses from reaching even 50 meters from our fences. Defend the front line with your lives, and fall at the front line.”</p><p>“I shall carry out your orders, general.”</p><p>“The North shall not forget your death.”</p><p>“I, Roenbach, shall achieve glory.”</p><p>The knight leader adjusted his helmet on his head and mounted his horse. The other knights gathered around their leader. The warhorses, which belonged to a good descent, were letting out heated breaths even within this cold wind. The knights lowered their heads towards my direction once, and then they did it once more towards the Crown Prince. The Crown Prince bobbed his head. He did not utter a single word of complaint about me using the knights as I pleased. The Crown Prince merely stared at the blizzard with drunk eyes. One by one, I called each captain’s name.</p><p>“Bergmann, I shall put 20 heavy infantries under your command. If there is a portion of our defenses that seems to be in danger, go there and fight.”</p><p>“Yes, your honor!”</p><p>Decades ago, during the year of famine, the young boy who had once displayed his innocence by shyly claiming that he had hunted a pheasant in worry that the young master was starving, had now turned into an old captain and responded.</p><p>“Gebauer, gather the servants and distribute projectiles to all of our soldiers. Furthermore, hand out the rest of our provisions to our officers and men. People fight&nbsp;with the strength provided by food.”</p><p>“I shall serve as needed, your honor.”</p><p>The girl who had enlisted in the military despite her gender,&nbsp;the girl who was frequently mocked by the men, and at one time, had retorted in a loud voice questioning where the males and females of the North were, was now replying to my commands here in this location after many decades had passed.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Mighty soldiers of Habsburg, listen to my words.”</p><p>I turned towards the troops.</p><p>“I do not know who you all have sworn your loyalty to, and I do not believe that loyalty is required when your meals are on the line. However, all of you should know. The duty of a person and the task of a soldier, these are things that you all should know well. If we flee, then the youths of our country will die. If we yield, then our country’s land will be set ablaze. Oh, great soldiers&nbsp;of Habsburg, who were once young and have always lived in these lands, it is time for us to pass down the things which we have enjoyed to our sons and daughters.”</p><p>I unsheathed my sword and raised it to the sky. The formal dress-sword, which had been passed down for generations within my family, was lost in the previous battle. But why did that matter? I lived on the battlefield. This was my home. This was where the House of Rosenberg was at.</p><p>I cried out. The heat from my gut surged upwards, burning and piercing through my wet coughs, and exploded in the winter atmosphere.</p><p>“For the Empire!”</p><p>The soldiers raised their crossbows and spears and shouted back fervently.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— For the Empire!</p><p>Ο</p><p>While hoping for my voice to reach the other side of ranks, that could not be seen due to the fog and snow, I roared.</p><p>“For the Empire!”</p><p>The soldiers reciprocated.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— For the Empire!</p><p>Ο</p><p>The voices from the other side of the base, which was concealed by the flurry, reached where I stood as well. The aged soldiers, who were born from different places and lived their lives differently, were going to die together at the end of their lives in the same location. The snowflakes, which had all respectively formed within different temperatures and were carried by&nbsp;diverse winds, all fell to the same floor and subsided. To live like a snowflake and to, at last, die like a snowflake. The snow that melted first in order to prevent the snow, which was going to stack on top of them, from melting. I gladly accepted all the snow with similar lives and all the snow with similar deaths. The North was a country of snow. A home that was established for the people who were unable to go south. Turning my face towards the sky, I let out a sigh. This was a day well suited for wailing. A good day to wail……</p><p>At forenoon, a captain came running to me.</p><p>“Your honor, the first line has been breached. The remnant soldiers of the first line have joined the second line. Fortunately, there was little confusion during the momentary retreat. Although many were injured, few were killed.”</p><p>“Good. Continue to defend as so.”</p><p>While glancing down at the map, I gave the order. The blizzard was fierce so it was impossible to perceive the military camp with one’s eyes alone. While drawing the things that could be seen and could not be seen on the map, I felt my way towards a direction and made assumptions as to where our soldiers had to go.</p><p>“We are already winning just by being able to hold out like this. Do not fight hastily, and do not die quickly. Endure for as long as you can. Instruct this to the troops once more.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>After a while, an orderly ran in. The orderly was the captain’s adjutant. Since the captain had fallen in battle, the adjutant was doing the captain’s task in their stead. I did not ask where the captain had fallen, and the adjutant did not tell me as well.</p><p>“General, the second group has been breached. The second and third line have joined together and are resisting the enemy. Our morale has yet to diminish. The leader of the knight corps has fallen.”</p><p>“Very well. On your way back, inform company commander Gebauer to abandon her given task and participate on the front line. Fight while abiding your time, but move with haste. By moving quickly, you will be able to fight less.”</p><p>“Understood, general!”</p><p>Once it had become midday, around the time the blizzard had ceased, an orderly ran in. Once again, it was a completely different person. On the next occasion, the orderly had died and nearly all of the other captains had fallen, so the only ones who could run in to report were now the adjutant’s servants. The messenger gave a very punctual salute and gave the situation report.</p><p>“The third line has been breached. Our whole army is fighting back at the final wooden barricade. Although the ranks of the unit are disorderly and assimilated, there are no issues in fighting together as a group.”</p><p>“Good. I command the remaining knights to charge. If you utilize the narrow pathway between the fences, then the charge should be easy to carry out. Strike the flanks of the enemy who are engrossed in our side.”</p><p>“Understood, your honor. May we achieve fortune in war.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Then a different soldier, and a different soldier……</p><p>Finally.</p><p>Everything had become still because there was no longer anyone in my surrounding.</p><p>Like a person of the North, the captains had struggled till their very last moments. We did not capture the soldiers who fled, and since we did not catch them, I believed that more had stayed. In the Royal Knight Guard, from the royal knights to the knight servants, all of them had died in battle heroically. During the final assault, the Crown Prince went forward with the troops without a word. I did not ask how the Crown Prince had died, and no one had told me how he had died either. The final messenger to give me the battle report was not a captain, not an adjutant, and was not even an adjutant’s servant. The last report was given by a soldier who did not have a rank. The soldier informed me that the final line had been breached and immediately headed back out to the front.</p><p>“……”</p><p>While receiving the serene midday sun on my back, I stared down at the map.</p><p>The sunlight melted the frozen waste, spreading a foul damp smell throughout the camp. It was the breath that had flowed from the Heavens. Since snow descended from the sky, and this was the scent that was emitted when that snow had melted, it felt as if this was the smell of the sky.&nbsp;……Was the country of snow the country of the sky? Were the people of the snow the people of the sky? Was that the reason why the people of snow&nbsp;returned to the sky so easily?</p><p>My back became heated because of the sunlight. While taking in the damp scent, I recalled the time the Imperial Princess had washed my body. I was not completely ignorant in regards to the reason behind why the Imperial Princess had discarded both the Crown Prince and myself in this location.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— What should this one do?</p><p>— You will block our rear.</p><p>—&nbsp;Is your highness telling this one to die while defending?</p><p>— I will not stop you. However,&nbsp;it will not only be you. My brother shall be there as well. If you let the Crown Prince of the Empire die,&nbsp;then you will most likely become known as a traitor for all of eternity.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Become an eternal traitor.</p><p>The Imperial Princess was saying that.</p><p>People whispered among one another that Margrave Georg von Rosenberg was the origin to the start of this war. Margrave Rosenberg lost the Black Mountains and ruined the Empire’s plan to end this battle with a short war. Furthermore, Rosenberg was now unable to protect the Crown Prince&nbsp;from death and will thus shake the courtroom of the Empire. Therefore, while shouldering all the crimes and tasks by himself,&nbsp;Georg will collapse and be submerged in the frozen waste, that is how you will contribute greatly; this was the Imperial Princess’ true words. Feeling blinded by that immense Imperial grace, I asked the Imperial Princess.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—&nbsp;Is your highness giving this one an opportunity?</p><p>—&nbsp;I simply wish to give you an appropriate location.&nbsp;Leave while bearing all of your humiliation alone.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Although it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;devil’s offer, at the same time,&nbsp;it was the only path to saving the Empire so it was an undeniable&nbsp;offer.</p><p>……The Imperial Princess has truly given an appropriate place to&nbsp;this old bag of bones. As this region was my home and my country&nbsp;and was the place where the people will reside and reside again, her highness had seen through this.</p><p>A shadow entered from behind my back. The shadow stepped on the snow. While making an indistinct sound, the snow received the weight of the life&nbsp;which stepped on them.</p><p>“Hm. Are you Georg von Rosenberg?”</p><p>“That is so.”</p><p>I continued to stare at the map. Each map was a place where people had died. I thought of the people who had fought similar to the ways they had lived. I thought of their coarse and firm hands that pulled the triggers on the crossbows. Even after they had fired the bolt, they continued to pull the wire. Shoot and pull again, they continued to pull.&nbsp;The battle continued on as long as life persisted, and it felt as if I was nothing more than the single instant that proved that endless continuation.</p><p>“The battle is over, human child. What are you looking at?”</p><p>“The battle.”</p><p>“And if that battle is over as well, what will you look at?”</p><p>“The battle.”</p><p>The sound of metal approached and severed the winter air.</p><p>……So this is the sound of my life being cut.</p><p>I thought as so. I wonder if the flesh diverged more delicately than the air since I could not hear the sound of it being severed. My vision was flipped and flipped several more times until I was eventually staring up towards the sky. That was the place where I will turn to. I closed my eyes.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Since I cannot cleanse your mind, consider the thought that I am consoling you by cleansing your body. The path of consideration will at least not be solitary.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ο</p><p>I shall contemplate the meaning and contemplate once more. However, since the country of snow was the country of the sky, one day, they will return to the earth and pile up once again, thus continuing their pitiful lives. The thing which consoled me were those poor lives&nbsp;and was immensely more comforting than your highness’ consideration.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-354.jpg?w=1400\"></p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Your Imperial grace is immeasurable, your highness.</p><p>Please treat us subjects with sympathy.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st,&nbsp;Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 3, Day&nbsp;12</p><p>Naris Plains, Imperial Army Encampment</p><p>Ο</p><p>“……”</p><p>I gazed down at the head of Rosenberg which had fallen to the snow-covered ground.</p><p>Rosenberg was still looking forward with narrowed eyes. Things were most likely no longer visible in those eyes and things were most likely unable to be appreciated by those eyes anymore. Regardless, Rosenberg will forever point towards a direction with that frozen gaze. After I turned my head to follow his eyes, I saw the sky. I muttered.</p><p>“Go to a good place, margrave.”</p><p>I lifted up Rosenberg’s head from the snow. I brushed off the snow that was in his hair and wiped off the liquid which was flowing from his neck with a washcloth. Barbatos had beheaded Rosenberg.</p><p>Thus, our plan was a success. Although there was a variable where Marbas’ second army was defeated by the Imperial Princess, considering the Imperial Princess’ capabilities, if anything, that was an acceptable result. It would be better to consider it a relief that Barbatos had not lost. Additionally, it was thanks to the Imperial Princess winning that I was also able to acquire victory. A tie. It was still a tie……</p><p>For quite a while, the war had reached a state of lull.</p><p>Marbas had to recruit troops once more and Barbatos had to reorganize her army as well. The ones that needed time was not only the Demon Lord Allied Forces&nbsp;but the Human Alliance, which required time to form a new strategy, as well.</p><p>Though it seemed the humans were hoping for the war to end with a short battle, I apologize. This is still much too soon. Please partake in my waltz a little longer. While looking at Rosenberg’s face, I beamed.</p><p>“What are you trying to see even after death? Close your eyes and rest well, margrave.”</p><p>I lowered Rosenberg’s eyelids with my palm. Thus, Rosenberg had finally closed his eyes. I did not know what great cause and what sense of justice this old man was trying to look at&nbsp;in his final moment. It was probably something tedious.</p><p>A captain approached and informed me that Barbatos had called for me. I ordered the captain to hold onto Rosenberg’s head. I intentionally intimidated him.</p><p>“I plan to gift this to General Farnese. Hold onto it well since the general will like it very much. If you were to, perhaps, lose it, then the general would be quite upset at you. At that time, even I will be unable to stop the general.”</p><p>The captain’s face turned pale and he carefully bundled Rosenberg’s head. The way his fingers trembled made it seem like he was handling his own head. I chuckled and made my way towards Barbatos. Within the empty enemy quarters, Barbatos was filing her nails.</p><p>“Oh, you’re here?”</p><p>“I am here to congratulate you for the great victory, your highness–.”</p><p>I uttered while kneeling down. I was the type of person who would even kneel if it was&nbsp;for a joke. Barbatos snorted.</p><p>“All right. It’s quite nice to see that your bullshit is ascending. Follow me.”</p><p>“Are you going to show me something good again? Your good things are lined up for each day, so I’m unsure when I’ll be able to get some proper sleep.”</p><p>Barbatos grinned.</p><p>“Can you just follow me without a word?”</p><p>If you make a fuss, then I’ll pour profanities on you by the bucketload again.</p><p>That was what Barbatos’ gentle smile was suggesting.</p><p>As an individual who believed in common sense and refinement, I followed Barbatos. A prisoner was bound in one of the corners of the military camp. His armor was quite thick. His social standing was most likely a high noble. Barbatos whispered into my ear.</p><p>“That’s the Crown Prince of the Habsburg Empire.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Surely.</p><p>This was something truly great.</p><p>Barbatos slightly bit my earlobe with her front teeth.</p><p>“Dantalian, you won’t swear your loyalty to me. That is a tragedy that I consider to be quite regrettable. However, although you haven’t sworn your loyalty, you are still faithful to me. I don’t plan to accept that without a price.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Oh? And what do you mean by that?”</p><p>“I will give him to you.”</p><p>Barbatos brushed my&nbsp;chest with her hand. It felt as if each of her fingers contained an organic function. So this was what the touch of a hand, that could resurrect the dead&nbsp;from the earth, felt like. That was how I thought. If it was this much, then even&nbsp;I would have gladly stood up immediately if I were a skeleton.</p><p>“You can use that prisoner as you wish.”</p><p>“Barbatos……”</p><p>I gently raised Barbatos’ chin. Barbatos did not refuse my&nbsp;discourteous touch. Our lips drew near.</p><p>“You may know this already, but I despise women with small bodies.”</p><p>“Hm, so?”</p><p>“But you alone, I cannot refuse.”</p><p>“I know, you idiot.”</p><p>We kissed for a long time. It was a kiss that contained gratitude instead of lust. Barbatos, for the reason that I had forced march northwards in order to save her, and myself, for the reason that she did not disregard my standing and presented me with a proper reward. How beautiful is a partner who knows how to be honestly grateful for what they had received, and reward the other party soon after? We were beautiful business partners. I removed my lips and whispered.</p><p>“—Although it feels like the desire to take this to the end right here and now, has piled up.”</p><p>“It’s fine. We already had our fucking fun yesterday. Go and take care of your business.”</p><p>Barbatos gestured towards the Crown Prince with her chin. I nodded my head and approached the Crown Prince of the Empire.</p><p>I wonder if the Crown Prince had rolled around on the ground a bunch since his appearance was dirtier than that of a mongrel. His hair was silver, and yet, due to the mud, it was crudely mixed together with a brown color. With a face full of dirt, the Crown Prince looked up at me. His eyes were sunken like a drunkard who had just woken up from being intoxicated.</p><p>“Who are you……?”</p><p>“Elizabeth’s enemy.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>“Do you not wish to hear my proposal, oh Crown Prince?”</p><p>I grinned smoothly.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Sir older brother.</p><p>I am here to inform you of something nice.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-362.jpg?w=1400\"></p><blockquote><p><strong>Name:</strong>&nbsp;Barbatos</p><p><strong>Race:&nbsp;</strong>Demon Lord</p><p><strong>Job:</strong>&nbsp;Demon Lord(SS)</p><p><strong>Reputation:&nbsp;</strong>The Third Empress</p><p><strong>Leadership: S</strong>&nbsp;rank&nbsp;<strong>Might:</strong>&nbsp;A+ rank&nbsp;<strong>Intelligence:&nbsp;</strong>A-<strong>&nbsp;</strong>rank</p><p><strong>Politics:&nbsp;</strong>C&nbsp;rank&nbsp;<strong>Charm:&nbsp;</strong>A&nbsp;rank&nbsp;<strong>Technique:&nbsp;</strong>C&nbsp;rank</p><p><strong>Title:&nbsp;</strong>1.

      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><h3>Volume 3 - Chapter 5 – Soundless Words</h3><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tMy chastity was in peril.</p><p>\n\tSeverely, at that.</p><p>\n\tThis was not a joke.</p><p>\n\tI could feel the witches drooling as they stared at me.</p><p>\n\tDespite the fact that nothing in particular had occurred, the witches  would invite me to their self-established red-light district while  uttering, ‘Master, something big has happened. Master, something small  has happened…’. If I were to go in there, then those fellows would smoke  opium and viscously leer at me. They were all in the nude. Truly, they  were beast-like fellows. So this was why witches lived while being  mistreated. My vision felt blurred because of this crude temptation.</p><p>\n\t“Have you all gone insane?”</p><p>\n\t“Aha. Is master saying that he wants to do it with all of us at once?”</p><p>\n\t“Why is it that when I pour my words into your ears, you girls hear it through your asses?”</p><p>\n\t“Ara? Would it be better for the lord’s body to do it through our rear holes?”</p><p>\n\t“Are we truly conversing in the same language?”</p><p>\n\t“Just close your eyes once and—owie.”</p><p>\n\tI hit the top of Humbaba’s head with my knuckles.</p><p>\n\t“Listen well, you girls with scanty chests. I do not consider  individuals such as yourselves as potential sex partners. If you are  flat, then you should behave as so and live modestly, and yet, you are  trying to reach out for more. You are not in the position to be taken in  by the world, but rather, you are in the circumstance where you must  take in the world yourselves.”</p><p>\n\t“Ahahah? It is a bit troubling for us, when our master, who was  obediently devoured by Miss Barbatos, brings up the flatness of breasts  as a rebuttal, though?”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tThese misdirected fellows. They really do just dig into another person’s weakness recklessly.</p><p>\n\tWhenever the witches went around outside, they would always wear a  thick layer of clothes. Even during the late winter, where the putrid  smell of water emanated from the surroundings, and the early spring,  where the foul smell of water seeped into one’s intestines, the witches  were unaware of the seasons due to their heavy clothes. Humbaba had told  me that due to the fact that a soulless body was something to be cursed  at, they should not show it to others. Every time the witches would  lower their cone hats deeply on their heads, I recalled the white gloves  which Lapis would always wear. The basis of the witches’ cone hats and  Lapis’ gloves were the same. Birds of a feather were playing together.</p><p>\n\tSeeing how they had walked to my side of all places, it was clear  that they had not gathered here on purpose. This spot was most likely  the place where they had finally arrived at after being chased and  chased away by other people. Although there was an inevitability in  life, and the path of a person going towards a destination was  beautiful, the path of a person being sent to a place of exile, due to  their lives being dependent on a certain inevitability, was not  marvelous. In that place of exile, I believed that I should get rid of  the social status of the lowest class and allow everyone to be  commoners.</p><p>\n\tWithin a single night, I drew a pattern. The symbol was three white  circles on a black background. While showing this to the witches, I  spoke.</p><p>\n\t“From this day forth, this shall be the symbol of Demon Lord  Dantalian. Since you all are my royal guards, it is only natural for you  to go around while bearing my mark on your cloaks.”</p><p>\n\tTo the witches, clothes were a prison that was constantly wrapped  around their bodies. As people who were ousted because they had no  affiliation or home, to the witches, those clothes were their place of  exile. By putting my emblem onto their cloaks, I was releasing them from  their banishment. The witches understood my intention. At first, they  were unable to open their mouths, until eventually, their eyes were  brimming with tears.</p><p>\n\t“M-Maaaaaaster–……”</p><p>\n\t“Shut it. If you don’t want to wear it, then don’t.”</p><p>\n\t“No matter what, we will only strip in front of our master!”</p><p>\n\tWhile weeping, the witches clung onto me. Sheesh. Only sighs could  come out. If possible, I wanted to request for them to not strip while  in front of me, but what could I do in this situation? I patted the  backs of the witches. ……I have to live with these fellows, I see. In the  end, it is my fate to live with them. This damned fate.</p><p>\n\t“Sniffle. So, when will Master take our undergarments off?”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tWake up from your wild dreams, you pieces of gum.</p><p>\n\tExcluding the witches, the only ones allowed to bear my emblem were  solely Lapis and Farnese. While having black mantles draped over each of  our shoulders, we frequently crossed through the Demon Lord Allied  Forces’ military camp. Having seen us from afar, the soldiers would  whisper to one another.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t— The King of Peasants……</p><p>\n\t— The king’s whore and slaves……</p><p>\n\t— Why would such vulgar handmaidens……</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tWe considered the whispers of the soldiers as something more trivial  than the cries of a morning rooster. While squealing ‘kya— kya—’, the  witches hung on my shoulders. It seemed my shoulders were a playground  to them. Even while we were walking, Farnese read a book with one hand,  while furtively grabbing the edge of my clothes with the other. Ah, I  shouted for these troublesome fellows to please get off of me. Lapis  silently followed the us who were like that.</p><p>\n\tSuddenly, it felt as if I had come to this world and made a family.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t♦</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tThe land, which was frozen in winter, had become undone.</p><p>\n\tThe frozen waste melted in patches. The sunlight hugged the thawed  earth more closely. As if trying to accept the rays more vastly, the  snow-covered fields opened their gaps a little bit at a time. Glimpses  of the dirt floor could be seen through the gaps. The shallowly opened  ground of snow appeared like the gills of a white fish. The earth  breathed heavily with the gills and took in more of the sunlight, until  eventually, the snow-covered fields had melted and flowed into a brook.  Although freshwater fishes, bugs, and other livings beings were unable  to live there since the brook water was still cold, the hurried sound of  flowing water called out to other living beings. One day, a reindeer  with antlers came to the brook and put its hooves in the water. After  noticing me, the reindeer hastily jumped out from the stream and ran  away. Spring was in the spot by the brook where the reindeer had  vanished from.</p><p>\n\tWhile withstanding the winter, the Demon Lord Allied Forces increased their bulk.</p><p>\n\tThe rumor that we had burned the Black Mountains and took the head of  the Margrave of Rosenberg surged throughout the demon continent. The  people of the demon race whispered among one another, that maybe, this  time, we can…. This time, the land where the winter is short, we can  drive out the humans and regain our homes…… The demons took up their  spears. Hired soldiers gathered. Volunteer soldiers were formed. Several  Demon Lords, who were once skeptical about war, raised their heavy  bottoms. During the spring where beings came to life, the demons  prepared for war in order to take the lives of the enemy. This year’s  spring will be a brutal season.</p><p>\n\tThroughout the winter, the humans moved busily. Once it had become  certain that the short-term battle would develop into a prolonged war,  every kingdom ruled over by the humans put down a draft order. The  youngsters, who were preparing for the first tilling of the year back in  their farm villages, were gathered onto the battlefield. Occasionally,  whenever the rumors about the human armies would reach us, they were all  rumors about the Demon Lords, who lived near the human territory,  suffering a disastrous tragedy.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t— His Highness, Rank 49th Crocell, had lost his Demon Lord Castle and is seeking asylum in Niflheim……</p><p>\n\t— They say that Rank 70th, Demon Lord Seere, died in battle.</p><p>\n\t— Those rotten human assholes.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tThe sound of voices was rampant. While the Demon Lord Allied Forces  were catching their breath, and the Human Alliance was developing  its breath, the Allied Forces and the Alliance hastily delivered their  voices to one another through envoys.</p><p>\n\tA certain human king had sent a report which claimed that since the  demons were the first to cross over the Black Mountains and invade the  other’s race, this was considered an invasion.</p><p>\n\tSince the one to have plundered and destroyed Dantalian’s Demon Lord  Castle first was the Margrave of Rosenberg, and since Rosenberg is a  human, you humans are the ones to have invaded. We are not the invaders,  we are the victims, was the report that the Demon Lords sent back.</p><p>\n\tIn the first place, you demons are the ones to have spread the Black  Death throughout the world, and since Rosenberg had plundered that  castle with the mere intention to cure his people of that disease, ah,  if we are to distinguish the order of affairs, then are you demons, not  the ones that deserve to die? The human king sent a slightly more harsh  report.</p><p>\n\tFor people who have no proof that we had first spread the plague, and  yet, are insisting on it so fervently, I understand that you humans  have dumb fucking heads on your shoulders, was the response that  Barbatos had written. However, the other Demon Lords adamantly prevented  her from sending that message, and instead, interpreted her words in a  more mild style of writing.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tOnce they had begun to quibble over who had done wrong first, a  countless number of unverifiable criticisms started to pour out without  end. The letters did not have any actual evidence, but instead, provided  support through fancy rhetorics. Throughout the winter, although the  Demon Lord Allied Forces and the Human Alliance quarreled over who was  the initiator, in truth, everyone was already well aware of the fact  that, at this point, who was first did not matter at all. Despite the  fact that everyone had already perceived this, no one showed any signs  of knowing. According to the words conveyed by the envoys, the humans  became the victims and the demons became the victims, making the  universe full of only injured parties. Therefore, everyone most likely  understood that in a world where the heaven and earth had become  victims, that that world could not truly be a world which belonged to  the people who were wronged. It was a self-evident truth. If one were to  go out of their way to speak this self-evident truth out of their  mouth, then people would touch, fumble, and rub that obviousness,  coating it with the dead skin of their hands, until eventually, the  self-evident truth becomes a crude truth covered in dirt, thus the lords  did not utter these words. The first to speak would be the first to  lose.</p><p>\n\tAnd no one desires to lose.</p><p>\n\tNobody.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t♦</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tI hired more mercenaries and increased the mass of my army to 7,000 men.</p><p>\n\tHaving heard the rumor that ‘His Highness Dantalian gives good  wages’, mercenary captains came looking for me on their own two feet.  The captains watched my countenance when before me.</p><p>\n\t“The word that a massive war is going to occur soon, is growing thick……”</p><p>\n\t“The rumors are correct. Will you all follow me to the front as well?”</p><p>\n\t“If anything, if us humble ones were to go to the front line, then would your honor not appear sordid……?”</p><p>\n\t“This is not a war that follows a great cause, it is a battle where  we strike while making use of the enemy’s destitution. How could it be  more sordid than this?”</p><p>\n\t“Would defeating the humans not thus be a great cause?”</p><p>\n\t“Even if that was a great cause, would that be your cause? Even if we  were to get rid of the human empire and establish a millennium, would  that place be your kingdom?”</p><p>\n\t“Your words are immeasurable, your honor. Please be discerning.”</p><p>\n\t“Pay is provided every 10 days within my army. Infantrymen will  receive 1 gold, and cavalrymen will receive 3 gold. As for food, it  would be fine to leave half of your salary with me and solve it with  that, or you can buy from the peddlers that follow behind our unit. As  we do not provide arms separately, manage those yourselves. Since it  operates as so, understand it as so. Do not worry about a great cause,  and only consider the personal profit that you can gain. I shall be the  person to be concerned with the great cause.”</p><p>\n\tThe captains nodded. They had eyes that showed that they understood my words.</p><p>\n\t“Please tell us humble ones the military regulations which we must follow.”</p><p>\n\t“Do not discriminate one’s race or birthplace and only follow rank.”</p><p>\n\tThe captains stood up and bowed their heads to the ground.</p><p>\n\t“We have received your honor’s orders.”</p><p>\n\tDuring the late winter, Farnese trained the newly enlisted hired  soldiers once more. Since there was already a numerous number of  soldiers who were loyal to Farnese, it was not as difficult as it was  previously in order to train the new recruits. 2 soldiers who had beaten  a prostitute to death, 1 soldier who had threatened a merchant, and 4  soldiers who had practiced usury, these soldiers were all caught and  forced to disembowel themselves. Farnese had personally pulled out their  internal organs and boiled some blood soup. Farnese spoke after  spitting out a chunk of an intestine.</p><p>\n\t“Even the insides of these fools are rotten so the taste of the meat  is spoiled. Truly, they were people that one should not be associated  with. Behead them and feed them to the hounds.”</p><p>\n\tEven as winter passed and spring approached, to the soldiers, Farnese  would always remain in their minds as winter, so whenever they saw the  general’s face, their shoulders trembled. Although the ground that was  frozen throughout the winter had thawed, the discipline within the  military remained as cold as a blade.</p><p>\n\tThe soldiers did not get excited by the spring sun, and instead,  trained vigorously. While giving shouts, the soldiers adjusted their  ranks and held out their spears. The soldiers’ sweat fell down onto the  ground where the snow had melted.</p><p>\n\tOnce the fourth month had arrived, the Demon Lord Allied Forces moved  south, the Human Alliance marched north, and as if they had arranged to  do so beforehand, both armies set up their encampment on the opposite  ends of a plain that was located in the center of the human and demon  territories.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 2</p><p> Polles, Bruno Plains</p></h4><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tThe Demon Lord Allied Forces and the Human Alliance sent and received  ultimatums. It was decided that by sending an emissary from both  armies, the two were to discuss whether the two armies will truly go to  war, or if we will go into peace talks. Of course, the chance of a truce  happening was nearly non-existent.</p><p>\n\tThe number of lives that were lost had already reached the thousands.  Like how thunder would resonate when lightning struck, at this point,  going to war was a natural flow of occurrence. Even all of the Demon  Lords—excluding Paimon—were preparing for this war. There was a single  problem.</p><p>\n\tWho would be picked as the envoy.</p><p>\n\t“Why not just pick Dantalian?”</p><p>\n\tBarbatos stood forward here.</p><p>\n\t“He has the most amount of contributions in this war, doesn’t he? His  talking ability isn’t bad either, and since he has the lowest rank,  he’d be perfect to use as an errand boy. We’re sending an envoy  nominally, aren’t we? So there’s no need for us to lose face by sending a  high ranking person, right? Use him as a gofer.”</p><p>\n\tTruthfully, that was a keen insight.</p><p>\n\tIn the exact center of the two armies, a single white tent was set  up. That was the location where the envoys would meet and share a  discussion. Since a lot of brooks flowed through the plains, the sound  of heated stray dogs could be heard mating near the water. There was no  pedigree among stray dogs so a black male dog was tangled together with a  white female dog. I stopped on my way to the tent to observe the mating  of dogs for a while.</p><p>\n\t“Those fellows seem to be better than me at that……”</p><p>\n\tI muttered to myself. According to a long-standing decorum,  emissaries with the task of declaring war were not allowed to have  escorts or attendants with them.</p><p>\n\tOnce I turned around and gazed at the place far behind me, I could  see thousands of flags flapping in the wind. That place appeared like an  island composed of demons. Looking at the opposite side, thousands of  flags were waving there as well, and ten thousands of humans were  gathered in a line, making them appear as grand as an island. Since it  felt as if I had exclusive possession of the ocean between the two  islands, it felt excessively generous.</p><p>\n\tThere was barely anything inside the tent. Two wooden chairs that  were painted white, and a single table which was, of course, also  painted white. Only those three objects were placed here by themselves. I  sat in one of the chairs and silently waited for the humans’ emissary.</p><p>\n\tLike the spring breeze, the envoy of the humans entered the tent.</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tOur eyes met. I moved my head and nodded first. The girl also  returned a light nod. The silver haired girl sat on the chair at the  opposite side of the table. In a single glance, I knew that she was  Elizabeth Atanaxia Evatriae von Habsburg, the Imperial Princess.</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess carried in a parcel. The thing which she  brought out from the package was something that I was not expecting at  all. It was a Go board. In this world, it was a game board that was  sometimes referred to as the Black and White Flags. After taking out a  Go board and a container filled with stone pieces, the Imperial Princess  set them down on top of the table.</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tI gazed blankly at the Imperial Princess.</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess grabbed a handful of the white stones and then  nodded her head towards me. She wanted to determine who was going to go  first and who was going to go after.</p><p>\n\t—Would you look at this?</p><p>\n\tI laughed inside of my head. The intention behind this humorous  gesture was evident. The Imperial Princess was trying to test my  intelligence right now. If I display an ability that is lower than her  expectation, then the Imperial Princess will most likely disregard my  existence and not consider someone like myself as an individual to  negotiate with. Even if I were to browbeat by shouting ‘What foolish  action is this?’, I would gain the same result.</p><p>\n\tHow enjoyable.</p><p>\n\tHow very enjoyable.</p><p>\n\tI picked up a single black stone and placed it on top of the Go  board. It represented an odd number. The Imperial Princess showed the  number of stones that were in her hand. 3. Indeed, it was an odd number.  Since I had guessed correctly on whether the number of stones she had  in her hand was even or odd, I gained the initiative. The fact that the  black stones had the first move while the white stones moved after, was  the same in this world as well. However, there was no komi here. Whoever  takes the black stones and gains the initiative will have an absolute  advantage.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p><em>(TL note: Komi in the game of Go are  points that are added to the score of the player with the white stones  as compensation for playing second.  and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Chang-ho\">Lee Chang-ho</a>. Sanae, also known as Bamboo Grove, does not have a wiki page, but he had won the 2005 national Go championship in S. Korea.)</em></p><p>\n\tAfter the middle point of the match, I often fell into thought. My  breathing became more unmanageable as the mire rose. In order to handle  that unwieldy breathing, I held my breath for a long time and exhaled  deeply. I had to invest more than double, triple the amount of time than  the Imperial Princess had needed in order to make my next move.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t— What’s the matter?</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tWithout even a second of hesitation, the Imperial Princess put down  her next move the instant I put down my stone. She was pressuring me  with vigor. She provoked and ridiculed me.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t— It seems your spirit has abruptly died down. Where have all your  attacks, that you had so self-assertively carried out early on,  disappear to? Have you run out of stratagems? Have you reached the  bottom of your clever schemes? How disappointing. You are a genius with  only a brilliant wit. There are a countless number of geniuses like that  throughout history.</p><p>\n\t— ・・・・・・.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tI did not respond to the provocations.</p><p>\n\tI stooped and stooped again.</p><p>\n\tEven if the Imperial Princess made her move within a second, even if  she deliberately interfered with my territory, I did not concern myself  with any of that and only considered the image of the board. There was  no restriction on time anyway. It was my creed to make use of a  condition that could be used.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t— How insipid.</p><p>\n\t— ・・・・・・.</p><p>\n\t— Try giving a more amusing response. Is this game not becoming  enjoyable for the both of us after such a long time? Come, oh Demon  Lord. Your spirit and my spirit, let us determine which side among the  two is stronger. Would that, too, not also be considered the fun of Go?</p><p>\n\t— ・・・・・・.</p><p>\n\t— Look here.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tI curled up. I merely curled up.</p><p>\n\tIt was fine to curse at me and tell me that I was boring. Laugh at me all you want.</p><p>\n\tThere are no boatmen who would go against raging waves. A boatman  would align the shaking of the waves with the trembling of the bow and  avoid the immediate threat. The reason was simple. Boatmen crossed the  ocean in order to arrive at land, they were not going out to sea in  order to fight against the ocean. In the end, a person with a  destination, a person who was given a direction in life, would not be  flipped over when confronted by provocations. They merely flowed.</p><p>\n\tEventually.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t— ・・・・・・.</p><p>\n\t— ・・・・・・.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tWords had disappeared from both the Imperial Princess and myself.</p><p>\n\tIncitement, ridicule, and even confrontation no longer went back and  forth between us. I endured the time while stooped down, and the  Imperial Princess withstood the time while curled up. We had both  arrived at a distressful time. There was no ingenuity or intuition  there. There was no experience or logic. Since only the surplus of time,  which we had to endure till the very end, remained, we were both pulled  there. That was not the time that flowed, but the time that grabbed  hold and pulled.</p><p>\n\tWhy we had to keep placing down stones.</p><p>\n\tThere was only a single reason.</p><p>\n\tMerely to win.</p><p>\n\tOnce the fight on the board, that was once a competition for victory  and also a type of conversation, had reached its final moment, only  the match to determine the winner remained. We had lost the meaning  behind all the silent conversations we had shared up till now. No, we  were unable to even remember it properly now. Only the Go board placed  in front of us existed in our sight.</p><p>\n\tThat was the end.</p><p>\n\tIt was an end game with no glory or disturbance.</p><p>\n\tIt was a concluding move that moved according to the end sequence that was determined.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t— <em>Tack</em>.</p><p>\n\t— <em>Tuck</em>.</p><p>\n\t— <em>Tack</em>.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess stopped her hand.</p><p>\n\tThe 252nd turn.</p><p>\n\tHer slender fingers, which were holding onto white stones, drifted in  mid-air. As if the time somewhere on her fingers were caught in a net,  it remained in place. A long time flowed by. The Imperial Princess  nodded her head, and then, moved her hand towards the Go pieces  container.</p><p><em>Clack clack clack.</em></p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess dropped three to four stones on top of the board at once.</p><p>\n\tBulgye(不計)</p><p><em>(TL note: N<em><em>o</em><em>count</em><em>of</em><em>the</em><em>points</em><em>due to</em><em>a one</em>–<em>sided</em><em>game. The Go equivalent of saying ‘Good game’.)</em></em></em></p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tIt was a declaration that represented one’s surrender.</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tI picked up two black stones and placed it on top of the board.</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tOnce I did so, the Imperial Princess took two white stones and placed  it down. I had asked her a question. If I had won by 2 points. The  Imperial Princess then confirmed that I did indeed win by a 2 point  difference. I carefully nodded my head. So I won by 2 points, huh?</p><p>\n\tAfter putting away all of the stones, we reenacted the war from the  very beginning. We were reviewing the moves we had made. Although it was  obvious, the Imperial Princess and I clearly remembered every single  move we had made from start to finish. There was no hindrance in  reenacting everything.</p><p>\n\t“Why did you put it down like this here?” [Elizabeth]</p><p>\n\t“Since you kept clinging to me, I twisted it around in order to confuse you.” [Dantalian]</p><p>\n\t“Aah, so you really were trying to do that. I was dubious since it  was such a random move. I panicked a bit because I assumed you were  perhaps aiming for a sharp resolve.” [Elizabeth]</p><p>\n\t“How about you? Why did you spread out your pieces here like this?  From what I can see, would conquering the bottom right not be the wiser  decision……?” [Dantalian]</p><p>\n\t“Is it not too obvious? If I were to place a stone down there, then the shape would have flowed like this……” [Elizabeth]</p><p>\n\t“Aah. You were worried that all of your pieces at the bottom would disappear.” [Dantalian]</p><p>\n\t“That is so. If possible, I wanted to leave that spot alone.” [Elizabeth]</p><p>\n\t“Wait. If I were to play a piece here, then what would have happened?” [Dantalian]</p><p>\n\t“Mm. Would that not be a move with a bad pulse?” [Elizabeth]</p><p>\n\t“A bad pulse? Wait a moment. If I cut it here then……” [Dantalian]</p><p>\n\t“I told you it really is a bad move. Look carefully, the stone that has difficulty surviving in the middle……” [Elizabeth]</p><p>\n\tAt around the time our review had ended.</p><p>\n\tI looked up towards the sky by chance and noticed that it was pitch  black. It was bizarre. It was something where we could not tell when the  sun had set. Once I had perceived our surroundings, I realized that we  were looking down at the Go board while solely relying on the moonlight.  I drew my brows together and gazed at the Imperial Princess. As  expected, the Imperial Princess was neatly knitting her brows. The other  party was a stranger, and yet, they also felt familiar. It felt as if  we had died and come to life again.</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tWe both stood from our chairs. Just like we did when we had first  arrived, we left without sharing a single word as well. The very fact  that we had discussed so many things while reviewing was questionable.</p><p>\n\tThere was an uproar the moment I returned to the Demon Lord Allied  Forces’ encampment. They were curious as to what sort of negotiation,  that required me to be stuck in the tent from dawn to dusk, had taken  place. I could not give any sort of response to the Demon Lords who were  asking whether the war was determined, or if a truce agreement was  achieved. Barbatos, with a face that looked like she was staring at the  world’s weirdest person, asked me.</p><p>\n\t“What happened? What kind of talk did you share over there?”</p><p>\n\t“……No, nothing was settled yet. I’ll tell you once things are decided.”</p><p>\n\t“When will it be determined then? Tomorrow?”</p><p>\n\tI tilted my head.</p><p>\n\t“Probably the day after tomorrow? Around then.”</p><p>\n\t“I mean, it’s good that you’re earnestly carrying out the meetings,  but why do you need to negotiate for three days in a row in a situation  where there’s no other option but war?”</p><p>\n\t“I’m not sure yet, so don’t ask.”</p><p>\n\tThe Demon Lords appeared pent-up. Regardless, since I truly did not  know, I was unable to give a proper response. In conclusion, it was  officially decided that the negotiation will continue tomorrow and the  day after.</p><p>\n\tI avoided the questions from the other Demon Lords and returned to my  quarters. As usual, Lapis was educating Farnese in our quarters.  Farnese was learning how to speak while reading out loud the lines  written on a piece of paper. She had a good head on her shoulders so she  was able to memorize the lines themselves with ease, but her tone while  giving a speech and other things related to that were not perfect yet.  Well, everything was most likely not perfect in the eyes of Lapis. I  made them stop their practice for a moment and spoke.</p><p>\n\t“Farnese, do you perhaps know how to play Black and White Flags?”</p><p>\n\t“Do you mean Go? Though this young lady may have read a lot of  records of Go matches, this young lady has never played it herself. Most  of the time, this young lady just enjoyed reading the records by  herself.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“Mm. And you, Lapis?”</p><p>\n\t“This one does not have any experience as well. Is something the matter?”</p><p>\n\t“No, it’s nothing. You can continue practicing.”</p><p>\n\tI sat in the corner of the room and continuously stared up at the  empty space. The match that I had played until earlier kept drifting  around in my head. It was not something that was driven by the mere  shape of stones. On that board, a certain atmosphere, or something  similar to mood, clearly took shape there. However, no matter how much I  tried to recall that form, nothing could be precisely grasped.</p><p>\n\tOnce in awhile, I could hear the sound of Lapis scolding Farnese. I  closed my eyes and looked back at the air of the Go board. However, the  only thing that appeared in my mind were the slender fingers of the  Imperial Princess Elizabeth. Although it somehow felt as if there was a  key point there, it was difficult to believe that there was that kind of  secret hidden point behind those fingers. ……Really, there are quite the  strange occasions in the world. I muttered to myself.</p><p>\n\tTomorrow, the Imperial Princess will most likely gain the initiative while I go second.</p><p>\n\tI will probably lose.</p><p>\n\tThat was the last thought that crossed my mind before I fell asleep.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 2</p><p> Polles, Bruno Plains</p></h4><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tAs soon as the first rooster cried out at dawn, I walked out to the plains.</p><p>\n\tAt the tent, the Imperial Princess had already arrived and was seated on the chair.</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tWe greeted each other lightly this time as well, however, different  to the first day where it had ended after giving each other slight nods,  we both lowered our heads properly this time. We did not do so with the  particular intention of showing the other party respect. It was just  that courtesy naturally came out on its own. Once I raised my head, even  the Imperial Princess was furrowing her brow as if something was  strange.</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tAbruptly, the Imperial Princess stood up and grabbed my wrist. She  turned my hand back and forth and examined it, but the more she looked  at it, the more her brow were furrowed. I did not stop the Imperial  Princess, since due to her eccentricity, I was also able to carefully  observe the Imperial Princess’ fingers.</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess’ hand was rough. My mind remained smooth  because of that roughness. I understood the fact that the roughness of a  hand and the smoothness of a mind were proportional to one another. It  was a surprising truth. Even though I was already formerly aware of this  truth, it felt as if I had just now first learned of it. While our right hands were being grabbed at and were grabbing the other, we gazed at each other.</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tIndeed, there was something peculiar. Although I did not know what was weird, something was weird anyway.</p><p>\n\tSimilar to yesterday, a Go board was set on top of the table. I  obviously took the white stones while the Imperial Princess naturally  took the black.</p><p>\n\tThe result was my defeat.</p><p>\n\tOn the 232nd turn, I admitted my Bulgye defeat. No matter how much I  calculated it, I was at a disadvantage by 1 point. I muttered bluntly.</p><p>\n\t“Is it a 1 point difference?”</p><p>\n\t“It is a 1 point difference, I see.”</p><p>\n\t“Hm.”</p><p>\n\t“Do you want to review?”</p><p>\n\t“Although I am eager to do so……”</p><p>\n\tI looked up towards the sky. We had clearly started the match at  dawn, but somewhere along the line, the sky was glowing with the setting  sun. More time was consumed in today’s match compared to yesterday. Be  it the Imperial Princess or myself, we did not tease or ridicule one  another even once, and instead, handled our stones earnestly from start  to finish. It was a state of affairs where excellent skill was sought  out in a fair match. Furthermore, since the Imperial Princess’ ethos was  antique to me, I was unfamiliar with it, and since my ethos was uncanny  to the Imperial Princess, it was foreign to her. Since my fair move  became a trick to her, and her excellent skill became a bad move to me,  it became increasingly difficult. Thus, it was inevitable that a lot of  time was consumed.</p><p>\n\t“……At this rate, it seems negotiations will be fruitless today as  well. It is troubling since the other Demon Lords will grill me about  what I had possibly done that would require this much time.”</p><p>\n\t“It is the same on this side as well. Though I had come out at dawn  with the intention to leisurely go into negotiations after having  finished a match of Black and White Flag, I did not expect that it would  take this much time……”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“Ah, I apologize. I must have come out a bit late.”</p><p>\n\t“No, there is no reason to apologize. I arrived only moments before  you had, after all. The amount of time I had waited most likely does not  even reach 20 minutes.”</p><p>\n\t“Hm.”</p><p>\n\t“Mm……”</p><p>\n\tWe looked back and forth between the Go board and the other person’s  face. We did not express it vocally, but we were sharing the same  thought. It felt like it would be proper etiquette to be the first  person to speak since I was the one to be defeated today. I opened my  mouth.</p><p>\n\t“Imperial Princess, you do not have any intention to go into a truce, is that not so?”</p><p>\n\t“Ah, I have none. Whatsoever.”</p><p>\n\tAn immediate response.</p><p>\n\tWe both nodded our heads at the same time.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t“Then I guess the agreement is over.”</p><p>\n\t“Good. The treaty is over.”</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tWith that, the negotiations had come to an end.</p><p>\n\tThere was not even an inch of dissatisfaction from either the  Imperial Princess or myself. A truce negotiation that had ended within 5  seconds after it had started, would this, perhaps, not be the very  first time in history that this had ever occurred? Whatever it was, it  did not matter. There was something more important to us right now.</p><p>\n\t“Let’s review the match.”</p><p>\n\t“Let’s.”</p><p>\n\tWe revised the match until just before midnight. Part-way through, a  small mock-game would unfold whenever the question ‘what would have  happened if I had placed it like this here?’, would arise. We tried to  figure out how to continue the groundwork of our curiosity in order to  keep up the effects of a cheonwon until the mid-portion of the game.  Sadly, far from the answer, a method that reached the vicinity of a  solution did not appear.</p><p>\n\tToday as well, the Demon Lords waited for me with wakeful eyes. To  the questions about what had happened during today’s negotiation, I  responded.</p><p>\n\t“4 hours from now, the human emissary and I have arranged to meet  once again at early dawn. Before the day ends tomorrow, without fail, I  plan to determine whether we will break down the negotiation or come to  an agreement.”</p><p>\n\tDespite the fact that I had carried out the negotiations since dawn  today, the other Demon Lords were surprised by my statement that I was  going to continue the rest of the conference at 4am tomorrow. Among  them, a few of the Demon Lords had even complimented me because I was  behaving in a truly rare to be seen earnest and sincere fashion.</p><p>\n\tOf course, the negotiation was already over. We both did not have  even the slightest intention to end the war. There was a need for us to  carry out our final game simply because our current match record was in a  state of a 1:1 draw. No matter what happens, this was a match that must  absolutely take place.</p><p>\n\tAfraid that I may possibly be defeated due to a lack of sleep, I went  to sleep the moment I entered my quarters. Although Farnese had latched  onto me and requested for me to please do something about Lapis, I  ignored it. Handle your education yourself.</p><p>\n\tThis lord has the most important match of his life placed before him right now, child. Do not disturb him.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 3</p><p> Polles, Bruno Plains</p></h4><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tI dozed off for a 3-hour nap. Since I had no reason to wait an hour, I  walked out to the plain. On this day, it has been 1 year since I had  fallen into this world.</p><p>\n\tThe plains were drenched in the foul smell of water. Whether the  morning dew was trying to make prior preparation to form, or if a bout  of a sudden shower was making a declaration of war, the drowsiness of my  eyelids gently spread the air that was drenched in moisture. That  transmission felt pleasurable. 10 minutes after I had entered the tent,  the Imperial Princess arrived.</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tWe greeted one another. We lowered our heads more than we did yesterday.</p><p>\n\tThe final match had begun. I took the initiative with the black  stones while the Imperial Princess played second with the white stones.  Continuing from yesterday and the day before that, the most magnificent  match unfolded today.</p><p>\n\tLike the first match, we provoked each other without hesitation.  However, we did not mock one another. Even if she rushed in immediately,  my arrangement was not at risk since my base still remained there. In  the locations that were dangerous, the black and white stones were  evenly mingled together because there was a risk towards me. Although  the fight of turns was intense enough to make my head feel dull, since  there was no countdown, I was able to regain my composure through my  mind. ……Aha, a fight without time restraints was this splendid, was it? A  critical beauty can be contemplated as just beauty, I see.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tA drizzle fell during dawn.</p><p>\n\tRain fell to the ground while containing the scent of the clouds.  People say that if a person wished to be fragrant, then they must be  broken down many times. The raindrops made sure to break apart and  emanate a scent. While being drenched by the sound of the rain being  broken apart and the foul fragrance emanating from the rain water, we  continued our game of Go. Since our clothes were more burdensome than  the rain, we took off a couple of layers. Like how my body was already  dripping wet with water, I was now being drenched more comfortably.</p><p>\n\tMany raindrops fell on top of the Go board as well. The rain that  fell on the black stones splattered, while the rain that fell on the  white stones smoothly flowed down the line of the stone. Water pooled on  top of the board. Be it the black stones or the white stones, their  bodies were at least half engulfed in the water. Rather than us having  placed them there ourselves, it appeared as if they were there by  chance, making their placement closer to a coincidence than a necessity.  At times, I placed down my stones without any thought, making it feel  as if the rain was thinking in my stead, and the stones were fathoming  everything in my place. If one were to look at it again, then that was  an excellent move that contained prudency. However, if someone were to  ask if I had put down an excellent move because I wanted to, then I  could only tilt my head. To me, that felt like a fair move.</p><p>\n\tThe streak of rain fell onto the plain as well. As the rain roughly  struck the ground all around us, it made our surroundings tranquil. In  order to prevent other miscellaneous things from approaching us, the  sound of rain pounded down those miscellaneous sounds. Though I was  drenched, I believed that the rain curved away from us and fell at the  edge of the plains. I did not feel as if the demon army and the human  army, which resided on this and that side of the plains, were islands,  but instead, believed that this spot we were currently in was the  island. The game board was another island within that island. Therefore,  the two of us who were surrounding that island were tranquil like the  ocean.</p><p><img data-attachment-id=\"36181\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2016/10/14/dungeon-defense-volume-3-chapter-5/%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-3-page-399/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-399.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"819,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-3-page-399\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-399.jpg?w=205\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-399.jpg?w=700\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-399.jpg?w=700\" alt=\"%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-3-page-399\"></p><p>\n\tBefore I knew it, I was not fighting in order to win, but I was fighting in order to not make a mistake.</p><p>\n\tThis day must not be stained by an error. Albeit it would be a  different case if I were to make a mistake where I was unable to realize  the opponent’s well-thought out play, I absolutely could not forgive a  mistake that occurred due to being lazy and insincere. That would be a  shameful and sorry thing to do.</p><p>\n\tSince I had a lot of time to think and fathom, my stone placement  speed was slow. The Imperial Princess was like that as well. We were  lethargic. The slow bodies were wet by rain so they were profound. The  instant the rain had stopped falling from the sky, we held our breaths  for a moment. The water had cleared from the board. The match was  decided.</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\t313 turns.</p><p>\n\tBulgye.</p><p>\n\t1 point difference.</p><p>\n\tBlack’s victory.</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess Elizabeth muttered.</p><p>\n\t“……It seems I have basked in all the beauty I could bask in during my lifetime.”</p><p>\n\t“Indeed.”</p><p>\n\t“Demon Lord, could you die here together with me?”</p><p>\n\tI slowly nodded my head.</p><p>\n\t“I am fine with that, but is there a need to die right this instant?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“What point is there to live any longer when the light will fade after today? If it is now, then I can lightly depart.”</p><p>\n\t“I promise you that the number of occurrences more pleasant than this will increase from now on.”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tElizabeth placed her hand on her chin and went into deep thought.</p><p>\n\t“I understand. I shall believe in your words, Demon Lord, and live  longer. Even if having hope and having that hope then betrayed is what  is referred to as life, I do hope that at least you will not betray my  expectations, Demon Lord.”</p><p>\n\t“I will do my best. ……Ah, let us not review today’s Go match.”</p><p>\n\t“Mm. I too wish to just leave it like this.”</p><p>\n\tI lowered my head deeply.</p><p>\n\t“I am Dantalian. I am in your care.”</p><p>\n\t“I am Elizabeth. I will also be in your care.”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess bowed her head as well.</p><p>\n\tWe had introduced ourselves on the third day after having first met one another.</p><p>\n\tI spoke.</p><p>\n\t“Imperial Princess, in the hometown where I had once resided, 6 to 7  points are deducted from the black stones that go first. If this were my  hometown, then this would be your win.”</p><p>\n\t“How could one judge these matches with a foreign rule? Please withdraw your words. I wish to accept a lost as a lost.”</p><p>\n\t“How could I throw away my home and fool my mind when my heart  constantly remains at home despite my body being here? To me, this is  the same as having lost to you, Imperial Princess. This is not something  that can be convinced otherwise.”</p><p>\n\t“Then we have both lost.”</p><p>\n\t“We have both won.”</p><p>\n\tWe nodded our heads. For a long time, we stared at the board that had  rainwater pooled on top of it. Although the rain that must fall had all  fallen, there was still time left for it to flow. Several raindrops  formed a streamlet and gently flowed. I spoke.</p><p>\n\t“It should be fine to hold a conversation now. Please consider this  as a secret meeting held between the two of us, Imperial Princess. If by  any chance, would it be fine to confirm whether you possess a tool  similar to that of a Memory Play artifact? If that is not a discourtesy,  that is……”</p><p>\n\t“Ah, of course.”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess stood up and took off a single layer of  clothing at a time. I received her clothes and felt her inner and outer  pockets. There was nothing. There were raindrops that had formed on the  Imperial Princess’ pure white naked body. I returned all of her clothes.</p><p>\n\t“Thank you.”</p><p>\n\t“Would it be fine if I could check as well……?”</p><p>\n\t“Naturally.”</p><p>\n\tI took off all of my clothes and pushed it towards the Imperial  Princess. As I had done, the Imperial Princess searched even the corners  of my clothes as well. She nodded and returned my clothes.</p><p>\n\t“Excuse me for the inconvenience.”</p><p>\n\t“Nonsense.”</p><p>\n\tWe put back on our soaking clothes. While sitting face to face on our  chairs, we were finally able to get to the main point. The first person  to open their mouth was the Imperial Princess.</p><p>\n\t“It was your mistake for having spared the Margrave of Rosenberg and  sending him to me, Demon Lord. Although it seems like you were hoping  for Rosenberg and myself to have an internal strife over military power,  the margrave is too old to pull that off.”</p><p>\n\t“I also consider that as something regrettable.”</p><p>\n\tIt was true. I thought that the Margrave of Rosenberg would resist  against the Imperial Princess a little bit more. I did not expect that  he would obediently become a meatshield and die on the battlefield. In  the original timeline, he was an individual who had put the Empire in  turmoil because he had nearly started a revolt against the Imperial  Princess.</p><p>\n\t“How did you cajole the margrave into doing it?”</p><p>\n\t“He meekly obeyed after I put my body against his a single time. He was a silly old man.”</p><p>\n\tI chuckled. She was a girl who knew how to enjoy a joke.</p><p>\n\t“I see the Imperial Princess is good with jokes.”</p><p>\n\t“Is that so? ……That is a compliment that I am hearing for the first time since I was born.”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess made a thin smile. It was a smile that befitted her. I rested my body comfortably on my chair and spoke.</p><p>\n\t“You criticized me that I had made a mistake, but Princess, that is  the same for you as well. It seems you had sent the Crown Prince along  with the margrave. How unfortunate. If he had died during the dog fight,  then you would have become the sole successor to the throne. Though you  would have probably put the responsibility of the Crown Prince’s death  on the margrave……”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess let out a sigh.</p><p>\n\t“Was my brother captured?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“We caught him alive. The Crown Prince is currently my prisoner.”</p><p>\n\t“……Never in his life has that blood relative of mine been helpful to  me. I had tried to poison and assassinate him before, but he is  strangely quick-witted so he was able to survive to this day. At the  very least, I gave him the opportunity to die honorably, and yet, to be  caught as a prisoner there……”</p><p>\n\t“I have shared private conversations with the Crown Prince often.  Thanks to that, I have come to know about most of your past. It is quite  inspirational.”</p><p>\n\tI smoothly raised the corners of my mouth.</p><p>\n\t“Apparently, you had murdered two of your sisters and two of your brothers.”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess’ sighs became deeper.</p><p>\n\t“……I see my brother truly has told you everything. Oh Demon Lord, did  my brother tell you the whole truth behind the reason why I had killed  my own flesh and blood?”</p><p>\n\t“Yes.”</p><p>\n\tBy coaxing the Crown Prince, I had raked in everything that could  possibly work as a weakness against Elizabeth. The family history that  the Crown Prince and Imperial Princess was involved with was rather  ridiculous. Among what I had gathered, although there were several facts  that I had already obtained through the game, the amount of information  that was not revealed in the game or were only alluded and not properly  revealed, was exceptional. I started to talk.</p><p>\n\t“Originally, your family of the same blood consisted of two other  sisters and three brothers…… Though there was no insufficiency in  numbers, in regards to sustaining the Imperial family, after having  faced mysterious deaths after deaths, only the Imperial Princess and  Crown Prince, only the two of you remained.”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\t“The rumors about these tragic deaths are abundant. The Crown Prince  had murdered them, no, they had a secret feud that resulted in  mutual destruction. They were sacrificed because of a plot by several  nobles……”</p><p>\n\tBut they were all wrong.</p><p>\n\tAll of them.</p><p>\n\tI stared straight at the Imperial Princess.</p><p>\n\t“According to what the Crown Prince had told me, he claimed that, in  truth, you, the Imperial Princess, had murdered all of your siblings. Is  that true?”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess nodded.</p><p>\n\t“That is true. I killed them all.”</p><p>\n\t“Though there was a 6-year-old little brother among them……”</p><p>\n\t“That is so. Is there a problem?”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tI let out a bitter laugh.</p><p>\n\t“Despite that, do you not feel some sadness, Imperial Princess?”</p><p>\n\t“Of course I feel sorrow. However, what problem is there in sorrow?  As one should feel sorrow for something that is sad, one must also take  the lives of the things which must be killed. That is the way I live. By  any chance, do you live differently, Demon Lord?”</p><p>\n\tWithout any change, the Imperial Princess’ face remained cold. Her  face stayed the same ever since she had first entered the tent and even  while she was playing Go. It did not feel as if she was particularly  managing her facial expressions. The Imperial Princess was most likely  sincerely asking me ‘if there was a problem with that?’. I scratched my  head and replied.</p><p>\n\t“No. I roughly live like that as well.”</p><p>\n\t“I somehow knew that would be the case. You live quite pitifully……”</p><p>\n\t“Is that something you should be saying to me……?”</p><p>\n\tThe wind finally blew after quite a while. It was a wind  that contained moisture. The white fabric heaved like curtains and  momentarily blocked our vision of one another. Once the breeze had  settled down, we could see the other’s face again. The Imperial Princess  spoke.</p><p>\n\t“I do not know if my brother had told you or not, but my brother had  made my first and second sisters into his lovers in secret. They were  committing incest.”</p><p>\n\t“I have heard.”</p><p>\n\t“Whether they committed an incestuous relationship or not, I did not  care. However, since I was going to have to compete against my brother  for the throne later on, when that happens, I figured it would be a bit  bothersome and cumbersome if my sisters were to support him. Thus, when  my brother and sisters were exhausted after having shared the same bed, I  used that opportunity to kill them.”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\t“My brother was unable to show any defiance. My sisters were murdered  on his bed while they were naked. If this incident were to be known  elsewhere, then my brother would be suspected immediately. Did he have  intercourse with his blood siblings? Did he murder them after having  slept with them……? As a result, my brother was desperate to hide my  sisters’ dead bodies. My brother is a pathetic man.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“Mm. A clean approach.”</p><p>\n\t“That is what I think as well.”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess let out another sigh.</p><p>\n\t“I dealt with the rest of my brothers whenever the opportunity  presented itself. However, I made sure to leave no evidence behind in  any of those incidents. Only my brother had the sole belief that it was  me. Albeit, he was a man who did not have the confidence to even reveal  that belief to others…… Demon Lord, you were able to successfully coax  that brother of mine.”</p><p>\n\t“I am uncertain of the exact details, but his animosity towards you  is quite impressive. Once I swore that I would become the enemy of the  Imperial Princess, his mouth opened on its own. Well, it is thanks to  that animosity that I was able to obtain so much information without  having to go through any particular trouble.”</p><p>\n\t“Did you acquire evidence?”</p><p>\n\tI shrugged my shoulders.</p><p>\n\tNone at all.</p><p>\n\tI only had the testimony of the alcoholic Crown Prince.</p><p>\n\tAfter examining my face, the Imperial Princess closed her eyes.</p><p>\n\t“That is a relief. A close call, if you may. If you, perhaps, also  had evidence, then I would have been done in by you without being able  to budge an inch, Demon Lord. Far from unifying the continent, to think  that I was nearly taken out before I could ascend to being the  empress……”</p><p>\n\t“But I have the testimony of the Crown Prince. It would become quite  bothersome if the Crown Prince were to go around speaking of your crimes  publically. Your honor and reputation would receive a great blow……”</p><p>\n\t“Who would believe the testimony of a Crown Prince who was captured  by the army of a Demon Lord? At most, people would overlook it as him  having been either threatened or brainwashed by the Demon Lords.  Furthermore, that man may be my brother, but he does not possess even  the slightest bit of trust from the nobles. That will be a vain attempt,  Dantalian.”</p><p>\n\t“Will it truly be in vain?”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\t“Do you wish to test it out, Elizabeth?”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess tapped her forehead with her finger. No matter  how incompetent the Crown Prince was, he was still the crown prince.  Even without evidence, he could still raise unrest within the imperial  society with his firm beliefs alone.</p><p>\n\tAs the Imperial Princess had pointed out, that disturbance could end up being small.</p><p>\n\tOr perhaps, that unrest could become incredibly substantial.</p><p>\n\tThere was no such thing as 100% certainty.</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess slowly moved her lips.</p><p>\n\t“What are your conditions?”</p><p>\n\t“My castle was destroyed because of the Margrave of Rosenberg.  Albeit, I may be living without a home by wandering around here and  there, even that has become quite tiresome now. Assist me in procuring a  new home. ”</p><p>\n\t“……Are you saying that you want me to present you the margrave’s territory?”</p><p>\n\t“Mm. Since the person to have taken away my home is the margrave,  then would it not be appropriate for me to take the margrave’s home?”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tTap tap tap.</p><p>\n\tThe tapping of the Imperial Princess’ finger became stronger.</p><p>\n\tThe sound of horses could be heard on the plains. Once the horses on  one side of the plains started to neigh, the horses in the encampment on  the opposite side of the field let out a low neigh as well. The sound  of neighing lightly crossed over the tent and died down between the two  of us. Until the sound of horses had become silent, the Imperial  Princess and I were staring at one another.</p><p>\n\t“Fine. I accept.”</p><p>\n\t“Then I will momentarily return to my camp.”</p><p>\n\t“I shall as well.”</p><p>\n\tWe returned to the tent after 30 minutes. I had brought the Crown  Prince with me while the Imperial Princess had brought a certain man who  was in his prime and a young boy, both of whom were bound together by a  rope. They both had a fabric wrapped around their faces. She had dealt  with them as so in order to prevent others from knowing who they were. I  yielded the Crown Prince to the Imperial Princess first.</p><p>\n\t“Here. It’s your brother.”</p><p>\n\t“It is quite touching to be able to reunite with my family.”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess talked about her emotions flatly. She took the  rag off of the Crown Prince’s face. While letting out a gasp, the Crown  Prince quickly looked around at his surroundings.</p><p>\n\t“W-Where is this? ……Elizabeth? What are you?”</p><p>\n\t“I had sent you to die, but it seems you have returned alive, brother.”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess breathed lightly.</p><p>\n\t“You have made things quite troublesome for me. This is most likely  the greatest achievement you have ever achieved throughout your entire  life, brother.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“What……? You bitch, how could a devil like you be well off……”</p><p>\n\tThe Crown Prince was unable to continue his words. The Imperial  Princess had swung her blade and slit the Crown Prince’s throat in a  straight line. While gurgling blood, the Crown Prince fell to the floor.</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess knelt down and skinned her brother’s face.  Before the Crown Prince could fully meet his end and was still  breathing, he slowly died as his face was severed off. The Imperial  Princess shoved the skin of her brother’s face into her pocket.</p><p>\n\t“Thank you, Demon Lord. Seeing as his features did not change despite  having died, he is most certainly my brother and not a fake stand-in.”</p><p>\n\t“Promises are precious, are they not?”</p><p>\n\t“Mm. Promises are important.”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess gestured towards the two human captives that she had brought.</p><p>\n\t“This man here, who is in his prime, is the Margrave of Rosenberg’s  only son. After I gained the suspicion that the margrave was trying to  start a conspiracy, I continued to keep this man captive.”</p><p>\n\t“And who is the small boy?”</p><p>\n\t“The margrave’s grandson. It seems he is this man’s illegitimate  child, so he is not of a formal descent. I went through some trouble in  order to catch him. This is the remaining lineage that the margrave has  left in this world.”</p><p>\n\tI tore off the cloth that was wrapped around the two captives’ faces.  They both had their mouths shut tight by a piece of fabric. Uh, uuh,  uub…! The two hostages opened their eyes wide and looked around. I  closely examined the report that Lapis had researched, thus, the  descriptions of the features of both the margrave’s son and grandson.  The captives before me were real.</p><p>\n\t“They are correct.”</p><p>\n\t“Do you wish for me to skin their faces in your stead, Demon Lord?”</p><p>\n\t“That is fine. Though it may be my first time tearing the faces off  of people, there is always a first experience for everything……”</p><p>\n\t“A splendid demeanor.”</p><p>\n\t“Then……”</p><p>\n\tI dealt with the son and grandson while following the knife movement  that the Imperial Princess had shown me a second ago. The Imperial  Princess lowered her back next to me and pointed out the mistakes that I  would make while cutting.</p><p>\n\t“Wait a second, Demon Lord. You shouldn’t leave the blade idle there like that.”</p><p>\n\t“But does this not make it appear tidier?”</p><p>\n\t“It may appear as so at the moment, but when you look at the finished  product later…… It can’t be helped. I cannot watch while standing idle.  Pass me the knife.”</p><p>\n\t“Tsk tsk. This is also a type of fixation……”</p><p>\n\t“How noisy. If we are going to do it, then it would be best to do it efficiently.”</p><p>\n\t“We are going to burn everything anyway……”</p><p>\n\tWe argued with one another while tossing about. We had ruined the  corpses to the point where one could no longer recognize their  identities.</p><p>\n\tWhile lifting up the bucket of oil that we had both brought with us,  we poured it all over the corpses and the tent. We then exited the tent  and set it on fire. It was an old custom to burn down the tent on the  occasion that the negotiations had broken down. As the black smoke rose  up, it notified both armies that the war was going to start from now on.  The white tent was completely engulfed in flames instantly. While  watching the flames, I spoke.</p><p>\n\t“It is a bit of a shame that the Go board has to burn……”</p><p>\n\t“Is it not magnificent for it to burn as it is? The record of the  match is in our heads anyway, so we can look back at it whenever we  desire.”</p><p>\n\t“Mm.”</p><p>\n\tI shared a handshake with the Imperial Princess.</p><p>\n\t“In one way or another, that was a good negotiation, Imperial Princess.”</p><p>\n\t“I am also satisfied. By the way, Demon Lord. I will give you half of  the world, so will you not become my subordinate? If the two of us were  to combine our strengths, then we could hasten the unity of the  continent by a decade.”</p><p>\n\t“I agree.”</p><p>\n\tI held the Imperial Princess’ rough hand tightly.</p><p>\n\t“However, Imperial Princess. Have you heard about this kind of story  before? In the past, there was a conqueror who was the second greatest  in the world. The conqueror had everything in the world. One day, the  conqueror visited a sage. This sage, as an elder who was aloof with  material needs, had nothing that could be considered as his property.  The conqueror asked. ‘Tell me what you desire. I will gift you  anything.’ At that moment, the sage pointed over the conqueror’s  shoulder and replied. ‘Get out of my way. You are blocking the sunlight  that is coming towards me.’ The conqueror lamented for a long time and  left that spot. According to the legend, the conqueror said this. If I  was not born as a conqueror, then I would have wished to have been born  as that sage……”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess raised her brows as if she was in awe.</p><p>\n\t“That is an interesting tale. ……No, that is truly an interesting  tale. It is a story that lets out a fragrance the more you dwell on it. I  am moved.”</p><p>\n\t“I am delighted that it was pleasant to your ears. Imperial Princess, do you know what the moral of that story is?”</p><p>\n\t“What is it?”</p><p>\n\tI smiled.</p><p>\n\t“It is very simple. Either obtain everything or obtain nothing at  all. Elizabeth, for you to request of me to come under someone’s  command, that is quite the excessive joke. You should be the one to  become my vassal instead. I shall present you half of the world.”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess gazed at my face blankly.</p><p>\n\t“……I see there is no common ground between you and I.”</p><p>\n\t“I sadly believe that is so as well. However, is it not also our  methodology to feel sorrow for the things that must be grieved and carry  out the things that must be accomplished?”</p><p>\n\t“Those are indeed the right words, Dantalian. I truly do wish to make  you submit to me a day sooner. I will pray that the day I make you lick  my feet approaches sooner.”</p><p>\n\t“Oh dear, Elizabeth. You can rest assured that you will lose. I am  Dantalian. Dantalian, I say. If you shine like the sun, then I will  always be hiding in the dark moon. You will one day run out of vitality  and collapse, however, I am unable to do so. I will never reveal myself,  after all”</p><p>\n\t“I will more than gladly allow that arrogance of yours. You have the  freedom of being prideful. But that is before someone plunders that  freedom. Please bask in that freedom as much as you can now.”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tWe released our grip.</p><p>\n\tPutting the burning tent behind us, we headed towards the locations  where we both respectively had to return to. That white island had  drifted on top of the ocean for 3 days. It will most likely never rise  back up once it had sunk.</p><p>\n\t“Ah, right. Dantalian.”</p><p>\n\tA voice came from behind. The moment I turned around, something flew  towards me. I received the item that was flying towards me with both  hands without thinking. It was an old pocket watch. Confused, I looked  out into the distance and the Imperial Princess shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>\n\t“I thought about it carefully. No matter how much of an incompetent  piece of trash my brother may be, the crown prince is still the crown  prince. The crown prince of the Empire. There would be no grace if I  were to exchange that figure with merely the son and grandson of the  margrave. Think of that as my small goodwill. It would also be fine to  consider that as the wager of our match.”</p><p>\n\t“What are you talking about?”</p><p>\n\t“Habsburg grants their faith a single time.”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess smiled.</p><p>\n\t“—And Habsburg has just now given you their one faith.”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess turned around and walk towards the other side  of the plains. For a long period of time, I watched her leave. I put the  pocket watch into my coat and returned to the Demon Lord Allied Forces  campsite.</p><p>\n\tThe Demon Lords were lined up at the gate of the military camp and  were waiting for my arrival. They had already seen the smoke that rose  up from the burning tent. Starting from the previous autumn and  continuing past the winter, that smoke had now finally arrived at this  location. In other words, that was the final beacon of fire. The smoke  had started from the mountain range, flowed to the governor’s palace of  Niflheim, crossed over the demon territory, pushed through the gates of  the Black and White Fortresses, and finally, it blazed in this Plains of  Bruno. That was so. It was war. Anyone would know that war was  proclaimed. Despite that, I, while looking around at the Demon Lords,  shouted as the thunder that must crash after the light of a lightning  had flared.</p><p><strong>“A rupture!”</strong></p><p>\n\tThe Demon Lords raised their fists into the air. They all cried out in a single voice.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p><strong>— A war!</strong></p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tIn this moment, there were no war advocates or advocates of peace.  Only the animals that had jumped into the battlefield were present  there. War! War! A war……! From the Demon Lords to the captains, from the  captains to the soldiers, the cries of beasts transmitted to everyone.  The roar of the massive army of a hundred thousand soldiers struck the  sky. Since the sky had let down rain, it was now the earth’s turn to  shed blood.</p><p>\n\tCome, oh sweet war.</p><p>\n\tNobody is turning you away.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 3</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p> Polles, Bruno Plains</p></h4><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tThere was a type of ceremony in a war where tens of thousands and  tens of thousands faced one another. It was the proclamation of war. In  this world, since people considered spoken words as something more  sacred than written text, the declaration of war must flow out of the  mouth of a person in a massive war that was supposed to be the most  divine of battles.</p><p>\n\tThe instant the speaker finishes their speech on the proclamation of  war in front of thousands, the Demon Lord Allied Forces will no longer  be just the Allied Forces and will instead be referred to as the Army of  the Crescent Alliance. The demons revered the moon and night. By  pulling in the nature that they respected and admired the most, they put  their names into a strong alliance.</p><p>\n\tThe moment the speech ends, the humans will no longer be something  like the Human Alliance, but instead, be referred to as the Soldiers of  the Cross. The cross was a symbol that represented the light of the sun.  As the humans revered the sun, even if the night were to immediately  arrive today, it clarified that all night was a dusk that called upon  the morning.</p><p>\n\tThe war between the Crescent Alliance and the Crusaders was now no  longer a trivial brawl of the land. That was the order of nature and the  providence of the sky. It was the history of the Gods. 1,500 years  since this continent had opened and civilization was established, the  gods had allowed the blood of slaughter and the screams of carnage to  occur under their holy names 7 times.</p><p>\n\tEmpire calendar, 1506th year, 4th month, and 3rd day. Once more, the  gods had ordered the 8th book of history to be recorded with the ink of  crimson blood.</p><p>\n\tAs the emissary who had undertaken the final negotiation, I was  nominated to be the speaker of the proclamation of war by default. It  was a great honor. At the very least, it seems the other Demon Lords  hoped that I would think of this as a great honor. I was not unaware of  the fact that they had put everything onto me because they did not  desire to have the blame shifted to them by stepping forward.</p><p>\n\tBe it the history of gods or something else, showing off was showing  off, so us people of the earth could only live while eating salt.</p><p>\n\tOh, Gods, you are truly mighty. Who could possibly abhor conveying  the holy meaning of slaughter? Furthermore, since the Gods worshiped by  the Crescent Alliance and the Crusaders are the same, would this not all  be a domestic quarrel? I shall accept the glorious volition of domestic  quarrel……</p><p>\n\tIt is fine to say that I am blasphemous. I am a blasphemous person.</p><p>\n\tIt is fine to say that I am atrocious. I am an atrocious person.</p><p>\n\tI desired for the world to become more blasphemous and for people to  become atrocious. I planned to acquire my wishes from the mire where the  blasphemous people and the atrocious people shed their blood.</p><p>\n\tPure and simple, my goal is to save the world that will be destroyed.  I was nearly petrified by this paradox several times. Even now, I was  barely able to endure the desire to be startled.</p><p>\n\tWho could deny this goal?</p><p>\n\tIf altogether, the arson, the carnage, and the tragedy that I had  caused, played the role of saving the world in the end, then dear lord,  who could refuse me?</p><p>\n\tHow desperate would the voices that deny me be, and how pitiful would  they sound? Those voices will without a doubt start with ‘but… however…  despite that…’.</p><p>\n\tThe fact that they have to start their words with a conjunction. This  was their misfortune. They had to fold, bend, and assemble their words.  On the other hand, I uttered like a person of power.</p><p>\n\t‘Saving the world is correct.’</p><p>\n\tHow straightforward is this?</p><p>\n\tI wish to live like this once.</p><p>\n\tWhile swinging around my authority as I please and gracefully holding  a glass of wine in my hand, I wanted to try saying ‘Calm down, friends,  I am merely trying to save the world’. I wanted to justly enjoy my  authority to no end. My wish was being accomplished.</p><p>\n\tWith my vassals in tow, I led them to the top of a rocky hill. The  other Demon Lords were in my path to the top of the hill. The Demon  Lords nimbly made way for me as I approached. From this point on, I was  the officiant who had received the words of the gods. Nobody could speak  to me rashly. Even the Demon Lords, who were the commanding generals of  an army corps, Barbatos, Paimon, and Marbas, were silent.</p><p>\n\tFinally, my vassals and I had arrived on top of the boulder.</p><p>\n\tThat place was the plains.</p><p>\n\tA smooth field spread out before us. I wonder if it was due to the  fact that rain had fallen during the dawn since a wet fog was stagnated  over the plains. Past the wet fog, glimpses of waving flags could be  seen. Each time the wind blew, thousands of flags and banners roared  out.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“……”</p><p>\n\tIt felt as if no sound could be heard.</p><p>\n\tA perfect silence.</p><p>\n\tAs there was no high or low class in the world enveloped by mist,  there were no abusive nobles or witches who received scorn, no soldiers  that slaughtered or subjects who were slaughtered, and instead,  everything that existed was buried in fog.</p><p>\n\tThe witches gazed towards me. They were notifying me that the  preparation for the declaration of war speech was complete. Now the  orator’s voice will resonate throughout the entire plains with the sound  enhancement spell.</p><p>\n\tHumbaba spread out her fingers on both hands. Since the ring finger  of her left hand was gone, Humbaba counted down not from 10, but from 9.  The countdown had begun.</p><p>\n\t9, 8, 7・・・・・・.</p><p>\n\tThe person to carry out the speech here will become the public enemy of the continent.</p><p>\n\tThe human soldiers will curse them as they die and the demon soldiers  will blame them as they fall. That was the role of the blind person in  charge. The reason why I, the lowest ranking Demon Lord, was given the  authority to give this so-called glorious and holy speech was because  everyone else did not want to take responsibility for the war. Paimon,  of course, and even Barbatos was like that as well.</p><p>\n\t6, 5, 4・・・・・・.</p><p>\n\tIn addition, I was indeed like that as well.</p><p>\n\tI did not like pointlessly taking the role of responsibility. Is that  not the perfect position to be treated well until one’s uses have run  out? Referentially, a noble man must avoid dangerous places on their  own.</p><p>\n\tTherefore.</p><p>\n\t“Farnese.”</p><p>\n\t“Aah.”</p><p>\n\tI more than gladly conceded my divine authority to my subordinate.</p><p>\n\tTo the girl who avidly relishes in having their name remain in history.</p><p>\n\tI more than gladly passed onto her the honor of becoming an unprecedented celebrity and adorn anarchy.</p><p>\n\t“Have a safe trip.”</p><p>\n\tFarnese nodded lightly and stepped forward. Though I could hear the  sound of the Demon Lords, who were watching us, letting out shocked  noises, I ignored them. The sound enhancement spell had already been  invoked. There was nothing obscene or disorderly enough to stop the  speech that had already begun.</p><p>\n\tHumbaba had wickedly omitted the entirety of the last 3 seconds and  activated the spell. The witches and I stepped back and grinned. Aah, we  were truly jeering happily.</p><p>\n\tEven the education on the method of speech that Lapis had kept  drilling into Farnese’s head was all for this moment. Now, the most  sacred territory of authority will be sullied by not the Demon Lords or  the demons, but by a human. The holiest ground of authority will be  smeared by a lowly illegitimate child. As Lapis had done in the  governor’s palace of Niflheim, it was now Farnese’s turn to sully  things.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tNow then, my daughter.</p><p>\n\tSpread poison throughout the world.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t—Oh, humankind, listen.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tAll of history until now has been the history of class strife.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><hr><p>\n\tTL Note: I must say, I still don’t understand Go that well despite  having translated this chapter. Well, that’s beside the point. I am  translating again! I’m feeling good(?) now, so I should be able to pump  out the rest of the volume before the end of this month. Though, I may  actually finish a lot sooner than that.</p><p>\n\tI’m saying this again, but please read Dungeon Defense slowly! This isn’t something that you can enjoy if you rush through it!</p><p>\n\tI recall someone mentioning that they didn’t entirely like how the  novel took some Asian culture things into the story, but this chapter is  one of the reasons why I disagree with that. None of the moves and  scenes described here can be done with something like chess. I’d rather  have the author use things that they are more knowledgeable about than  some half-assed scene that has no impact.</p><p>\n\tOh right, Go was basically the equivalent of Starcraft in Korea before Starcraft was released.</p>"

I sympathize with you all. What are you?</p><p>Ο</p><p>—Please spare us.</p><p>—If not this humble one, then at least this one’s daughter.</p><p>—I will work as a hound for the rest of my life, so please forgive me.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Fire-fallow villagers. You were all weak and powerless so you prostrated yourselves like dogs and begged. Barbatos ridiculed and played around with the you, who were like that. When she had taken your lives, she did not bother to ask you all for your names. That’s because&nbsp;your names did not have enough value to be remembered even after death. Because you were pitiful, I had furtively sneaked in irrelevant remarks while interpreting Barbatos’ words.</p><p>“What is your name?”</p><p>“Do you have any last words you&nbsp;wish&nbsp;to leave behind?”</p><p>“Prepare yourselves for death.”</p><p>The moment I did so, you came to the realization that you were going to meet your ends soon and cried. Until your demises, none of your words reached Barbatos. Since you all did not have power, your words had no meaning. ‘Spare me, do not kill me.’ even these words, that are considered the most desperate in the world, had no meaning. I see that you all do not have authority. I feel pity for you all. What are you?</p><p>Ο</p><p>— For your honor’s mistress to be an outcast, general to be a human, and royal bodyguards to be witches, your honor’s good faith impales the sky. Indeed, it’s befitting of the King of Peasants.</p><p>— You must be very fortunate to be so popular with women, your honor! Please teach the people how to bed lowly harlots and spread the information throughout the world.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Witches. You had silently received the snow and mud that were tossed at us. The soldiers had scorned and jeered at you, who were like that. It is most likely impossible for a person to not even feel the slightest bit of guilt when throwing dirt at another person, but perhaps, you were not people to them. But how could you all not be people? They say that you all do not possess souls, but if that is so, who does? I see that your&nbsp;bare bodies have been torn, cracked, struck, and stomped upon, sullying your bodies with cuts and bruises. Because you were pitiable, I gave you my mantles.</p><p>“I vow, that I, Dantalian, shall never return thy advice with silence, and shall never return thy suggestions with scorn. If thou art to sweat and bleed for my behalf, then I shall repay thee the exact weight for every drop of sweat and blood.”</p><p>The moment I did so, you understood that I had acknowledged you all as people and thus cried. Was this a world where people shed tears when they are acknowledged as people? ‘I am a person, I too am a person.’, were even these words, which are considered as one of the most earnest desires in the world, not allowed to you all? I see that you all do not have authority. I feel sorry for you all. What are you?</p><p>Ο</p><p>— I’m sorry, Father. I won’t do it again……I’m sorry……</p><p>— My father to this young lady…… this young lady, repeatedly……</p><p>Ο</p><p>Slave. Your life was ruined because of a mistake that was not yours. People ignored and disregarded the you, who was like that. In order to make you into an existence that did not exist in the world, they had imprisoned and confined you. I see that since you are ignored and confined wherever you go, your body is your place of exile and the world is your prison. I understand that even if you were to find a lover and have a child, that child will certainly be the child of a slave, so your body itself is a damned curse. I have heard about the sad servants who had severed their reproductive organs on their own in order to not pass down their curse. To you all, there was no answer other than death. However, how could death be the answer? Because you were sad, I whispered to you.</p><p>“You are no longer the victim. You are the assailant. You are no longer a part of the weak who are offended, but a part of the strong who offend. If someone tries to take your life, then kill them before they can get to you first. It is simple. If that someone is your father, then kill your father, and if that someone is God, then kill God as well. All you have to do is take all their lives”</p><p>The moment I did so, you led the cavalry and slaughtered the enemy. Once I had given you authority, you were thus no longer a person who was killed, but a person who brought upon death. ‘The person who tries to kill me, I have no other choice but to kill them first.’, did you live while being unable to utter even once these words that are the most ardent in the world? In the end, I see that people will not kill you if you have authority. I feel sorrow for you all. What are you?</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Fire-fallow villagers, witches, slaves.</p><p>Are you all pitiful, sorry, and sad people? Is that solely it? Is that why someone has to sympathize, pat your heads, and take care of you? Will you all eternally remain as kind, soft, and pure individuals if someone were to do so? Are those your true colors?</p><p>Ο</p><p><em>If we go now, when will we return</em></p><p><em>If we go now, when will we return</em></p><p><em>Our villages are burning and our sons are burning</em></p><p><em>Aha, if we go now, then when will we return……</em></p><p>Ο</p><p>However, were your cruelly laughing faces, which you displayed while plundering and committing arson, not also your true selves? Was immediately slaughtering the other peasants the moment you received authority, not your bare faces?</p><p>Ah, you are all not merely kind, soft, and pure eunuchs. You are the same as I. The same kind. I am a man of influence, and you all are nothing more than people who have yet to obtain authority. That is it. ‘We are also the same! We also want authority!’ even these words, that are the most obvious outcry in the world, must be allowed to be said by you all.</p><p>Despite that, fellows like Rosenberg simply considered you all as poor subjects. Would that be better? Do you all wish to live naively for the rest of your lives? Do you not have desires? Do you not have any cravings for authority? Do you plan to be obedient for all eternity like castrated pets? I regard you all as my equal! Therefore, since I do not consider you all as mere kind, soft, and pure-hearted subjects, since I will not simply sympathize and stroke your heads, I will not take care of you all.</p><p>Rosenberg believed that he stood much higher than his subjects. Thus, that was why he had tried to pull his subjects into his arms, and tried to save his people till the bitter end. Since the words which he was caught by were old-fashioned, that old man was most likely in agony because of that threadbareness.</p><p>Peasants, I will take your lives if needed, and if needed, you all can take my life as well. That is what I mean by considering you all as my equal.</p><p>Is there a difference between the burnt corpses hanging on that black wall and the miserable lives that are attached to the rampart like clams?</p><p>If there is a separation in life and death, then there is only authority.</p><p>You all have the rights to desire authority and live for it.</p><p>The sight of you all struggling, bleeding, killing, and being killed for authority is beautiful to me.</p><p>If he is to see you roar out as you are drenched in the blood of your enemy, then all Demon Lord Dantalian can do is shed a tear.</p><p>What are you?</p><p>You all have been nothing until now.</p><p>What must you all become from now on?</p><p>Everything.</p><p>Stab your spears into the people who have stolen your words, deprived you of your souls, and castrated you of your&nbsp;aspirations. Take back everything that those people had stolen from you. By doing so, one by one, you all will become wonderful as people.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—&nbsp;Spare me, do not kill me!</p><p>—&nbsp;I am a person, I too am a person.</p><p>—&nbsp;The person who tries to kill me, I have no other choice but to kill them first……</p><p>—&nbsp;We are also the same! We also want authority……</p><p>Ο</p><p>However, listen. Your words are too messy.</p><p>What is this? Are you talking about this? These are not words. These are the grumbles of a newborn infant. It is a noise that is also static. I see, though I consider you all as my compatriots, you do not possess a language.</p><p>Before you all can take the lives of others, you must first learn words. I have gone through deep contemplations in order to determine what sort of words should be placed down upon you all. Since your language must be a language of struggle, a language of carnage, and over all else, a language of authority.</p><p>All of you who offered your taxes to the people in power, obediently faced invading enemies and died, and only knew how to resent&nbsp;others because nobody would help you, will forever be dead from now on. When the Black Death swept over the continent, your fates have died alongside you.</p><p>With the mere intention to congratulate you all on your long deaths and new births, I give you this royal message.</p><p>Listen, oh, peasants. In the stead of the already dead Gods, a Demon Lord shall bestow upon you a language.</p><p>Scream with your respective mugs and respective traps.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Oh, humankind, listen</p><p>All of history until now has been the history of&nbsp;class strife.</p><p>There are two wars in the world.</p><p>One is the war between humans and demons.</p><p>However, the fact that there is a more tenacious war than that,</p><p>a war that has been ongoing for the past 1,500 years without a single moment of rest, at that.</p><p>Do you, mankind, know what that war is?</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ο</p><p>That is the devastating war which lasts forever.</p><p>Compared to that, the war between the humans and demons is foolish.</p><p>The humans and demons have conflicted against one another merely 8 times since the beginning of the world, however, that massive war has continued on every year, every month, every day, and every second.</p><p>Free citizens and slaves,</p><p>aristocrats and commoners,</p><p>barons and serfs,</p><p>the suppressors and the oppressed.</p><p>Are you all still unable to hear</p><p>the hoarse voice of devastating war that is being fought by these people?</p><p>Ο</p><p>This is the eternal war, only this is the true war.</p><p>Even if the demons were to disappear from the continent</p><p>you will all still be at war.</p><p>As 1,500 years has already flown by, and even if another 1,500 years were to flow by once more,</p><p>the war of class, the war of authority will continue unchanged.</p><p>Ο</p><p>To all of the sons and daughters being oppressed in the world, listen.</p><p>500 years ago, Demon Lords advanced onto the continent for the first time in history.</p><p>On that day, the rulers of kingdoms lamented about the conservation of mankind.</p><p>Your ancestors went to war while risking their lives in order to protect mankind.</p><p>Despite that, even after the war was over, serfs were still serfs and</p><p>the subjects were still subjects.</p><p>400 years ago, the Demon Lords descended onto the continent for the second time.</p><p>Your ancestors fought against the demons once more and came out victorious.</p><p>How surprising. How impressive.</p><p>You are all truly the shield which protects humankind.</p><p>Despite that, even after the war was over, peasants were still peasants and subjects were still subjects.</p><p>Ο</p><p>If you all were not there, then the continent</p><p>would have already fallen into the hands of the Demon Lords.</p><p>For the past hundreds of years, you all were the guardians of humankind,</p><p>and are the owners who have carried the weight of civilization for centuries.</p><p>300 years later, on this day, the Demon Lords have arrived on the continent.</p><p>However, what is this? Oh, owners of the continent? You are all commoners who are still serfs, peasants, and slaves.</p><p>You are the weakest among the weak who are dying off to a plague!</p><p>What have you all died for until now?</p><p>Ο</p><p>You all have certainly defended the continent.</p><p>That continent was a land that remained the same before a&nbsp;war had occurred and even after it had broken out.</p><p>You are still in poverty.</p><p>You are so poor that your poverty feels like it will be eternal.</p><p>Even if your mothers catch the Black Death and die in your beds,</p><p>you all are impoverished to the point where you are unable to buy even a single herb.</p><p>You have all lived while making sacrifices.</p><p>What were those sacrifices for?</p><p>You have all lived while going to war.</p><p>What was that war for?</p><p>Ο</p><p>For the past 500 years, have you all scattered tens of thousands of lives and tens of thousands of tears in order to protect your poverty? Did you obey those rulers and people in power because all of you desired to forever be impoverished? For this scene of your mothers groaning, your fathers being whipped by aristocrats, and your siblings collapsing while plowing the fields, in order to protect this scenery, this continent,</p><p>Have you all died until now?</p><p>Ο</p><p>That is not so.</p><p>Humankind, the truth is like this.</p><p>The&nbsp;mankind that the monarch of kingdoms, the emperor of empires, and the aristocrats of domains cry out for is not you.</p><p>The continent that those nobles want to defend is not your land.</p><p>Those authority figures have lived to this day not wanting to protect the lives of the people and the land of the people, but solely for the purpose of defending their own lives and their own fortunes.</p><p>Oh, humankind, listen.</p><p>Ο</p><p>The things that your ancestors had protected while&nbsp;shedding blood</p><p>was not something which belonged to the people, but something that belonged to others,</p><p>solely the possession of those false nobles.</p><p>Ah, the war is over but you all are still in poverty!</p><p>That is obvious! Since all of you had helped those people in power!</p><p>In general, what type of fellows are those rulers? Even if monsters swarm to your villages, they do not dispatch their troops in order to protect you.</p><p>They have thrown you away, they have thrown you, humans, away. Despite that, the instant Demon Lords start to approach, those nobles enforced you all to sacrifice yourselves this time as well.</p><p>For humankind!</p><p>Even though the Black Death circulated in your villages, those people in power did not provide you all with the cure. They had completely thrown you, you humans, away.</p><p>Nonetheless, once the Demon Lords&nbsp;drew near</p><p>those aristocrats are enforcing you all to sacrifice yourselves.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>For mankind!</p><p>Now the mankind that those nobles are referring to has become clear.</p><p>The humankind that they are talking about is the humans called aristocrats.</p><p>The continent that they are referring to is solely the land which those nobles possess.</p><p>What were those humans&nbsp;for?</p><p>They were solely the humans for the suppressors.</p><p>What was this war for?</p><p>It was solely a war to preserve that suppression.</p><p>Ο</p><p>What were those 1,500 years of history for?</p><p>Continuing on from the past thousand and five hundred years, you have all died and continued to die in order to foolishly pass on your eternal poverty to your sons and daughters!</p><p>Oh, mankind, not the mankind that those nobles say with honeyed words,</p><p>but you, serfs, peasants, slaves, and true subjects.</p><p>You, the owners of this land.</p><p>You, the subjects who must all become owners.</p><p>Is something not off? Are you all truly the peasants?</p><p>As all of you are the proprietor of this land,</p><p>and rather, those aristocrats&nbsp;the parasites</p><p>latching onto your skins and veins,</p><p>are they not the true peasants who suck on your sweat and blood?</p><p>Since they are the peasants, then would it not be appropriate for you all to become the lords?</p><p>Why are those nobles embezzling the grains of wheat and corn that you have harvested?</p><p>Why do they not protect their subjects when they are attacked by monsters, despite claiming to be the owner?</p><p>In the end, why do they collect taxes even though everyone is starving to death?</p><p>Ο</p><p>That is because they are not the proprietors.</p><p>Oh, humankind, they are not the owners but they are thieves.</p><p>They are the bandits who steal everything that you must bask in.</p><p>The nobles only deprive.

I do not expect myself to become tame towards you all, and I do not want to only be protected by you. The vassals I love the most are the ones who know how to betray others. Therefore, I can only love Lapis Lazuli. I can guarantee that Lapis will one day gift to me a poisoned chalice. I cannot wait for that day to arrive.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>On the other hand, Humbaba’s betrayal was disappointing. As one must not be caught if they had betrayed another, they should also, at the very least, reap all the benefits they are able to obtain when their betrayal is revealed. Even if I were to assume that Humbaba allowed herself to be caught by me on purpose, to have lost money! How could they have only received half the price of betrayal!? That is why they are lost. I have no other choice but to cater for these lost children. What can I do? They are shameful fellows.</p><p>……Imperial Princess Elizabeth is the same as me.</p><p>We both know the fact that words are nothing more than tools. However, we also know that words are useful tools of authority.</p><p>The Imperial Princess is a girl who will rip off the entire face of a human who goes around with a bunch of makeup. She enforces everyone to go around while displaying their naked faces. Indeed, there is no other technician who is as outstanding as the Imperial Princess in peeling the skin off of faces.</p><p>But, Elizabeth.</p><p>You have only lived as the Imperial Princess who was born in the Empire.</p><p>You have no other choice but to forever live as the Imperial Princess of the Empire.</p><p>That is your depth and limit. You will forever go around while leading a group of nobles.</p><p>But I am different.</p><p>After having fallen into this world, I have constantly contemplated about how I was going to defeat you. I am an obscure rank 71st Demon Lord and you are a person of influence in the most powerful Empire. I was low and you were high. I was inept and you were adept.</p><p>In order to drag you down from that high position and shove you into the mud, I formulated a grand plan.</p><p>The first was Lapis Lazuli.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—&nbsp;I, Lapis Lazuli, born from a succubus and raised in the back alleys of towns and cities, a person to have worked as a third-degree merchant for the Keuncuska Firm for 10 years, shall forget her past and live solely for the purpose of being Demon Lord Dantalian’s subordinate. This heart. This head. This soul&nbsp;shall forever be in the possession of your highness.</p><p>Ο</p><p>I had brought this cold-hearted half-breed, who was treated as an outcast, to my side on purpose and made her into my fiancee. It was not simply because she was competent. It was because she was useful to my grand stratagem. I got engaged with a peasant.</p><div></div><p>Next was Laura De Farnese.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Laura De Farnese. As the third daughter of the Duchy of Parma and the rightful heir of Piacenza, on this night, continental calendar 1505th year, 9th month, and 10th day, with all the Gods here as witness, I hereby vow: If your lordship orders for this young lady to be your sword, then she shall become your sword. If ordered to be your&nbsp;head, then she shall become your&nbsp;head. If ordered to be your legs, then she shall become your legs. This young lady’s will, this young lady’s knowledge, and this young lady’s efforts shall eternally be devoted to your lordship.</p><p>Ο</p><p>I had brought this illegitimate child, who was born as the child of a slave and isolated from the world, as my retainer and made her into my acting general. She, too, was useful to my grand plan. I appointed a peasant.</p><p>Finally, the witches.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—&nbsp;Us Berbere Sisters, born without a home, raised in the back alleys of towns and villages, and individuals who have spent our lives as mercenaries for decades and centuries,&nbsp;wish to now forget our pasts and find value in our lives as solely Demon Lord Dantalian’s followers. Our hearts, our heads, our souls will forever be a part of your highness’ possessions. Therefore, your highness, please take care of our lost hearts, heads, and souls.</p><p>Ο</p><p>I accepted these witches, who were scorned into a place of oblivion because of their lack of souls, as my subordinates and appointed them as my royal guards. The witches were indeed incredibly beneficial to my great stratagem. I embraced peasants.</p><p>Oh, Elizabeth.</p><p>This is my groundwork.</p><p>With these children, who were enshrouded in darkness by the flames of the world and had their minds burned, I shall overturn your nobles and commoners. I shall burn everything. As the pure white and detached Imperial Princess, remain at the summit till the very end. And then, be choked by the smoke that we raise and be burned to death.</p><p>From now on, the peasants of the lowest class shall be my black stones.</p><p>Aristocrats? You can take all of those. Take everything that are like white stones yourself. I will have the initiative anyway.</p><p>Oh, peasants, my groundwork&nbsp;who are also my dead stones, what are you? What must you become?</p><p>Each stone that is placed on the board is a stone that will kill the enemy and will be killed by the enemy. If your lives are going to break apart like stones, then there is a need for you to become as firm as a stone first. Whenever you are struck and you are striking down others, a hard noise must resonate.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I see that your sound is still too soft. I am hearing all of your noises. Speak once more. I shall grasp and raise back up the words that were buried in the background.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—&nbsp;Spare me, do not kill me!</p><p>—&nbsp;The person who tries to kill me, I have no other choice but to kill them first……</p><p>Ο</p><p>Your voices are limp. They are weak. Do not remain with simple cries and add the form of words. Threaten the ones that try to take your lives. Show off that even you have the slightest amount of strength. By doing so, instead of throwing up cries, you will be able to spit out words.</p><p>“We are&nbsp;<strong>one</strong>. We shall unite by countering against our enemy. If a person of influence hangs the life of one, then we shall become a thousand and retaliate. Let us see if you can handle the weapons of a thousand.”</p><p>Oh, peasants, what are you? Will you escape from being pitiful, sorry, and sad people? I have been turning my ear towards your noise. Speak once more.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—&nbsp;I am a person, I too am a person.</p><p>—&nbsp;We are also the same! We also want authority……</p><p>Ο</p><p>A magnificent voice. Let us add a form to that. Since words are authority, and as people fall into ruin if they use their authority thoughtlessly, people will collapse if they use words carelessly as well. In order to not allow others from approaching, build a fortress and ramparts with words.</p><p>“All humans are equal. The right to murder the person who tries to murder me is equally in my and our possession. If authority is the ability to kill others, then we as well shall become people in power.”</p><p>Good. That is a rampart with a well-structured foundation. An impregnable formation. Continue to remain here.</p><p>If you all are to make a fortress, then that will thus be my fortress.</p><p>If you all are to wave flags, then my army will advance there.</p><p>If you all are to establish a world, then my world will be there as well.</p><p>Rightfully desire all you want. I shall tell you how.</p><p>Rightfully become something that is feared. I shall provide you all with weapons.</p><p>I sympathize with you all. I shall be your desires, your fears, and your deaths.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>I am Dantalian.</p><p>The king of you peasants.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p><img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-3-page-453.jpg?w=700\"></p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><h4>▯Blood Relative Killer, Imperial Princess of the Empire,&nbsp;Elizabeth von Habsburg</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day&nbsp;3</p><p>Polles, Bruno Plains, Human Alliance</p><p>Ο</p><p>—Oh, humankind, listen.</p><p>Ο</p><p>A girl’s voice echoed vastly throughout the plains.</p><p>It was an elegant and refined voice. It was a voice that reminded one of winter because the emotions contained in the tone were thin. It was a voice that was firmly trained and stood upright in the center. It was most likely taught to her by a good teacher. Just hearing a person, who had properly learned how to speak, gave a beautiful form.</p><p>With a pair of binoculars in hand, I observed the girl standing on top of the boulder. Is that girl Laura De Farnese……? I muttered out loud. It was the slave that Dantalian had gone all the way to the Kingdom of Sardinia in order to airlift. Certainly, that was an individual with many uses.</p><p>Ο</p><p>—&nbsp;All of history until now has been the history of&nbsp;class strife.</p><p>Ο</p><p>What is she talking about?</p><p>I gazed through the binoculars. The girl had no emotions on her face. She was a girl who possessed the beauty of snow and frost. Surely, with that appearance, it was a given that the wild rumor, that Dantalian had brought in a human harlot because he was captivated by her looks, would arise. As her speech continued, the nobles around me started to whisper among one another.</p><p>“The start of the declaration of war speech is quite eccentric.”</p><p>“No matter what they rattle on about, the unity of us humans is unbreakable……”</p><p>Each noble had a pair of binoculars placed against their eyes. The content of the speech was completely different to what they had predicted. Certainly, the captains and soldiers started to stir. No one has ever heard or learned about the massive war that came close to the holy war of the Crusaders.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— This is the eternal war.</p><p>Ο</p><p>However.</p><p>As the girl’s words continued to firmly strike the air.</p><p>As the girl’s voice continued to flutter and echo throughout the sky.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— To all the people in the world who are being oppressed, listen!</p><p>Ο</p><p>The nobles’ faces contorted with rage and the faces of the soldiers twisted into astonishment. There were no bounds to the aggressive words that came out of that girl’s pretty mouth. They were not words of refusal, nor were they words of persuasion. They were words that pounded and broke apart the ground that was hiding something underneath its frozen earth, until finally, pulling it out.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ο</p><p>— What were those sacrifices for? What were those battles for!?</p><p>Ο</p><p>The girl shouted out without reserve. Her words were easily terrifying. As they were words that cleaved and caused division, they were words that divided and generated incitement&nbsp;and were also words that weaved and manipulated. The girl slashed at the humans with words that were sharper than blades.</p><p>“……”</p><p>Aah.</p><p>Aaah!</p><p>I realized the other party’s intention. The girl’s intention, the intention of Dantalian who was hiding behind that girl and spreading his venom. That Dantalian, that Demon Lord does not intend to fight against the humans. He is luring the humans into fighting each other!</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Humankind, listen.&nbsp;What must you all do in order to protect what is yours? What must you do in order to take back what is yours from those thieves!?</p><p>Ο</p><p>The soldiers were already wavering. That girl’s voice was spitting out a&nbsp;poison. Infected by that poison, the soldiers looked around at the faces of the other soldiers. The nobles were unable to regain their composure and shouted.</p><p>“T-That! That, that, what, my word!”</p><p>“I already knew well about the shortcomings of those demons, but to say such thoughtless words!”</p><p>What foolish people.</p><p>They were unable to even smell the scent of poison that was approaching us from all sides. I felt as if I was suffocating. Only the thought of preventing that speech went through my mind.&nbsp;……That’s right. We must stop those words of division no matter what. I had to block it in order to prevent the irrevocable chaos and calamity that will engulf the continent. I quickly stood up from my chair and rushed towards the mages.</p><p>“Immediately activate the spell for our speech.”</p><p>“Your highness?”</p><p>“Did you not hear me? I’m ordering you to activate the spell.”</p><p>The mages looked at me with troubled faces. An old man with wrinkles on his forehead lowered his head.</p><p>“My apologies, your highness. The preparations are not yet complete.”</p><p>“Not complete?”</p><p>“Since we were notified by your highness that our forces will be giving our speech second, we had prepared to activate the spell exactly at that time.”</p><p>“It will be fine with just sound enhancement magic. I know how to speak the language of demons. Right now……”</p><p>“Your highness, although sound enhancement magic is not an incredibly difficult technique, advance work is essential in order to raise the volume to the point where it can resonate throughout the entire plains. Please generously understand that magic is not universal.”</p><p>“If that is so,&nbsp;then how long will it take before preparations are complete?”</p><p>“At the fastest, it will take 10 minutes.”</p><p>“10 minutes……?”</p><p>A cold sweat went down my neck.</p><p>It has been such a long time since I had last felt a cold sweat. Was it perhaps the time my brother had dragged me to his room and forced me to watch him have intercourse with my sisters? Was it the first time since then? Just like that day, which had ruined my life, a cold sweat deeply slid down my neckline. I could feel the drop of sweat slide down the line of my neck and down the outline of my chest.</p><p>“……”</p><p>I slowly turned my head and examined the soldiers once more. They were all serfs, slaves, and peasants. Unrest spread across each and every one of their faces. Ah, 10 minutes would be too late. If 10 minutes were to pass, then it will forever be too late……</p><p>Am I only able to listen silently?</p><p>Like the time I had to simply watch my brother and sisters mix together.</p><p>Must I suffer like this, while being unable to do anything, once more?</p><p>Ο</p><p>—&nbsp;Oh, humankind, what are subjects? They are everything! Only you can justly be referred to as people. Throughout the 1,500 years of history, what were commoners until now? They were nothing! And now, from this point on what must you, the peerless mankind, become?</p><p>— Everything!</p><p>Ο</p><p>As if intoxicated by a drug, the soldiers gazed up at the girl. Even though they should be unable to see the girl’s face since they did not possess binoculars, with the grandiosity of her voice, the girl was emitting a powerful presence. I shuddered.</p><p>So that is Dantalian’s sword.</p><p>So those are Dantalian’s words.</p><p>……That speech was most likely written by Dantalian. Aah, there is no doubt. I could hear that man’s voice within that girl’s voice. I could vaguely feel Dantalian’s outline in the words and sentences that the girl was reciting. Regardless, why was Dantalian not proclaiming the speech himself, and had instead, sent that girl as his replacement?</p><p>The reason was articulate.</p><p>The words that Dantalian had uttered, while we were shaking hands today, passed through my brain. Dantalian was grinning widely.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ο</p><p>— Oh dear, Elizabeth! I am Dantalian. Dantalian, I say.</p><p>—&nbsp;If you shine like the sun, then I will always be hiding in the dark moon. You will one day run out of vitality and collapse, however, I am unable to do so. I will never reveal myself, after all.</p><p>Ο</p><p>My heart trembled. It was difficult to admit the truth itself that my heart trembled when coming to the realization of fear and terror. Aah, so Dantalian is planning to&nbsp;<strong>hide</strong>. He plans to remain as the behind-the-scene manipulator and never reveal himself!</p><p>By placing Farnese as his stand-in, Dantalian will hide. The person to stand in the front to swing their blade and give orders will most likely be Farnese. Therefore, all the people of the continent will revere and despise Farnese. Even though the true culprit to incite them was Dantalian. While Farnese becomes that Demon Lord’s horse and spreads that Demon Lord’s words, Dantalian himself will be covered by the curtains of the performance and be caught by no one, allowing him to freely destroy the continent without being hindered by anything.</p><p>On the other hand.</p><p>I am unable to do so.</p><p>As the Imperial Princess of the Empire, that is impossible for me to do. I have to spend my time with hundreds of nobles surrounding me at all times. As there were always ears around me to hear the words I say, if I were to take action, then there will always be eyes to see the things that I do. Until now, I had treated my destiny of having been born as the Imperial Princess with gratitude. Not even for an instant, have I ever thought that my standing as the Imperial Princess could possibly become my weakness……!</p><p>The girl’s speech had reached its zenith. She unsheathed her longsword from her waist and raised it to the sky. Every single one of the soldiers held their breaths and were absorbed in the girl.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— I, Laura De Farnese, born as a human and branded as a slave, as a single peasant who is here now to struggle alongside you all, shall hereby declare! Be they humans, demons, commoners, or peasants, I shall struggle for the people without discriminating borders!</p><p>— You as well, fight back alongside me! Discard all the boundaries that oppress you all! Become free on your own, mankind!</p><p>Ο</p><p>That girl……So that child is Dantalian’s successor.</p><p>People were shocked by the news that that girl was a human. That was the effect that Dantalian was aiming for. Dantalian had utilized a human girl as his orator on purpose.</p><p>If the person to give the speech were, perhaps, a Demon Lord or a demon, then the soldiers would not have stirred. If the person to stand there were a noble, then the soldiers would have scorned the speech. However, Laura De Farnese, who was standing on top of that boulder, was not a Demon Lord or a noble&nbsp;and was simply a freeman with the blood of humans. She was a human. Since they were the words of a human, they naturally seeped into my subjects who were also humans.</p><p>“……Ha.”</p><p>Did laughter come when despair deepened?</p><p>I ended up unintentionally letting out a smirk.</p><p>Abruptly, who I was and where I stood became clear.</p><p>I was the Imperial Princess of the Empire. Until now, I have proven that I was the one and only Imperial Princess.</p><p>However, because Dantalian had suddenly appeared in that spot, he had defined what kind of fate lied behind me&nbsp;being the Imperial Princess. He was an existence that defined me.</p><p>“Dantalian……”</p><p>If I am to survive as the Imperial Princess, then I must take his life.</p><p>If I am to survive until the very end, then I must also take the life of that girl.</p><p>If I fail to do so, then the life that will fall will be mine.</p><p>“Demon Lord……!”</p><p>A certain ooze of emotion flowed out from my heart that was tightened by fear. Aha, I am certain that I am insane. Although there were existences that I must kill in order to stay alive in front of me, I felt pleasure in life from that.</p><p>“So you are my destiny……!”</p><p>He will most likely hide and not come out.</p><p>People will most likely never find out who he is.</p><p>But I know.</p><p>Ο</p><p><strong>Only I am looking at you.</strong></p><p>Ο</p><p>The universe is a meaningless crowd and if it were a solitary ocean, then a single island will drift on top and we will be seated there facing one another. Like the time we had faced the other with black and white stones, while in the center of today’s shower,&nbsp;our future from now on will be spent facing the other. Demon Lord, you are my destiny and I will surely be your fate as well.</p><p>Agitated, the nobles shouted. They browbeat the soldiers while striking their cheeks.</p><p>“You fools! What are you staring at absentmindedly!? Are you all unable to shout and prove to them that you are the subjects of the Empire!?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Do you want to become a traitor and die!?”</p><p>The soldiers quickly got down onto their knees and obeyed the nobles. However, I was aware. The other soldiers around them were glancing at the nobles with cold gazes. Was this the scenery that the Demon Lord had drawn in his dreams?</p><p>The aristocrats shouted and the officers and men remained silent. Since the angry scoldings were burly, they surged upwards to the sky, but quickly dissipated, however, the silence was cast down heavily and spread out widely. The air that was separated into two layers felt like the world that was soon going to be split into two sections. I, Elizabeth, will fall into the gap between that tear.</p><p>But what is the issue?</p><p>My life has become a single bliss. At last, my tomorrow was not going to be the repetition of today, and instead, be the day after today. Today, Dantalian had already fulfilled the promise that he had made me.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Demon Lord, could you die here together with me?</p><p>— I am fine with that, but is there a need to die right this instant?</p><p>—&nbsp;What point is there to live any longer when the light will fade after today? If it is now, then I can lightly depart.</p><p>—&nbsp;I promise you that the number of occurrences more pleasant than this will increase from now on.</p><p>Ο</p><p>How beautiful.</p><p>A beautiful voice. So these are the words of Dantalian.</p><p>So destiny was something that was so radiant and splendid that made even destruction into something that was blinding.</p><p>“……Ah.”</p><p>I shed a tear for the first time in my life.</p><p>On the 4th month and 3rd day, it seems I was born for the first time.</p><p>While joyously accepting the definition of my life to kill and be killed with that man, I closed my eyes. Since there was a single strand of melody in the world that was dark, it felt as if that girl was going to continue that melody forever. I, for a long time, while dwelling on that feeling, listened to that girl’s music that consisted not of melodies, but with words……</p><p>Ο</p><p>— You all, rage in everyone’s stead, and solely rage as mankind. Enlighten the people in power about who the original owners are. We shall sing. The song we sing shall be the song of vows where we swear that we will no longer descend from being owners and into slaves. The moment you raise your cries and hold your spears, the Gods will thus bring down upon us the glorious life with the name of tomorrow!</p><p>— Make them shudder. Make those authority figures tremble before the revolution of all. Other than your false shackles, you all have nothing else to lose in this revolution. Only the world that you must obtain, the everything that you must acquire, is spread out before you—</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>—Oh, humankind, fight back!</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>Ο</p><p>FIN.</p><p>Ο</p><p>(TL NOTE: DO NOT READ ON THE SITE READINGLIGHTNOVEL)</p><p>(THEY TAKE MY TRANSLATION WITHOUT PERMISSION AND PUT IN ADS)</p><hr><p>TL note: As a side note, this speech got its own Korean wiki page once volume 3 was released. People referred to it as ‘The speech of Bruno Plains’.</p><p>Anyway, once I’ve translated the intermission and afterword, volume 3 will be completely over! It shouldn’t take me too long to do both, so it should come out within the week, probably.</p><p>I will be starting another character poll once I put up the afterword. The characters will be strictly limited to the ones that have appeared in volume 3(sorry Ivar), and this time, I will also be putting up the characters that have died. Furthermore, I’ll also be uploading a gallery with all the HQ illustrations from volume 1 to volume 3.</p><p>I wonder if it’s too late to consider donations… I should probably ask the author soon…</p><p>Ehem. Anyway, see you guys in the intermission.</p>"

      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><h4>Intermission</h4><hr><h4>▯Demon Lord of Benevolence, Rank 9th,&nbsp;Paimon Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day&nbsp;3 Polles, Bruno Plains, Demon Lord Allied Forces</h4><p>—This lady held her breath.</p><p>For a moment, the breaths of demons and humans were held indiscriminately. Though it was no longer than a mere moment, to me, it felt as long as an eternity.</p><p>This lady has come to the realization. That the time that had just brushed by this lady, that the time that had scraped and flowed through every mortal&nbsp;in these plains, was not simply a demanded time but a moment of history instead. From this day forth, every historical book to be written will have no other choice but to use&nbsp;<strong>an entire page</strong>&nbsp;for this moment. For a single moment in this place, history existed.</p><p>However.</p><p>“……What the fuck is that?”</p><p>Similar to everything else, since history is something that is also buried underneath time and flows by, it is something that cannot be seen once it has passed. One individual at a time, the mouths of the Demon Lords, who had held their breaths because of something uncontrollable,&nbsp;opened. The words that came to their lips were not astonishment, admiration, or even imprecations, but.</p><p>“Why did Dantalian fucking hand the authority to give the speech to some human girl when we gave him that right? Did that idiot become mentally ill?”</p><p>Merely dissatisfaction.</p><p>That was it.</p><p>“Oi, old man Marbas. If my memory hasn’t turned to shit, I’m pretty sure our right of speech has never been taken by a human before.”</p><p>“That is to my understanding as well…… Things have become troubling. Barbatos, I’m just asking this for caution’s sake, but did you perhaps allow Dantalian to commit such conduct?”</p><p>“Am I mad? Why would I give a lowly human bitch the sacred position of rallying the Crescent Army……? In any case, I wonder if it’s because Dantalian is a rookie since he sometimes doesn’t know what’s right and wrong. That kid doesn’t know circumstance.”</p><p>“Not only is the form of the speech a problem, but the content of the speech has many issues as well. Planting the seed of division into the humans is excellent, however, how could segregating humans and demons be wrong? Though it seems Dantalian had used a defector of human birth as his performer in order to shake the enemy army…… He has gone too far. It goes against what is right and goes against custom.”</p><p>“Yeah. She’s saying something nonsensical.”</p><p>Aah.</p><p>This lady’s head became hazy because of the conversation shared between Barbatos and Marbas. That did not remain as the reaction of merely those two Demon Lords. All the Demon Lords who had witnessed that speech were most likely thinking along those lines as well. Prejudice or ignorance, or rather, a sense of disdain that should just be called blindness flowed through the atmosphere. Feeling suffocated by that sensation, it became difficult for me to breathe……</p><p>Humans and demons are equal. Commoners and nobles are equal. Therefore, as all the people, regardless of one’s race, should be in harmony, everyone should respect one another while disregarding one’s class…… This simple and clear truth could not be seen by their blind eyes. They could not see it at all. This lady was barely able to open her lips.</p><p>“Everyone……”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“Everyone, were you all unable to realize the meaning of that speech?”</p><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><p>Barbatos drew her brow together. A trivial body gesture such as that was more than enough to prove Barbatos’ natural ignorance. This lady gives up on trying to persuade her. It is impressive, Barbatos. You have the ability to repel this lady with the mere movement of your brow. I express my respect towards your ignorance.</p><p>“First, let’s punish Dantalian once the speech on the humans’ side is over.”</p><p>Punish? What do you mean by punishment?</p><p>This lady opened her eyes wide and gazed at Marbas. Beside Marbas, Barbatos was nodding her head as if it were obvious.</p><p>“If it had gone to only the mid-point, then we would have praised him, but since he has crawled at the absolute bottom, there is no other choice. We’re in a&nbsp;war, so for form’s sake, let’s just sentence him with confinement. And for that human, just whip her until she is nearly dead and pass it on adequately. If we really kill her then Dantalian would be pitiful……”</p><p>Confinement?</p><p>Whipping?</p><p>What sort of nonsense did they say just now?</p><p>……Barbatos has made Dantalian into her kept man. However, I am aware. I am aware that, by nature, Barbatos is not an individual who would share love with another. This lady had easily come to the conjecture that Barbatos was merely binding Dantalian with her body because he was necessary.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Regardless, to be able to do that so simply.</p><p>To be able to cast away the comrade and lover, who had saved her life and the lives of her army a month ago, like dirt.</p><p>“……”</p><p>Barbatos’ judgment may be correct in terms of political schemes. However, as that was not righteously correct, it was not politically correct either. &nbsp;This lady considers the rule that does not straightly seek justice and vastly ponders one’s reign, as something that is merely evil. Yes, without question, Barbatos is an evil woman.</p><p>This lady bit her lip and immediately went into calculating.</p><p>……If this lady’s faction&nbsp;could truly be able to obtain superiority in the situation where we go against both Barbatos and Marbas at the same time. If the other Demon Lords, who follow this lady, would truly agree to the decision obediently in the situation where I incorporate Dantalian into this lady’s Mountain Faction after having been hostile towards him all this time. All sorts of situations and hypotheses mixed together chaotically. In the center of that suffocating fog, a single sentence stood out naturally.</p><p>Just now,</p><p>I have seen for the first time in my life a person who&nbsp;had the same way of thought as I did.</p><p>“……”</p><p>This lady’s silence deepened. It is not the depth of an investigator who was heading down towards the bottom. It was the depth of a survivor who was sinking because there was no bottom or boundary. I have lost my path. It is suffocating.</p><p>……Paimon, you must not act out of emotions. Rationally, consider the political impact that would occur if you were to shelter Dantalian. Moreover, though I believe in the equality of commoners and nobles, I also acknowledge the&nbsp;<strong>necessity of peasants</strong>. People of ignoble birth exist everywhere. Witches are an example of that. However, Dantalian would most likely embrace even those peasants as well. Our way of thought is&nbsp;<strong>very slightly</strong>&nbsp;different. In short, there is no need to assimilate myself with Dantalian on an emotional level. Calm down. Emotions will only ruin you. Calm down. An opportunity will always come……</p><p>“Wait. Now that I think about it. Can’t we just drag Dantalian here right now?”</p><p>Barbatos had spoken.</p><p>“The orator is that human anyway, so we can leave her be and just bring Dantalian here to punish.”</p><p>“Indeed, that is a fair point. You bring him.”</p><p>……</p><p>Paimon.</p><p>You cannot.</p><p>Look back at yourself objectively. You are the leader of the Mountain Faction. You are in possession of the largest faction within the Demon Lord armies. If you determine your position on impulse, then that influence will be directly taken in by the other Demon Lords. Please. If you have lived for 500 years then you should be sensible. Is it not sufficient for the Demon Lord, who forever behaves like a child, to remain as solely Barbatos? That is right, Paimon. Calm down. The reason why you always feel suffocated is because you think that you are suffering from angina. If you inhale slowly, then everything will be alri……</p><p>“Hey, bitch.”</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>“Why are you wordlessly blocking my fucking way, you bitch?”</p><p>Barbatos was looking up at my face from below. That vulgar face, which looked like it would spit right this instant, verified how Barbatos-like she was.</p><div></div><p>……Ara?</p><p>When did this lady walk here?</p><p>I do not recall having walked here. Clearly, I was standing at the other side a second ago. Right now, this lady was blocking Barbatos’ path towards Dantalian. This is strange. This is really strange. If I do not return quickly……</p><p>“You fucker, try living while taking out some fat from your chest. Since you shove your stomach fat into your tits, a shitty smell is coming off. Really, a fucking vomit-inducing scent is emanating since the smell of your tits and the smell of oil is mixed together.”</p><p>“……”</p><p>If I do not return quickly.</p><p>“Oh? You aren’t going to fuck off? What are you going to do if you glare at me? In any case, you really do live up to your name as the most ragged bitch among the succubi since even your gaze is fickle. There are countless numbers of demons who want to do it through your eye socket, and yet you’ve managed to live without becoming one-eyed yet? Do you want me to introduce you to someone? Or will you lower your eyes before I introduce you to them?”</p><p>“……”</p><p>Please.</p><p>Rationally.</p><p>Not emotionally.</p><p>“Hey. Hey. Move it. You aren’t going to move? Did this bitch go insane? Fuck—.”</p><p>“Is the person who’s emanating the foul scent of breasts not you, Barbatos? I thought that I was unable to see you since you were so short, but after looking at it today, your breasts are also so small that I thought you were a man. How about putting a clear-cut indication somewhere on you in order to allow other people to know that you are a girl? That’s right.&nbsp;Such as writing the words “I am a whore” in red letters on your forehead, try something like that. Is it not good since it is so distinct?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ah.</p><p>Aaaaah.</p><p>I-I am not saying this!</p><p>I am not uttering these words because I want to!</p><p>My body, the body that had moved on its own a second ago, was now controlling my mouth and moving my tongue on its own volition. Yes. It is true. This is not my intention, but—.</p><p>“What nonsense are you saying? The whore is you, you ragged bitch. They say that the number of castaway demons, who went into your hole and weren’t able to find their way out, reaches nearly 200 people this year. Is that why your belly is so flabby since you have 200 people inside you? Whores go around saying that they ‘devour men’, but you must be quite well off since you literally go around eating men, huh?”</p><p>—This dog bone-like girl.</p><p>Does she want to die?</p><p>“Why is this child, who could not satisfy the appetite of even a goblin if one were to twist and sever off her limbs, throwing an epileptic fit and trying to start a fight with this lady while not knowing of her place? Hm? Since their chest is already flat, should we shave their hair and make their head flat as well? It seems that they have yet to learn how to fix their dog-like antics from their childhood and is coming at me again, despite the fact that I had already once shaved their head 300 years ago when they went insane. If they understand that their chest is ugly, then they should at least rip their mouth out and attach it to their nipple and pretend to have breasts. You seem to be living quite well despite having such a shameful washboard attached to you. Well, since your subordinates are corpses that had come back to life, they most likely do not have anything down there. Your subordinates do not have anything below, and you do not have anything above, so your&nbsp;mutual settlement is quite marvelous. Though I am only saying this because the sight of you getting along with your corpses is so pretty, since you are playing with dead corpses anyway, can you not die a little as well?”</p><p>“Aaaaaaang–?”</p><p>“What will you do by glaring at me?”</p><p>Barbatos and I glared at each other ferociously. Do you think someone does not swear because they do not know how to? Because they have dignity and rationality, they are restraining themselves. They are an existence that is completely different from you who lacks both face and sense.</p><p>In that moment, the sound of footsteps could be heard. It was Dantalian. Having discovered us making a ruckus, Dantalian carefully approached us.</p><p>“I apologize. The speeches on both sides have yet to come to an end, so if Barbatos and Miss Paimon can be quiet for a moment……”</p><p>“Hey, Dantalian. You came at a good time.”</p><p>Barbatos got on her tiptoes and looked at Dantalian. She most likely intends to grab Dantalian like this and punish him. Though they had stated that it was going to be nothing more than a punishment for formality’s sake, formality is where punishment starts from. Do you think this lady will leave it be?</p><p>“Why are you doing the speech so poorly like that? Get hit by me a bit. For now, go inside a cage and repent on your life—.”</p><p>“Be quiet, Barbatos.”</p><p>“……What?”</p><p>“I said to be quiet.”</p><p>This lady stretched out her right arm and put it between Barbatos and Dantalian. Yes, I obstructed her. In the end, I blocked her.</p><p>Rationality? Political calculations? Put all those things away. Since long ago, this lady has lived based on her emotions. Despite doing so, this lady was able to form the greatest faction within the army of Demon Lords. Thus meaning, the more this lady acts according to her emotions, the more fortune comes rolling to her feet. Verification is complete. I will not accept any counter-arguments.</p><p>For now, if I am able to witness the sight&nbsp;of this child in front of me contorting her face, I will be satisfied with that.</p><p>“Henceforth, Dantalian is no longer the ally of the Plains Faction, but instead, is a Demon Lord who is supported by the Mountain Faction led by myself, Paimon. If you wish to punish Dantalian, then either obtain the consent of the Mountain Faction or proceed through a formal ballot during a Walpurgis Night.”</p><p>“……Ha?”</p><p>“Oh dear. Now that I think about it, the procedure of holding a Walpurgis Night during a war is incredibly complex and intricate. How unfortunate, Barbatos. Since you will have to return bitterly while holding onto that bitter chest, after all.”</p><p>“You…… Paimon. What are you saying?”</p><p>“Do you still not understand?”</p><p>This lady smirked. In truth, this lady was speaking in accordance to however her tongue moved while a lot of blood had rushed to her head. I am unable to even properly register what I am currently saying. It is this lady’s nature to become like this whenever she becomes mad.</p><p>“That man is not your property.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>This lady pointed towards Dantalian with the edge of her fan.</p><p>“He is now&nbsp;<strong>mine</strong>.”</p><p>“…………”</p><p>Barbatos’ face slowly started to distort.</p><p>That is right. This is it. If this lady is able to see this face, then she is able to endure both torture and abuse. Aah, truly. My entire insides feel refreshed. Why would one go against this lady with what little ability they have, and brazenly display their own stupidity, ignorance, and imprudence to the entire world? Truly, for Barbatos to understand……</p><p>…………Ara?</p><p>I looked around. For some reason, the Demon Lords around me were all frozen like statues. It felt as if even the air had frozen.</p><p>………What did this lady say just now?</p><p>FIN.</p><hr><p>TL Note: We have now arrived at the end of volume 3 of Dungeon Defense. There’s the afterword next, but a majority of you guys usually skip or skim through that. Anyway, now that I’ve caught up to all the released volumes for now, I’ll be able to get some proper rest without having to stress over the fact that I should be translating.</p><p>I’ll be leaving a longer “TL’er Afterword” underneath the author’s, so you guys can read the rest there.</p><p>Anyway, thank you all for reading Dungeon Defense, and I hope to see you guys when volume 4 is released!</p>"

      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><h4><strong>Afterword</strong></h4><hr><p>At times, when an author sends their manuscripts out to the world, they say that ‘It feels as if I’m sending off my child”. That is a comparison that is truly right. Since, be it a manuscript or one’s child, a person’s inside will be seriously mixed together in the thing they send off, after all.</p><p>The feces and urine of a just born infant are the chaos of the manuscript, the child’s puberty is the slump of the manuscript, and the allowance they give you after leaving home is the payment of the manuscript. Occasionally, authors refer to the process of writing a manuscript as ‘giving birth’, but that is incorrect. The problem is raising it properly after having given birth. Only the pain of patience continues in this procedure of raising……</p><p>Therefore, as an afterword is the letter being sent to the child that you had already sent off completely, it is the words you write with the goodness of your hearts to express the words, ‘I am incredibly pleased that I do not have to raise you any longer.’. Ah! How beautiful can the world be? How much of a blessing could it be to not have to see that child of yours ever again!? Leave, leave forever…… but, if possible, send a lot of allowance. And don’t visit me in person……. All I have now is gratitude towards all the things that happen in the world.</p><p>Regardless, as the person that I am the most grateful towards among all the happenings in the world is cocorip, I do not suspect that you readers were also able to feel that cocorip’s illustrations were able to reach the stage of Gods without having me tell you. The color illustrations are especially a feast of surprises. I have never seen a light novel illustration with a shade as beautiful as this. Although the lines ‘BRAVE NEW WORLD’ and ‘Everything or Nothing’ are in them, the illustrations are so perfect that I feel sorry about the fact that these lines are covering the images. I am a happy author when writing the afterword. I am able to easily fill 500 pages of praises towards the illustrator, after all! Although it is possible for me to write down all these words of praise and fill 500 pages, unfortunately, since there are not enough pages, I have no other choice but to omit those. cocorip, I give you my word of appreciation.</p><p>I said that the manuscript is like a child that is mixed with the mind of the author, but the author is even more like the child that is mixed with the mind of the editor. For example, as an alcoholic child can at least be scolded and a drug-addicted child cannot be dealt with, among those children, the child that became addicted to alcohol, drugs, and gambling, and obtained the three crowns of glory, has absolutely no answers. Mother… no, Editor… I’m sorry. Far from giving it to you quickly, though I had certainly promised to hastily give you the manuscript in the afterword of the 2nd volume, I ended up presenting it to you a month after the promised date. In the world of manuscripts, the time known as a month is, in truth, the same as 10 years in the world of raising a child. To the mother who had waited 10 years for me, I can only wail as a thankless child. Mother…! No, editor…! I’ll quit drinking, quit drugs, and quit gambling…… I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Please forgive me.</p><div></div><p>Not only did the editor wait, but they had given helpful advice on character development. The editor isn’t an editor who interferes with the story with advice, but an editor who leads the story into a better direction through their advice. For example, in one of the character developments of &lt;Dungeon Defense&gt; Volume 3, during the first meeting between Dantalian and Elizabeth, towards my contemplation on what sort of conversation would be appropriate for them, the editor advised me that ‘It would be good if they said nothing’. It was a perfectly appropriate advice. If the two were true arch-rivals, then they must be able to recognize one another without speaking any words and only with a single glance. Thank you to the editor who gave me advice such as this.</p><p>The last people I must thank is, indeed, you readers.</p><p>Although I have not determined whether my manuscripts are my sons or daughters, though I did not decide on their gender (of course, there may be a third or possibly a fourth gender here), anyway, the people who had received and kept alive these newborn children of mine are you, readers. If there are broken or wrong parts in the manuscript, then those are all the ruin and wrongdoings that had come from my mind while raising the manuscript, and yet, by the truth that the ones to endure those fractures and wrongdoings of my manuscript are you readers, I can only be terrified. As you all are not a member of the family, I can only hope that you readers will read it happily. Thank you for taking in my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd daughters and son…… Thank yo……? Ara, is this comparison wrong……? No, I mean…… I see.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Thank you, readers, for making a harem with my children.</p>"

      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><h3>Volume 4 – Chapter 1 The Season that is not Mine</h3><h4></h4><p><strong>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian</strong></p><p><strong> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 3</strong></p><p><strong> Bruno Plains, Army of the Crescent Alliance</strong></p><p>Ο</p><p>The female and male dogs that I saw yesterday were mating today as well.</p><p>In the middle of the plain. While forcefully making those humans over there and the demons here into their audience, they were copulating in front of a massive army that was no less than two hundred thousand. The soldiers tossed stones at them and laughed. Although both the humans and demons were laughing, they were both too far away to actually hit the dogs, so within the field that couldn’t be touched, the mutts were able to mate freely.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ Do not throw stones!</p><p>⎯⎯ Behave, you scoundrels. The Gods are watching.</p><p>Ο</p><p>The noncommissioned officers lashed the bottoms of the soldiers. They cautioned them to not disturb the dogs. They said that it was imprudent. To me, it was vague whether the soldiers, who were throwing stones at the mutts when a war was about to unfold, were the ones who were imprudent, or the officers, who were going out of their way to scold the soldiers, were the ones who were actually imprudent. Do not throw stones stop throwing. The sounds of stones being tossed and the sounds of urging resonated all the way to the far fields, and as it spread out far, it slowly extended the time of the field.</p><p>Farnese muttered flatly.</p><p>“They are late. Did you say it was the Imperial Princess Elizabeth?”</p><p>“That is right. Albeit, I expected her to come out right away.”</p><p>Us two, master and servant, were standing side by side and gazing at the human army encampment over on the other side of the plain.</p><p>The negotiation area where the Imperial Princess and I had played Go in this morning had completely burned down. The tent had turned into rubble and was sprawled out in the center of the field. The Crown Prince of the Empire and the descendants of the Margrave were most likely dead underneath those remains. Although we were unable to see the corpses from here, crows would occasionally swoop down and disappear between the rubble. I pictured in my mind the image of the crows pecking and eating away at the bare facial area of the Crown Prince who had his face skinned off. The meat which was earnestly skinned and cooked to a crisp most likely suited the taste of the crows.</p><p>Our speech had ended. It was now the Imperial Princess Elizabeth’s turn to give hers. Due to the fact that the Imperial Princess has still yet to show herself, the soldiers were passing their time with the mating dogs.</p><p>Every now and then, the soldiers of the demon army would jeer at the lateness of the human army representative by shouting ‘Boo’. Come out already, what are you doing, did they run away because they’re scared? Despite that, the Imperial Princess did not reveal herself. Side by side, the copulating mutts, the corpse eating crows, and the soldiers that came here in order to go to war all appeared to be at leisure.</p><p>“Farnese, do you believe in God?”</p><p>“The Gods did not help this young lady even when her life was grim. Be it a God or a Devil, if they do not help this young lady, then what is there to care about? This young lady does not strain her nerves for needless things.”</p><p>Farnese looked this way.</p><p>“How about you, Lord? Do you believe in God?”</p><p>“Of course. It is difficult to find someone who is as purely devout as I am.”</p><p>“I see Your Lordship’s ridiculousness is bitter today.”</p><p>“I will see you after the speech is over.”</p><p>“For what reason does Your Lordship have to see this young lady later? This young lady is right before Your Lordship’s eyes at this very moment. Look at this young lady’s beautiful face as much as Your Lordship desires until you become tired of it. Oh, now that this young lady thinks about it, was Your Lordship not a eunuch who is unable to get aroused when looking at women besides Miss Lapis? Lord, this young lady apologizes. This young lady did not consider Your Lordship’s impotence. Since this young lady has ignored the situation of Your Lordship’s lower half, she cannot be truly referred to as your faithful subject.”</p><p>“This girl.”</p><p>She’s quite elated just because she finished giving her speech.</p><p>Of course, in Farnese’s position, she must be delighted. Even if she had acted after having become my puppet, she was finally able to drop her name into the world. Her name will most likely be recorded in history as the revolutionist of the century. Different to Lapis and I, who pursued absolute authority, Farnese chased after reputation, and this very day was now her splendid anniversary day.</p><p>Similar to a young child who was delighted at having received a gift.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>This girl known as Laura De Farnese was purely feeling pleased.</p><p>Despite the fact that she had actually driven mankind into an endless slaughter.</p><p>“This young lady’s speech was perfect.”</p><p>Farnese spoke.</p><p>“To be exact, it would be correct to say that it was a speech that was achieved through the cooperation of Your Lordship and this young lady. Henceforth, the continent will be split into two ranks and the countryside will be strewn with corpses and drenched with blood. Is Your Lordship still worried about the woman known as Elizabeth despite that? Honestly speaking, this young lady is not afraid.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>I glanced at the plain spread out before us. There was no need to give an answer. Even if she were unaware now, she will see it for herself soon enough and will thus understand once she has witnessed it. Although there were many people in the world who were incapable of understanding something despite having seen it themselves, Farnese was my greatest pupil. She will be able to realize it well on her own.</p><p>The wind blew over the field. Woosh. Due to the sudden shower that came down this morning, our vision could not reach out far and was forced to flicker within a close area. Everything was close. The rough palms of the noncommissioned officers which were striking the soldiers were close, the panting of the female and male dogs that were mating was close, and the violently flapping enemy flags on the other side of the field were close. Woooosh. The wind blew for a moment, and the field became still after the drivel was swept away. I could sense that something was approaching.</p><p>“She’s here.”</p><p>“What are you referring to, Lord?”</p><p>“Watch well. That is your sworn enemy.”</p><p>Farnese tilted her head and turned towards the place I was gazing at. It was at the instant she had fully turned her gaze. Elizabeth’s speech started as if it were a gust of wind that was blowing from that side of the field to this.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ Soldiers of many nations, do not be fooled by the sweet whispers of the devil.</p><p>Ο</p><p>As if hundreds of thousands of soldiers were being guided by the wind, their gaze went towards the girl. We were unable to see the Imperial Princess herself because she was too far away, however, solely her voice felt endlessly near.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ They are all demons and monsters. Have you all not lost your parents, friends, and comrades to the wicked fangs of those monsters? Behold. For someone who is wearing the skin of humans, that girl is standing between those monsters. I refer to the ones who live alongside devils as a devil themselves so that child is certainly one of them.</p><p>Ο</p><p>I pulled out a portable telescope from my coat and looked out into the distance. My vision moved between banners and flags. As I was still unable to see where the Imperial Princess Elizabeth was, I carefully estimated her location solely by the sound of her voice which felt as if it were being whispered directly into my ear.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ The devil spoke. They claimed that we had killed our own people. Where can you find a lie that is as immense as this? The devil stated that you all are on their side and are their allies. Where else can you find a lie that is as massive as this as well?</p><p>⎯⎯ This is something that you all should ask yourselves. 400 years ago, who were the ones to put their lives on the line in order to protect the continent? 300 years ago, who were the ones to abandon their lives in order to protect mankind?</p><p>⎯⎯ 250 years ago, who were the ones to swing their blades underneath the white walls until the last man standing? 200 years ago, who were the ones to charge towards the monsters on the Plains of Ulm?</p><p>⎯⎯ And on this day, in order to fight against a hundred thousand monsters once more, there are people here who have thrown everything aside for their family, for their sons and daughters, and for the Gods. This is something you must ask yourselves! Who are these people!?</p><p>⎯⎯ That is so. These people are you.</p><p>⎯⎯ 400 years ago, 300 years ago, 200 years ago, and here on this very day, the ones devoting their lives in order to protect the continent are you, and solely you!</p><p>Ο</p><p>Elizabeth declared. She did not make any wasted breaths. Because there was no needless noise, it felt as if her voice was a melody that was slowly intensifying. The human soldiers were entranced by the tune and were all facing towards a single spot. With my telescope, I followed their gazes. She was calling for me.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ Oh proud officers and men of many nations, the ones who were always slaughtered by those monsters were you, the people. The places that those monsters always pillaged were the fields cultivated by you, the people. As the ones those monsters always stepped on were our fathers and mothers, every time we attempted to live peacefully those monsters cruelly trampled on our lives.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>⎯⎯ Now a devil speaks to you. They claimed that they themselves have never threatened the people. I ask you all. Is that true?</p><p>The surroundings were still.</p><p>The atmosphere that was heated up by the speech given by Farnese earlier had settled down. The enemy forces that Farnese separated into peasants and nobles were once again embraced as one by Elizabeth, and the Imperial Princess started calling out each army that was gathered together.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ Boeotians. I remember. 400 years ago, on the rocky plains of Aulis, you desperately protected one of humanity’s lines of defense with your lives, combatting against thirty thousand monsters for more than three days. The great prince that led you, Peneleos, rests underneath the hill alongside your brethren.</p><p>⎯⎯ Tribe of Minyans. I remember. 300 years ago, at the region of doves, Thisvi, although a monster from the netherworld was approaching, you were able to protect your city with merely 400 men. Regardless of the city’s authority, the aristocrats, the citizens, and the slaves, you all became one and retaliated together. Humankind shall never forget your struggle.</p><p>⎯⎯ People of Aspledon. who could possibly forget the legendary battle that you all displayed 150 years ago!?</p><p>Ο</p><p>The moment she said that line, a single group cheered. The tribe known as Aspledon had given a fervent response.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ Hurrah for Aspledon! Hurrah for Aspledon!</p><p>Ο</p><p>It was from that moment on. Elizabeth’s naming was no longer a simple role call, but it was now a massive echo that shook the human army. Each time the Imperial Princess called out to a tribe or a city, the soldiers who were dispatched from those places would shake their flags fiercely and cheer.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ Locrians, the people who lived while cultivating the water from the honorable River of Cephissus! I remember. 200 years ago, you all beheaded no less than 2 dragons in Euboea. Even the Goddesses of Heaven must have been moved by your achievement!</p><p>⎯⎯ Locris! Locris! Locris!</p><p>Ο</p><p>Thud Thud, the soldiers from a single army started slamming the butts of their spears against the ground. They were shouting while holding pride towards their homeland. They were most likely not ordered to do so, but the drummers lifted their drumsticks and started to pound heavily on their drums, which were made from cowhide. Bang Bang. While the earth shook because of the roars, the air trembled due to the drums. Between the shaking and trembling, Elizabeth’s voice was free.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ People of Abantes! People of Alpheus! Your glorious battle is still engraved onto each and every stone wall of your stronghold. When I was six-years-old, while brushing my boundlessly young hand over the engraved names on those walls, I made a resolution. That I will remember the names of the brave men written here on these walls forever. Therefore, I shall call out to your ancestors. Adrastus, Menestheus, Elephenor, Styra, Opoüs, Scarphe, Augeae, Tarphes⎯⎯⎯⎯.</p><p>Ο</p><p>She had truly memorized all of the names and were calling them out one at a time. Her voice slowly became louder and louder. The shaking and trembling of the soldiers followed after her voice and rose up steeply.</p><p>Once the number of names she called out had reached over 20, the soldiers cheered, once the number of names she shouted out had reached over 30, the soldiers threw up their hats, and once the number of names she cried out had finally reached over 50, the entire army of humans had become one and were shouting together.</p><p>Aah.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ Oh, mankind!</p><p>Ο</p><p>How beautiful, Elizabeth.</p><p>One piece at a time, you embroidered together the humankind that I had broken into fragments. If my speech was sharp and had sliced them apart, then you had applied glue to each severed side and gently pulled them together. Although I had incited their rage and hatred, Elizabeth led them by using their pride towards their homeland and with the illusion that humankind was one.</p><p>No one wanted to call themselves a peasant. No matter who it was, people would want to believe that they were only <strong>human</strong>. Before being referred to as a peasant, they wanted to be referred to as a human. Before discussing hierarchy, they favored their homes, and before leaping into a divide, they loved harmony.</p><p>Elizabeth knew that.</p><p>She knew the fact that love could be instigated as easily as hatred could.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ You all, who were called by thousands of names yesterday, are here today as Habsburg, Francia, Brittany, Batavia, Teuton, Castile, Sardinia, Anatolia, Moscow, Kalmar, and Bernicia. However, we know. We know that we were originally one!</p><p>⎯⎯ At times, humankind became disunited. At times, humankind resented one another. However, regardless of all that, we were still one. Whenever those monsters pillaged our loveable land and slaughtered our families and comrades, we always became one and struggled together!</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>⎯⎯ Scorn and hatred were unable to stop us. Even the strong canines of the monsters were unable to separate us. That is so, it is because we are human. It is because we were born as humans, and until our final moments, we will more than gladly desire to die as just humans!</p><p>⎯⎯ As our struggle was not towards mankind itself.</p><p>⎯⎯ Our struggle was solely for the sake of mankind!</p><p>Finally, my telescope discovered Elizabeth. It was as if the silver haired Imperial Princess were looking this way from the very beginning since it felt as if our eyes met each other across this vast distance.</p><p>Elizabeth unsheathed her sword and raised it. It was a silver sword. A single ray of light made its way through a gap between the murky clouds and made the Imperial Princess’ sword shine a bright silver. Every time Elizabeth shouted, the soldiers would respond by saying ‘That’s right’.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ Today, on this very day, mankind has once again reached a moment where everyone has become a single group. More than before, those monsters are stronger and more malicious. They know that they can only win if we were to be divided. You all must have heard well their false whispers. But how can one forget? The fact that humankind has always been one!</p><p>⎯⎯ That’s right! That’s right!</p><p>⎯⎯ For hundreds of years, those monsters put considerable efforts into separating us. But we remember. The fact that humankind has always been one!</p><p>⎯⎯ That’s right! That’s right!</p><p>⎯⎯ Today, they are once again trying to make us separate. However, we know. The fact that, on this day, humankind is surely one! As our ancestors have done so before, as we are doing so today, and as our descendants will do so tomorrow, humans will continue to forever exist as a single mankind!</p><p>⎯⎯ That’s right! That’s right!</p><p>Ο</p><p>Elizabeth placed her blade against her hand and cut her palm. The bandages were torn and crimson blood started to flow. She clenched the blood and shouted.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ I, Elizabeth of Habsburg, hereby vow. I shall always stand on the front lines throughout the defending war, which will unfold from this day forth. Whenever you wish to kneel before the ruthlessness of those monsters, I shall be directly behind you, supporting your backs. Whenever you are looking forward in despair, because of those monsters’ cruelty, I shall be standing right there!</p><p>Ο</p><p>Elizabeth opened her fist. The blood that had gathered on her palm scattered all at once and flew throughout the air. As if trying to repay for every single drop of blood, the soldiers shouted. Finally, ignoring their homelands, their roars mixed together chaotically and could not be understood anymore.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ Today, some will die and some will survive. Here, in this place, the blood of mankind will be drunk greedily by the Bruno Plains. Leave it be. Let the plains drink as much blood as it desires! If our thirst is quenched by doing so, then so be it. Since today will be mankind’s cruel carnival!</p><p>⎯⎯ Officers and men of many nations! The people, the descendants of your proud ancestors! Alongside me, will you prove to those malicious monsters once more that we are still humans!?</p><p>⎯⎯ That’s right!</p><p>⎯⎯ Have you finished strengthening your resolves to remain in the history of blood once more!?</p><p>⎯⎯ That’s right!</p><p>Ο</p><p>The horizon shook because of the roars. Flags were waving. The drummers continued to pound the cowhide boisterously. Like thunder that had no tempo or rhythm, the noise uttered by the human army of a hundred thousand soldiers shook the earth and the sky.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ For war!</p><p>⎯⎯ For war!</p><p>Ο</p><p>Following after, the soldiers chanted for war three or four more times. Elizabeth was able to wash the poison known as class strife, which I had spread throughout their army, clean. At the very least, it seems something like their fighting spirit falling apart will not happen today. How splendid. Surely, it was worthy of the girl who I had acknowledged to be my lifelong formidable enemy.</p><p>“.”</p><p>Farnese was silent beside me. The delighted frivolous atmosphere, which she possessed immediately after her speech was over, had disappeared without a trace. She was merely staring hard at the sight of the human army cheering. I had heard from somewhere that the temperature of one’s gaze was the same as their heart. If that was the case, then, in the end, Farnese’s heart was mostly likely frozen like winter. I stroked Farnese’s head.</p><p>“How was it? Are you still not worried?”</p><p>“For 2 months, this young lady had prepared for today’s speech. If you include the time spent learning from Miss Lapis, then it is no less than half a year. That speech, this young lady, and Your Lordship’s strike.”</p><p>“That is so.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I nodded my head.</p><p>“That Imperial Princess had toppled our blow in merely 10 minutes. She most likely thought of countermeasures promptly after she heard our speech. She devised a speech in her head without any previous preparations whatsoever.”</p><p>Farnese, the girl, who you and I must face from now on, is that kind of monster. If we are unable to take the Imperial Princess’ life, then in return, the Imperial Princess will take ours. As a result, the hero to have their name remain in history will be her. At most, the girl known as Farnese will be recorded as the failed revolutionary and defeated general.</p><p>With no emotion on her face, Farnese bit her bottom lip.</p><p>“Elizabeth. Elizabeth Atanaxia, Evatriae, von Habsburg.”</p><p>Farnese pronounced the name of the woman, who was going to become her sworn enemy, in detail. Farnese’s voice was sanguinary. Similar to the way she had pronounced it, it was as if she intended to slice up the Imperial Princess’ body, in detail.</p><p>“This young lady cannot forgive her. The one who will become the owner of this age is none other than this young lady. For that sole purpose, this young lady became Your Lordship’s vassal. How could this young lady possibly leave alone that sort of girl when she intends to obstruct this young lady’s ambitions?”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>I was pleased by this girl’s murderous intent. That’s right. I wanted <strong>this sort of reaction</strong>. Because I wanted this kind of response, I threw away the other heroes of the future and chose Laura De Farnese.</p><p>No matter how radiant the opposition was, I needed that superciliousness that could consider something as a hindrance solely for the reason that that radiance was blocking their path.</p><p>A cruelty that didn’t waver even the slightest amount when before the bombastic pretext of protecting mankind, a personality that is capable of killing the things that must be silently killed, and if the opposition cannot be killed, then someone who can make do by killing whatever else possible.</p><p>As Farnese was a supercilious and cruel girl, the Imperial Princess, Elizabeth, was nothing more than an unwelcomed guest that was interfering with her enjoyable and peaceful time. Farnese was a psychopath. That is why I chose this child instead of anyone else.</p><p>There were many people who would say it was lonely when the wind blew. There were numerous people who would leave after saying they have to go somewhere whenever the wind blew. However, child, who is as loveable as my younger sister, since the wind has blown, you and I are people who demand the flags to be raised. Even if Elizabeth were a storm that was similar to a calamity, to us, that was nothing more than a signal to raise our banners.</p><p>“Lord.”</p><p>Farnese looked up at me. A faint tint of hatred could be seen in the pupils of this child who rarely displayed any emotions. It almost felt as if she were a child who just had her playground invaded and was pestering her father about it.</p><p>“This young lady shall kill that woman. Please allow this young lady to do so.”</p><p>“Not yet.”</p><p>I shook my head. Farnese furrowed her brow.</p><p>“Why not? Did Your Lordship not bring this young lady from the slave market in order to kill that woman? Your Lordship was right. This young lady understands now, as well. The fact that a woman like that cannot be killed by just anyone. However, if it is this young lady, then she will certainly be able to kill her.”</p><p>“Be patient. The time has yet to come.”</p><p>I slowly persuaded my best pupil. Although the curtains of the play have risen and the theatricals have begun, there were still many crises to overcome. In order to kill Macbeth, one must arrive at the fourth act first.</p><p>“Although taking the life of a single individual is a small task, it is something that I must do personally. There are thousands of humans we must kill, tens of thousands. How do you expect to properly subdue Elizabeth when we are surrounded by people that we must kill?”</p><p>“Your words are ambiguous, Lord. Please tell this young lady your true meaning.”</p><p>“I am saying that it is unwieldy to face the opponent in the front while leaving aside the enemy that is in the back.”</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>“We have an alliance with Barbatos’ Plains Faction, but that relationship is strictly limited to one where we merely use one another. Just because the benefit is firm, does not mean that even the trust is adamant. Moreover, the head that is leading the greatest faction in the demon continent, the Mountain Faction, is Paimon. That fellow is hostile towards us.”</p><p>Farnese narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“This young lady understands. It seems we must get rid of the bothersome things in the rear first. Since we would most likely have an upset stomach if we get too greedy, it would be best to rip them apart one bite at a time.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Bingo. That is how a lion hunts a deer.”</p><p>I lightly pulled on Farnese’s cheek. This was a physical contact which contained the meaning of praise. Albeit, Farnese did not like it and was groaning, ‘Uuuh’.</p><p>“Who do you plan on going for first?”</p><p>“Paimon is first.”</p><p>I answered immediately.</p><p>I had a deep ill-fated relationship with Paimon, anyway. From the very beginning, when I had aimed for the cure of the disease and had instantly accumulated great wealth, Paimon was vigilant towards me. Perhaps I should say that she was excessively vigilant. She had a lot of hostility piled up towards a dangerous son of a bitch like me, after all. To this very day, I cannot recall leaving alone even <strong>a single person</strong> who dared to hinder my life.</p><p>Fortunately, the gift that the Imperial Princess Elizabeth had given to me was resting in my coat pocket. A pocket watch. Memoria Artifact. The very item which contained the scene where I had to burn down a slave market in order to appoint Farnese.</p><p>Originally, Humbaba was the one who had recorded with this object, and she had sold it to Paimon. That pocket watch was in the Imperial Princess Elizabeth’s hands. It meant that it went from Humbaba to Paimon, and from Paimon to Elizabeth. What does this mean?</p><p>The answer was actually simple.</p><p>“Paimon sold information about myself to the Empire.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>“She most likely informed the Empire that I was the true culprit behind the start of this war in secret. She passed on my personal information while she was at it. Furthermore, of all people, it had to be the Imperial Princess Elizabeth. An underhanded betrayer.”</p><p>I chuckled slightly.</p><p>“Was she called a whore who would sell her body to peddlers? Barbatos’ words were indeed correct. In order to stop me, Paimon, that woman, sold not only her body but her soul as well. It is now her turn to pay the price drastically.</p><p>Without a doubt, I had done my utmost. Paimon, even if your side was the one to have attacked first, I treated you with courtesy. However, you not only interfered with every single thing I did, but your act of betrayal has been revealed, as well. You have clearly crossed the boundary.</p><p>Earlier, since the area behind us was a bit noisy, I had come down from the boulder. I discovered that Barbatos and Paimon were quarreling. I had no idea what was going on but Paimon had pointed towards me and declared <strong>‘That man is mine from now on’</strong>. Due to that, a small fuss had occurred.</p><p>Paimon most likely realized that her betrayal had been revealed. I am not sure how she figured it out, but she has a stifling information network. She knew that she was in peril since her disclosure was revealed, and that was why she had urgently tried to win me over by saying ‘Join my faction’.</p><p>How laughable.</p><p>It’s too late, Paimon.</p><p>If you were afraid of having your betrayal discovered, then you should not have committed it in the first place. If you had already carried out the betrayal, then you should have done whatever you could in order to not allow me to catch wind of it until the very end. If you were the former, then you would have been a kind person, and if you were the latter, then you would have been a sensible person. However, you were neither this or that. You were both unkind and idiotic. I am not foolish enough to let that sort of prey go.</p><p>Farnese spoke in a low voice.</p><p>“Lord, this young lady is your sword. This blade will only be swung in the places that Your Lordship commands for it to be swung. However, is that fine? There are enemies in our front and a backstabber in our rear. Although people say that one must punish the betrayer before facing the enemy, similar to that reasoning, a logic where one must face the enemy forces before punishing the traitor, is also established. This is a formidable situation.”</p><p>I nodded my head. That was a good point. Indeed, it was worthwhile for Lapis and myself to invest our time in personally tutoring this girl. They say that a sparrow near a school can sing the primer, and that seemed to be the case.</p><p><em>(TL note: A saying in Korea that means “One can be influenced by their surroundings”)</em></p><p>“It is fine. I have something in mind in regards to that. Are we not holding out as Barbatos’ allies? Even to Barbatos, Paimon is an annoying political rival. If we throw out grounds to purge Paimon, then Barbatos will obviously dash in with no reluctance whatsoever.”</p><p>“Mm. Surely.”</p><p>“Lapis should have started to slowly pull in the required chessman by now. In any case, Farnese, until we deal with the betrayer, do not thoughtlessly face against Elizabeth. Even if you meet her coincidentally on the front line, avoid her peacefully. Do you understand? Absolutely do not fight her. This is an order to absolutely not fight her.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“.”</p><p>“Oho? Look here. I see there is no response. Are you going against my order already just because you gave one speech well? If you have been given an order, then you should acknowledge it. What are you showing off for?”</p><p>“I understand, Lord. I heard you well.”</p><p>Farnese pouted. It seems she fairly wanted to kill the Imperial Princess Elizabeth. I could not help but laugh. What a cute child.</p><p>Of course, it was not something that I was incapable of understanding. Before I fell into this world, I considered my father to be my archenemy and would constantly wish I could take his life a day sooner. With my index finger and thumb, I grabbed Farnese’s cheek and pulled on it.</p><p>“Sheesh, this repulsive thing. I live because of you, because of you.”</p><p>“Uuuu, guh.”</p><p>Farnese wriggled her arms.</p><p>“Let go, Lord. Generally, Your Lordship touches this young lady’s body without much thought too much. Please show some manners when interacting with a lady.”</p><p>“You may talk about being a lady once you have actually become one first. At the very least, I will consider changing my attitude towards you once your chest has become a bit bigger.”</p><p>“If Your Lordship is going to quibble over the smallness of chests, then is there not that much of a difference between Miss Lapis and this young lady?”</p><p>“Lapis is an exception.”</p><p>I coolly discarded her argument.</p><p>“Regardless of the situation, Lapis has the authority to acquire such a special exception. If you have any complaints, then go and become as smart and as pretty as Lapis, you gum scab. Of course, even if a hundred years flow by, it is most likely impossible for you to achieve such a feat.”</p><p>“Your Lordship really favors Miss Lapis.”</p><p>“Is it not obvious when she is the sole person with the same heart as I?”</p><p>Lapis is my love.</p><p>Lapis is my sun.</p><p>No matter what anyone says, this was an evident truth that was as clear as the law of physics.</p><p>Like that, we, lord and vassal, came down from the boulder while taunting one another. At the bottom of the boulder, including Barbatos, Paimon, and the other Demon Lords who were commanders of an army corps, there were around 30 Demon Lords waiting for us. Since the speech from our side and the enemy side was over, the only thing that really remained now was war.</p><p>Among them, Barbatos was leaning back on a chair and waving her hand.</p><p>“Hey, self-proclaimed Mister Genius. Good job.”</p><p>“All I have done is carry out the sacred task.”</p><p>I bowed. Although in private, Barbatos and I were sex friends who spoke informally to one another, we were currently in the presence of others. Furthermore, we were within a military where the regulation of command and discipline was stern. It was obvious that I, who was rank 71st, would speak formally to Barbatos, who was rank 8th.</p><p>That was fine. Something like our relationship falling apart because I talked formally could not possibly happen. It was not simply because we had a friendly relationship when in private, but because Barbatos and I were allied politically. We have been allied until now, and we will most likely continue to be so for a while longer. Until we have defeated our joint enemy, Demon Lord Paimon, our trust was firm. It was fine to be certain of this.</p><p>“Sacred task. Sacred task, is it?”</p><p>Barbatos smirked and crossed her white legs.</p><p>“That’s right. We gave you a sacred task, didn’t we? Dantalian, we passed onto you, the kid who was still lingering at the very bottom of the ranks of Demon Lords, the right to give the opening speech of the Crescent Alliance that was joining together for the first time in no less than 200 years. Not to anyone else, we gave it to you while considering your contributions to our army during this war.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>I stopped walking.</p><p>Barbatos was all smiles like usual. However, the atmosphere emanating from the Demon Lords of the Plains Faction, who were standing around her, was threatening. I instinctively made Farnese stand behind me.</p><p>The air felt menacing.</p><p>To be exact, Barbatos’ eyes did.</p><p>A rage which even laughter could not hide was lingering in her eyes.</p><p>“Huh? Why are you hiding her? Let’s see her face. You gave to her the right of speech which we specifically gifted to you, right? On your own discretion, without consulting us. I wanted to see how great of a girl she is since she was able to make our Mr. Dantalian give all of his guts and organs to her.”</p><p>“Miss Barbatos.”</p><p>“Her Excellency, Barbatos.”</p><p>She spoke coldly.</p><p>“Add ‘Her Excellency’, you dimwit.”</p><p>Barbatos’ pupils were cold. I couldn’t find even a single ounce of affection towards me within her gaze. The temperature of one’s eyes is the same as their heart, was it? If those words were true, then this was most likely Barbatos’ true temper.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“I’m one of the corps commanders that leads the Crescent Alliance of a hundred thousand soldiers. What? Did you look down on me since I slept with you all the time?”</p><p>“.”</p><p>“Did you think you could do whatever you wanted from now on just because you saved my troops when they were in danger once? Oh dear, Dantalian. You did quite the good job for sending out a human child as the representative of us demons. Did you think I’d praise you like this?”</p><p>Barbatos’ smile thickened.</p><p>“Dig out your ear holes and listen well, Dantalian, since I’m going to be naming off the crimes you’ve committed thanks to this single speech of yours. First, since you put forward some kid, who’s still wet behind the ears, as the substitute of us great demons, that’s racial treason.”</p><p>Barbatos raised her middle finger on her left hand.</p><p>“Since you had the gall to make a mess out of our military discipline when war is going to be upon us soon, that’s insubordination while also in the presence of the enemy. Since it wasn’t you alone who bullshitted, but you had worked together with the witches, who you appointed as your royal guards, to concoct the speech, that’s group mutiny.”</p><p>Following her ring finger on her left hand, Barbatos raised her middle finger on her right hand, as well.</p><p>“Since the Demon Lord, who’s on the lowest seat of the army, dared to informally commit lese majesty on the field of battle where the 12 holy gods will be watching over us, you’ve even committed blasphemy. Wow, Dantalian. Look at this. How many is this? Even if you only count the number of lese majesties, there’s four. Even if we sever your neck, we’d have to do it 4 times. That’s a rather crappy feeling, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Your Excellency, Barbatos.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know. The fact that you see this military as a playground where you can dick around however you want. Since I overindulged you all the time, nothing illuminates in my eye sockets now. Nonetheless, you fucker, life isn’t that easy.”</p><p>I wasn’t given even a single opportunity to give an excuse.</p><p>Barbatos snapped her finger.</p><p>“Grab that bastard.”</p><p>And the shadow moved.</p><p>Ο</p><p><img src=\"file:///C:/Users/ANNGAN~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.png\" alt=\"25x25\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\"></p><p>Ο</p><p>It was similar to that of a beast’s mouth.</p><p>A pitch black liquid shot forth from Barbatos’ shadow, the dark mass then bared its fangs and rushed towards me. Each and every one of its numerous teeth was as thick as a person’s forearm. Gyaaaaaak⎯⎯⎯⎯the air screamed as it was torn. It was instantaneous. The beast of shadow grew in mass like a tsunami and it felt as if it were going to swallow me whole soon.</p><p>“!?”</p><p>I wonder if my brain perceived that I was in danger. My surroundings started to move at a speed clearly slower than normal. Somewhere. I had to move somewhere and avoid it. Even if I were uncertain about what kind of liquid that black tsunami was made from, it was evident that it was not something as adorable as H20.</p><p>Up down left right. My eyes searched for a side where the shadow had even the slightest bit of less mass. It was at the moment I was about to escape to my right, I ended up realizing a single fact.</p><p>Farnese.</p><p>Farnese was standing behind me.</p><p>If I move from my position, then the shadow will promptly swallow her.</p><p>My head heated up and tried to distinguish my priorities. My safety or Farnese’s safety. My consciousness determined which one had the higher priority.</p><p>‘Abandon her.’</p><p>The very edge of my consciousness announced. I was more important than Farnese. There was no value in even considering this. However, a more elaborate and complex judgment refuted a step late.</p><p>‘Do the complete opposite. Protect Farnese and cover her.’</p><p>‘Nonsense.’</p><p>‘There’s no way that Barbatos would kill me abruptly. There’s no merit for Barbatos to do so. At most, all she’d do is injure me. But Farnese was different. In Barbatos’ position, it didn’t matter whether she killed Farnese as much as she wanted to or not. Therefore, Farnese will die if you move away right now.’</p><p>‘And?’</p><p>‘And.’</p><p>Ο</p><p>And Farnese is Lapis and my child.</p><p>Ο</p><p>“.”</p><p>End of judgment.</p><p>There were no more arguments. At that point, my consciousness ended the calculations there.</p><p>I stopped my movement that was about to make my body dodge to the right. As my realization was a bit late, my body moved as hastily as it was delayed. I turned around just like that and embraced Farnese. Since I hugged Farnese with my entire body, I was able to barely cover her completely. The small Farnese squirmed within my embrace.</p><p>“Lo.”</p><p>Before she could even finish saying ‘Lord’.</p><p>I could sense the shadow of the beast sweeping over us in the air. With the breath, which Farnese let out, as the final trigger, our surroundings had returned to its normal pace. Now the method to dodge the attack was gone.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>It couldn’t be helped. Whenever danger approached, I was someone who acted according to his priorities. I have been like this since a young age.</p><p>What can I do? I can only hope that Barbatos will go a bit easy on me. I hugged Farnese tighter and closed my eyes.</p><p>⎯⎯⎯In that instant, something similar to a breeze brushed against my cheek.</p><p>It seemed as if the shadow of the beast, that was going to enshroud us soon, had stopped somewhere in mid-air, and there were no more signs of something else approaching us. When I cautiously raised my gaze, I could see 7 black mantles swaying before me.</p><p>7 cone hats.</p><p>7 staves.</p><p>“Ahahah.”</p><p>My royal guards.</p><p>The Berbere Sisters.</p><p>“You can’t do that, you can’t do that. It’d be troubling for the likes of us if our one and only master were to be injuuured.”</p><p>The group of witches, whom Humbaba was the head of, were raising their staves and fluttering the black mantles which I had gifted to them a while back.</p><p>The shadow beast was blocked by the staves and could not approach any further. It merely squirmed around creepily and was doing whatever it could to find another path by wriggling here and there. Every time it did so, the witches changed the direction of their staves slightly and obstructed the beast.</p><p>Grrrurrrg, grrrk⎯⎯⎯⎯a frustrated snarl flowed out from the beast’s maw. Without being fazed by it, Humbaba laughed.</p><p>“What’s this? Agilis’ demon? Ahahah? This is really an ancient familiar. I think it’s been around 300 years since I’ve last seen one. Should I say that’s indeed Her Highness Barbatos for you? It’s not only high-toned for the likes of us but since even the familiar’s grub is extraordinary as well, respect forms naturally in low people like us.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>Barbatos furrowed her brow.</p><p>“These girls. How dare you not know your place and.”</p><p>“Yeess, we interfered while not knowing our place. We apologiiize. Although the likes of us are the lowest of the low, we have a fatal disease where we’ll die if we’re unable to protect His Highness, Dantalian. By nature, this is a bullshit-like incurable disease, but weren’t the likes of us already infamous for being similar to bullshit? We hope that a greater being, such as Your Highness, is able to understand magnanimously.”</p><p>Humbaba laughed. The moment she did so, the other witches giggled as well.</p><p>As the confrontation lasted longer, more witches affiliated to my army started to gather slowly. Before I knew it, my Royal Guard of 20 witches was surrounding me without leaving a single gap.</p><p>“Ah, referentially, although the young ones these days are completely in the dark, us lowly ones know how to dispose of things like this, you know? Although we can eradicate it immediately, we’re ooonly waiting patiently because of our respect towards Your Highness.”</p><p>Grrrrk the shadow beast whimpered. Some sort of black liquid was dropping onto the ground.</p><p>The beast had shrunk down until it was unable to budge an inch and quivered as if it were asking its master what it should do now.</p><p>“Tsk.”</p><p>Barbatos clicked her tongue. The moment she snapped her fingers, the beast fell apart instantly. The black liquid seeped into the earth and disappeared like that.</p><p>“I left these things, which I should have killed before, alive because the sight of them groveling around was pitiful. It’s impressive, Dantalian. Seriously impressive. Really, when you go insane it seems you go completely nuts as a group.”</p><p>Barbatos spat on the ground.</p><p>“Just how did you sweet-talk those decomposed maggots of souls to be able to make them as docile as pets? Hm? Your fiancée is a half-blood, your acting general is a human bitch, and your royal guards are witches, right? Looking at the medals attached to their heads, they’re all Quadriphyllouses, as well? Wow. You’re having all sorts of fun. You, do you know how many times those bitches had have to spread their asses for Demon Lords in order to get a Quadriphyllous? Fuuuck. Oi, those bitches’ assholes are so worn out that I can hear them flapping loosely from here.”</p><p>Humbaba bobbed her head in agreement.</p><p>“Ahah. Her Majesty’s graceful words are quite right, master. In truth, we’re sad that we rank second in the demon continent for having loose rears. However, do not worry! We’ve vowed that, from this year forth, and until the day we die, we’ll spread our bottom holes for our master and our master only, after all! This is something to be slightly moved by.”</p><p>Barbatos grit her teeth.</p><p>“Damn witches. Since those bitches are so fucking perverted, they receive no damage even if you swear at them.”</p><p>Mm.</p><p>That’s something I keenly agreed to.</p><p>I let out a sigh and spoke to Humbaba.</p><p>“Thank you. It seems I am in debt to you now.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Ahah, what kind of debt is that supposed to be? Royal guards are something you have appointed in order to use them in times like this. But, if Your Highness really does feel grateful towards us, then please bestow upon us Your Highness’ royal grace later today.”</p><p>These girls don’t change even in a situation like this.</p><p>Now then, I was able to get past the immediate crisis for now. What should I do from this point on? First, there was a need to find out why Barbatos was behaving so aggressively.</p><p>Ravens flew around and then perched on top of the witches’ hats and staves. The birds cawed. As witches were peasants so they could not dare make any complaints towards Barbatos, it felt as if the ravens were rebelling against Barbatos in their stead. Furthermore, the witches, whose bodies were completely concealed by their black mantles, appeared as if they were one in body and soul with the ravens. Over the cone hats and ravens, Barbatos shouted loudly.</p><p>“Hey, Dantalian! Are you really going to do this to me? Huh? Are we going to fucking slap each other and break up like this? Just counting the crimes you’ve committed now, fuck, racial treason, insubordination before the enemy, group mutiny, and even heresy! No one can complain if I rip your head off and check the color of your intestines right now! Offer that human girl over there to us and end it obediently while I’m still asking nicely!”</p><p>“.”</p><p>Was that it?</p><p>I understood why Barbatos was behaving ruder than necessary. By making Farnese bear the responsibilities excessively, Barbatos wanted to lessen the total amount of blame that came around to me. In Barbatos’ perspective, she was doing that for my sake. This was Barbatos’ own way of showing consideration, so to speak.</p><p>However.</p><p>“My apologies, Your Excellency, Barbatos.”</p><p>I lowered my head.</p><p>I appreciate your sentiment, but I have to refuse.</p><p>“Even if this child is a part of the human race, she is a child that I have decided to raise and she is a vassal that I am responsible for. As I was the one to have appointed this child as my acting general, I am also the one to have sent her out to give the speech. If General Farnese made a mistake, then that is my mistake, and if there is something which General Farnese must take responsibility for, then it is a weight that solely I must bear.”</p><p>“Lord.”</p><p>Farnese, who was being held within my arms, was looking straight up at me. I wonder if she was worried. I was so taken aback that I almost snorted out loud.</p><p>My father and I were different.</p><p>I didn’t shoulder people if I were incapable of taking responsibility for them from the start, and if I did take them in, then I would make sure to bear the burden until the very end.</p><p>Of course, if I take all of the blame instead of Farnese, then there will be a slight set back in my plan to remove Paimon. Nevertheless, I am an outstanding genius. I have a plan. I also have a card up my sleeve. If anything, a small obstacle will only make it more enjoyable for me.</p><p>With my right arm, I patted Farnese’s back. You are much too young to be worrying about my safety, kid. If you are a child, then behave like one and obediently be protected by an adult.</p><p>“.”</p><p>Farnese nodded her head slightly. She slowly rested her head against my chest. Even if we were not connected by blood or something else, the daughter that Lapis and I had decided to shoulder together depended on me like that.</p><p>That sight most likely displeased her. Barbatos spat out sharply.</p><p>“Haa, so what? Are you going to wriggle away like a serpent, without bearing any responsibility whatsoever, even though you went against military discipline right before my eyes? Why don’t you just piss in my eyes instead, Dantalian? Since I don’t want to witness military discipline falling apart even if I die.”</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>“Even I know well how much emphasis Your Excellency puts on military regulations. I do not have the slightest intention to do something like avoiding my responsibility. I shall shoulder General Farnese’s wrongdoings as well. Your Excellency, please execute me.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I have requested for my own execution.”</p><p>I calmly looked around my surroundings. The atmosphere of the surrounding was rigid. For some reason, it seems Paimon was looking this way with a face that appeared as if she were concerned about something. Without immediately contemplating on what the meaning behind that expression was, I declared.</p><p>“Rank 71st, Demon Lord Dantalian. I shall renounce my authority as a Demon Lord and put myself on military trial here.”</p><p>Ο</p><p><strong>▯Demon Lord of Benevolence, Rank 9th, Paimon</strong></p><p><strong> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 3</strong></p><p><strong> Bruno Plains, Army of the Crescent Alliance</strong></p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ο</p><p>“Rank 71st, Demon Lord Dantalian. I shall renounce my authority as a Demon Lord and put myself on military trial here.”</p><p>The moment Dantalian uttered those words, the surrounding froze. It was the same for this lady as well. To request for one’s own execution through military trial, this is unprecedented. This. This, goes beyond bounds.</p><p>Barbatos gazed at Dantalian abstractedly.</p><p>“A lord’s words are heavy. Words once spoken can never be taken back, Dantalian. This is a word of advice as your intimate friend and senior. I’m giving you a chance to change the words you said just now for the last time.”</p><p>“My sincerest apologies, Your Excellency, but I do not intend to alter my words. General Farnese is a child that this one loves. I would rather die than pass onto this child the burden.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>Barbatos’ face became void of emotions.</p><p>Originally, in order to punish a Demon Lord, the confirmation of the crime and the severity of the punishment must be formally decided during a Walpurgis Night. In other words, a Demon Lord can only be punished during a Walpurgis Night. As every Demon Lord has the authority to refuse any other type of trial, this was one of the Demon Lords’ privileges. If this were not the case, then there was the danger of high ranking Demon Lords using the pretext of war to purge lower ranking Demon Lords during a military trial.</p><p>However, Dantalian had renounced his authority as a Demon Lord just now. That means he has fallen into a status where he is legally capable of being submitted to a military trial.</p><p>Racial treason, insubordination in the face of the enemy, group mutiny, and blasphemy, these were the names of the offenses that Dantalian had committed now each and every one of these were grave crimes. Among those, a normal soldier would be executed if they committed even one. But to have committed 4 lese majesties. In the case that the military trial is carried out just like this, then Dantalian cannot avoid his execution.</p><p>“I definitely gave you the opportunity. Several times, at that.”</p><p>“And I have expressed myself clearly, Your Excellency.”</p><p>“You have no regrets, right?”</p><p>“Yes, that is correct. I am, at all times, only concerned about Your Excellency, Barbatos’ safety and honor.”</p><p>“Haaa.”</p><p>Barbatos let out a sigh. Even she clearly knew what the results would be if a military trial were to be held. Because she knew so, she most likely intended to cover up this incident by merely whipping Dantalian a bit.</p><p>Even that seemed to have weighed upon Barbatos’ mind since she was about to go as far as to make that human girl take the majority of the responsibility instead of Dantalian. The minimum amount of blame to Dantalian. A punishment that is nothing more than mere formality would have fallen upon him. Even Dantalian should not be unaware of this. So why?</p><p>“Okay. Let’s open it, a military trial or whatever. As it happens, all the corps commanders are here as well. Isn’t that great? I, Barbatos, as the rank 8th and the leader of the Plains Faction, as the one who boasts immortality, shall hold Demon Lord Dantalian’s court martial.”</p><p>The ones in charge of military trials are usually the highest ranking person in one’s corps.</p><p>Since Dantalian is not affiliated with any other Demon Lords and had autonomously hired a troop of mercenaries, in this situation, the highest ranking person responsible for his corps are the military commanders. Thus, Barbatos, Marbas, and this lady. Just in time, everyone was gathered here before the outbreak of war.</p><p>“Old man Marbas. Voice your intention to participate in the trial.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>The magnate of the Neutral Faction and the commander of the second army. Rank 5th, Demon Lord Marbas nodded his head slowly.</p><p>“I acknowledge my participation in this trial.”</p><p>His expression was mixed. That man has a debt towards Dantalian.</p><p>Due to the loss of Marbas’ previous battle, there was a high possibility that the expedition of the Crescent Alliance itself would have broken down in failure in that moment. No, if Dantalian had not acquired victory, then without a doubt the expedition would have failed. He was feeling a millstone around his neck because of that.</p><p>If possible, he would have covered up Dantalian’s crimes a military trial was no good. This was something that was directly connected with morale. There was absolutely no significance in a military trial that pardoned high treason. For Marbas, who puts so much emphasis on legislations and regulations, it would be nearly impossible for him to raise Dantalian’s hand during a trial. No matter how much he tries, the best he could possibly do is throw in a blank ballot.</p><p>And.</p><p>That, is the same for this lady, as well.</p><p>Regardless of whether Dantalian is the first person this lady has ever met in her life with the same ideology as her, regardless of whether it is this lady’s first time meeting someone who has the same mentality as her, kept in their bosom, this lady is currently the commander of an army of 30,000. This lady is standing in a position where she must worry about the morale of 30,000 officers and men. Something like throwing in a dissenting vote while other people are watching, this lady cannot do such a thing.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Because this lady is a person in charge.</p><p>Because that is the duty of a commander who leads an army.</p><p>“.”</p><p>What does this lady have to do?</p><p>What does this lady have to do in order to naturally get past the military trial without having to give a dissenting vote?</p><p>If it were not a military trial, then preserving Dantalian’s life is possible. In the end, every issue is settled through a vote during a Walpurgis Night. In other words, it was purely a fight of numbers.</p><p>As the head of the Mountain Faction, this lady can move 20 votes. If Barbatos were to utilize the 15 votes from the Plains Faction here, then even with that, this lady already has the majority. That is right. If it were not a military trial. If we can just pass this moment.</p><p>“Oi, whore. Voice your intention to participate in the trial.”</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>“What? Are you ignoring me right now? Whore. Hello? Miss Whore whose mind is vast because her hole is ragged. Bitch, despite your looks you’re still an army commander, you know? If you’re aware then say that you’ll participate in.”</p><p>Okay.</p><p>If it is this, then it might be possible.</p><p>Although it is dangerous. Although it is an incomparably-dangerous gamble.</p><p>If it is this lady, then she can do it.</p><p>Since jumping into a gamble is this lady’s specialty.</p><p>This lady straightened her mind and raised her feather fan to hide her lips. The posture that this lady always assumes. By covering half of the face, only half of this lady is revealed. This is the most comfortable.</p><p>This lady spoke while staring at Barbatos.</p><p>Ο</p><p>“No. This lady will not voice her participation.”</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯⎯A stillness fell over the surrounding.</p><p>Starting from Barbatos, all of the Demon Lords gazed at this lady as if they were wondering whether they had heard wrong just now.</p><p>It was obvious. Until now, Dantalian and this lady had established an opposing relationship with one another for every single action we took. It may not be the case for Barbatos or Marbas, but everyone most likely never expected that this lady would be the one to exercise her veto.</p><p>That was exactly the reason.</p><p>Compared to the others, since this lady was a political rival who stood out the most when trying to get rid of Dantalian, that was why this plan, which this lady had thought up of, was valid.</p><p>“Fuck, what is it now? Hey, did all of you guys get high today just so you could play a joke on me? The bastard known as my lover fucked up on his own and is now requesting for his own court martial, and now that whore over there is refusing for some fucking reason. Did you two go off somewhere and fuck while I wasn’t watching?”</p><p>“Please do not assume that everyone in the world is as vulgar as you. Of course, if they are born lacking the same amount of intelligence like you did, then there is nothing else that can be said.”</p><p>This lady showed a thin smile. A vein popped in Barbatos’ forehead, but that did not matter. I taunted her on purpose, after all.</p><p>“This lady has told you before, have I not? Barbatos, that man is no longer your toy and is now mine. This lady has the plan to pull Dantalian into the Mountain Faction. There is no way that this lady would agree to such a trial when that is the case.”</p><p>“Aaang?”</p><p>“Be it a military trial or something else, do it yourself. However, do you know this, Barbatos? Although Dantalian sending out a human girl as a substitute is certainly a lese majesty, you are the one who had selected that Dantalian to be the orator of our Crescent Alliance.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>Barbatos’ face instantly became cold.</p><p>“So what? What are you trying to babble?”</p><p>“Who knows? This lady is simply curious. Since you are the one to have put forward Dantalian, who is nothing more than rank 71st, surely could something like you instructing him on what to say not have happened?”</p><p>This lady smiled.</p><p>The more this lady mixed a hint of coquette laughter into her voice, the colder the surrounding mood became. A couple of people at a time, the other Demon Lords should have begun to catch on to what this lady meant by those words.</p><p>“Barbatos, this lady has suspicions. If Dantalian had committed a mistake, then in the first place, is that not your responsibility? You pushed Dantalian forward as the war negotiator, and you were the one who selected Dantalian to be the orator. If perhaps, Dantalian had made a mistake merely because he was thoughtless, then it is your responsibility for not having realized Dantalian’s incompetence. Moreover, if perhaps, Dantalian had made a mistake on purpose.”</p><p>Yes.</p><p>That is right.</p><p>“Then are you not the criminal who had committed the lese majesty?”</p><p>Attack Barbatos instead of Dantalian.</p><p>This was this lady’s stratagem.</p><p>A complete silence swept over the surroundings now. No one dared to open their mouths rashly. People were looking this way with their faces dyed with shock.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Just now, what this lady had done was no different to having made a declaration of war towards Barbatos who was a fellow army commander. Although all this lady has done is raise a suspicion, it is that suspicion that can end one’s life in politics.</p><p>Barbatos stared at this lady for a long time without uttering a single word. There was no hostility or rage. Only a tranquil sneer was permeating through her.</p><p>“Hmm. I did find it strange when a bitch like you suddenly wanted to take Dantalian away from me. I assumed that you were acting on impulse while leaving yourself to those stupid thoughts of yours again, but surely. You’re really trying to start an all-or-nothing battle with me during this war?”</p><p>“Oh dear. That is an exaggerated interpretation, Barbatos. The only thing this lady has said is that she was curious. You appointed Dantalian as the orator, and then you attacked him immediately after the actual speech was over? No matter how you look at it, it is not a fair treatment.”</p><p>“What? Do you think I sent Dantalian to give the speech on purpose just so I could get rid of him after? You should just accuse me of having incited everything from start to finish while you’re at it.”</p><p>“Who knows? This lady has never said anything with certainty. This lady simply wishes to voice her objection towards handling this military trial with more haste than caution. There is the possibility that Dantalian may become an important witness, after all. Yes, and if possible, while also pulling him into this lady’s faction.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>A moment of silence.</p><p>“Aha, puhahah—, puhahahahah—!”</p><p>Barbatos suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p>People were taken aback and glanced at one another. Although she was facing a declaration of war, far from being enraged, she was laughing her head off. To them, this is most likely a bewildering sight.</p><p>However, this lady knows. Barbatos has always been that kind of woman. A personage who struck fear into people by not laughing when she should, and laughing when she should not.</p><p>Barbatos laughed to the point where tears formed in the corner of her eyes.</p><p>“Yeah, mhm. That’s right. You’re that sort of bitch, Paimon. You were always a sly bitch. You go around pretending to be a goody two-shoes and pick on things that are the size of a rat’s tail. Last time, you put forward your suspicion that I created the Black Death, and now you’re really suggesting that I instigated racial treason? Iyaaaah. Bitches like you are really fucking impressive bitches. Me! Yeah, I admit it! I admit it! The fact that you’re quite the motherfucker, Paimon!”</p><p>“.”</p><p>“Then fuck, what do you want to do? As you can see, the military trial is out of the question now. Should we call over those Demon Lords who’re shitting about in the back, hmm? Want to just hold a Walpurgis Night here? Whether it’d be appropriate if I die or not since I committed high treason? Or should I just shoulder the suspicion and be like, Oh, Miss Paimon, something like that never happened, let us figure this out later, and explain it to you like this?”</p><p>Barbatos spat on the floor.</p><p>“Ha, you fucker. You shitty fucking whore. You’re really doing a good job when the enemy is right in front of us. This Crescent Alliance expedition is over as well, it’s over. In any case, you’re a bitch whose one ability to screw up an entire household is just baffling.”</p><p>The Demon Lords affiliated to the Plains Faction were standing in a line past Barbatos. They were all letting out a murderous intent while glaring in this direction. It was the same for this side as well, this lady’s comrades were going against that murderous intent with their snarling intimidation. With this, the Crescent Alliance instantly split into two sides. The Demon Lords of the Neutral Faction were trying their best to calm everyone down, but this was beyond their capabilities.</p><p>Amidst the army that was swept in chaos.</p><p>“.”</p><p>Dantalian was standing and gazing at this lady.</p><p>His eyes were as pitch black as the bottom of a well. It was difficult for this lady to guess what thoughts and emotions lingered underneath those eyes. It felt as if he were contemplating something or trying to measure this lady’s intentions. Towards that Dantalian, Barbatos spoke.</p><p>“Dantalian.”</p><p>“Yes, Your Excellency.”</p><p>“I’m suspending your trial for an indefinite period of time. I’ll prepare a prison cell, so stay there. We’ll discuss your crimes properly once the situation has settled down.”</p><p>Dantalian nodded his head.</p><p>“Understood. However, excluding myself, I request that you are tolerant towards the rest of my vassals. Throughout the winter, my vassals recruited mercenaries and were remarkably able to build up a force of 7,000. They will without a doubt not be useless when fighting in a battle against the humans.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Yeah, yeah. Do what you want.”</p><p>Barbatos then led her Plains Faction group down the rocky hill. From this point on, the Plains Faction will break away from the united front and conduct war unilaterally. Barbatos’ action had implicitly displayed such intentions.</p><p>Marbas let out a sigh.</p><p>“Are we going to be torn apart before the war has even begun? Oh, Paimon. Is this truly the meaning of your goal? I am starting to slowly understand you less.”</p><p>“Marbas.”</p><p>“I shall be the one to undertake Dantalian’s supervision. With what has unfolded just now, I cannot trust you and Barbatos to manage the new inductee. It would be good if the surveillance of the prison is done by a different faction each day. Nonetheless, if this Crescent Alliance fails as well, then how many times would that make it?”</p><p>Marbas gently stared out into an empty space. For a moment, this lady’s heart felt numb because of the veteran’s eyes which were filled with melancholy.</p><p>Marbas most likely came out on this expedition with the sincere intention of succeeding this Crescent Alliance. Even if it were an unavoidable choice, this lady had ignored Marbas’ intent. This lady’s head fell down on its own.</p><p>Without leaving any more words, Marbas left while leading the Neutral Faction. The only ones left on the hill now were the members of the Mountain Faction, including this lady. The child, who has one of the highest ranks in the Mountain Faction, second to this lady, Sitri, approached and spoke out. Sitri had a face filled with excitement.</p><p>“Big Sis Paimon, you were amazing! Iyaah. Those Plains Faction bastards. The sight of them glaring at us because of your sudden attack was well worth seeing. At any rate, those guys, who only have shit in their heads, were trying to pretend that they were on a high horse!”</p><p>“.”</p><p>It was not only Sitri. This lady’s other Mountain Faction comrades were showing a similar response. How satisfying, that’s Her Highness Paimon for you, I didn’t think she’d refute like that there. Without getting bored, the praises towards this lady did not stop and continued on.</p><p>Our Mountain Faction’s base was quite some distance away from the war and was in the vicinity of mountains and coastlines. Even if the expedition of the Crescent Alliance were to fail, we will not receive damage that is as severe as what the Plains Faction or the Neutral Faction would receive, so their attitude towards war was somewhat carefree, as well. Even if this one fails, there is always next time. That mental attitude was being displayed out in the open.</p><p>This lady does not believe that is wrong. Every war immensely wastes manpower and wealth, after all. If possible, resolving the issue through diplomacy is the best. That is why this lady had negotiated with the Empire in secret until now and had prepared different operations in the background.</p><p>However, for some reason.</p><p>Barbatos’ insane laughter and the sound of Marbas’ drawn out sigh, for some reason, these sounds stuck to this lady’s ears and refused to fall off.</p><p>As if trying to shake off something that refused to vanish, this lady turned her gaze towards the human army across the plain. A countless number of flags were waving in that place and were enduring the wind of the season that was approaching us, in advance. War will most likely erupt momentarily.</p><p>“.”</p><p>The 4th month and 3rd day.</p><p>Winter folds away and Spring blooms anew.</p><p>This lady could only close her eyes before the sight of our people trying to vomit blood during this blindness of history, even though the flowers were all respectively emanating a fragrance while in full bloom. This lady wishes to keep her eyes closed like this forever. Even emotions like this dwelled in the corners of this lady’s mind.</p><p>“Big Sis Paimon, why aren’t we going anywhere yet? We should prepare for war.”</p><p>However, there is a voice that pulls this lady.</p><p>Once this lady opened her eyes, there were Demon Lords, who were solely waiting for this lady’s orders, lined up before her. As this lady was in the position where she must naturally move, this lady nodded.</p><p>“Yes. Sitri, and everyone else, return to our military camp and order our soldiers to get into battle formation. Sitri, please stand as our vanguard. This lady shall be the center and follow you.”</p><p>“Okay. Leave the front lines to me, sis! Ever since I was born, the only thing I knew how to do is fight, after all!”</p><p>With an ‘Ehehe’, Sitri laughed innocently. It was difficult to see that as a face of a general who was about to jump into battle soon. But this was most likely Sitri’s innocence.</p><p>That is okay. If you all continue to show only this innocent appearance, then this lady can continue to smile. This lady can walk. Even if it is a war that you did not hope for, this lady shall do what she can to obtain victory.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Everyone. Order the flag bearers to raise their flags. Blow the horns. It is time to advance.”</p><p>“Yes, Your Excellency, Commander!”</p><p>All of the Mountain Faction present here responded together.</p><p>We most likely should not assault the unit led by the Imperial Princess Elizabeth. That is an entrance to Hell. The weakest army in the Human Alliance, also known as the Crusaders, is probably the imperial army of Francia Although the Republic of Batavia is also famous for being the weakest in open warfare yes. Obviously, we must aim for the imperial army here.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ Buuuuuu.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Before we knew it, the sound of horns being blown could be heard. They were the sound of the Plains Faction horns. It seems Barbatos has started to move. Seeing the direction of their advance they are heading exactly towards the imperial army of Habsburg that is being commanded by the Imperial Princess Elizabeth. How pitiful.</p><p>“Sis, preparations are complete! You just have to give the order now!”</p><p>Sitri ran over like a dog and gazed at this lady.</p><p>“Where should we go? Which humans should we end first? Habsburg? Francia? Brittany? The Polish-Lithuanian? Or should we sweep them up all at once?”</p><p>“No. We shall exterminate the imperial army of Francia first.”</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>Sitri brought the knuckles of her fists together with an audible thud. Even with just that, the air was pushed back such that this lady had nearly dropped her fan. Although this child is simple, she has a flaw in the fact that she behaves rashly.</p><p>Now then.</p><p>There is no time to hesitate. Although this was a war that this lady had not started and was a war that this lady originally did not intend to participate in, in any case, this lady was standing in a position very close to war. Fortunately, craving for peace but not holding war in contempt is what this lady’s army is. Something like the troops of Francia, who are smitten by a disease, we can crush them with ease.</p><p>This lady raised the end of her feather fan and pointed towards the direction where we must go.</p><p>“Mountain Faction. Advance.”</p><p>Ο</p><p><strong>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian</strong></p><p><strong> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 3</strong></p><p><strong> Bruno Plains, Army of the Crescent Alliance</strong></p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯⎯⎯Everything was proceeding just as I had predicted.</p><p>Paimon was a depraved betrayer. I was certain that if I showed her an opening, then she would, without a doubt, take the opportunity. Sure enough, Paimon rushed at Barbatos like a coyote that had smelled blood.</p><p>Making me join the Mountain Faction was most likely nothing more than a pretext. Paimon’s true goal was Barbatos. By making my mistake into Barbatos’ fault, she was most likely scheming to make Barbatos fall from her position.</p><p>Earlier, while requesting for my military trial, I said this.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ I am at, all times, only concerned about Your Excellency, Barbatos’ safety and honor.</p><p>Ο</p><p>That was bait.</p><p>As if implying that a military trial was the only method to protect Barbatos. I purposely inferred that if I were executed, then the opportunity to make Barbatos take responsibility will disappear along with me. It was nothing more than a small implication, but it seems to Paimon, who was pondering about how to screw the Plains Faction over, she was able to hear it as clear as day.</p><p>Was this not splendid?</p><p>Paimon, although you are a traitor who had sold out your own kind, you are a traitor with an extraordinarily, peerless intellect. If betraying were a talent, then without a doubt Paimon was gifted with a first-class talent. This was something that I could do nothing else but acknowledge. Honestly, I want to give her a round of applause.</p><p>In the first place, in history, Paimon was originally a parasite-like being who betrayed the Demon Lord army and latched onto the hero.</p><p>In the game 〈Dungeon Attack〉, the hero encounters Paimon by chance while wandering around a frontier city. In that moment, Demon Lord Paimon fell for the hero at first glance and would appear before them constantly afterward.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ It is this lady’s first time meeting a man such as yourself.</p><p>⎯⎯ This lady shall bestow upon you the right to steal this lady’s lips, Mr. Self-entitled Hero.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Befitting her title of the Queen of Succubi, Paimon masterfully approached the hero. Although at that time, the hero had their heart stolen and had felt the emotion called love for the first time, in the end, they were unable to overcome the difference between races and Paimon died by the hero’s hands. Funny enough, even after her heart had been pierced by the hero’s cold sword, Paimon did not put away her emotion towards the hero.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ Demons and humans living together. This lady had started to dream of that possibility after meeting you. However, it cannot be helped, can it? Since dreams are similar to that of the fluttering of frail flower petals, this lady cannot blame you.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Ο</p><p>When your final moment arrived.</p><p>Paimon smiled while blood dripped down the side of her mouth.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ This is an already dying body. Could you not bestow upon this lady a final kiss?</p><p>Ο</p><p>As if she were casting a curse.</p><p>As if she were bestowing a blessing.</p><p>Should I call her a romanticist since she was able to achieve her love after having sacrificed her own life?</p><p>Although it would have been a relief if she had paid the penalty with only her life, Paimon was the head that led the greatest faction in the demon continent. Due to that, since the hero did not receive any particular threat from the demons, they were able to devote themself to solving the division within humanity. And the opposition that had to face the hero who was set free was none other than.</p><p>“That was a close call, Lord. In any case, this young lady is never bored whenever she watches Your Lordship from the side. Every now and then, there are days when this young lady believes that Your Lordship’s life may perhaps be just a big joke.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>That’s right.</p><p>It was this cheeky kid with no facial expressions.</p><p>The Imperial Princess Elizabeth, who led the Habsburg Empire, made the hero into her vanguard, and Queen Henrietta, who led the Kingdom of Brittany, appointed Farnese as a general. The two heroes of the century approached war in order to make their own nation gain supremacythis was a history that was supposed to unfold 15 years from now. Currently, as much as how I had appointed Farnese myself, it was a future that could absolutely never happen now.</p><p>“Furthermore, what was that earlier? Surely Your Lordship was not trying to save this young lady by sacrificing yourself, right? Honestly, this young lady can only say that it was a nuisance, Lord. This young lady would rather be murdered by a Demon Lord than be embraced by Your Lordship. Albeit this young lady judges Your Lordship’s intellect highly, this one has an incredibly objective standpoint when it comes to Your Lordship’s physique. In other words, Your Lordship’s body is a bit dreadful. Something that feels somewhat lacking when embraced by it, something that is so unsightly when allowing one’s body to be completely embraced by it, that it is difficult to find anything else that is as unseemly as this, it is that sort of physique. Therefore, if by chance, danger approaches this young lady, then do not needlessly feel inclined to show off, but instead leave this young lady and Ha-ah? Hoa⎯⎯ ah ah?”</p><p>I took Farnese’s hat off and pressed down on the crown of her head. This kid, just because she learned some volubility from Lapis, her cheekiness is really soaring through the roof now. This kind of punk deserved punishment by kneading.</p><p>Farnese trembled and swung both of her arms.</p><p>“Lord⎯⎯. Has this young lady not told you, did this young lady not tell you many times already? Uu, hoa. Not the crown. Somewhere else may be fine, but, aah Aaah the crown, at least not the croooown.”</p><p>“Just obediently melt, you rice cake.”</p><p>“Hauh, this young lady is melting. This young lady is becoming a puuulp.”</p><p>For this blonde haired child, who’s currently held in my arms and turning into a mush, to be destined to become a famous general, the archnemesis of the hero, and the calamity of humanity that approaches mankind. Although I was already aware, this world is quite rotten as well.</p><p>Shortly after, captains affiliated to the Neutral Faction came to escort me. I could not feel even an ounce of aggressiveness or ill-temperament towards me from them. They merely requested for me to accompany them while maintaining courtesy.</p><p>“Although humble, we have prepared the prison cell, Your Highness Dantalian. If perhaps, it is not a discourtesy, then.”</p><p>“What is there to be discourteous of? Guide me there. I shall follow obediently with the mentality of someone who has become a prisoner.”</p><p>The captains of the Neutral Faction bowed their heads.</p><p>Thereafter, there was literally a humble prison cell located in the place where I had followed the military captains to. Should I call it a prison? It was more similar to an iron cage that was used to contain animals. Only a bundle of straw was strewn about inside of the beast’s cage, there was truly no furniture or decorations.</p><p>After seeing the shabby state of the prison cell, Humbaba laughed.</p><p>“Ahahah? Is this some sort of fun joke? Or an unfunny joke? Surely you don’t intend to place our master inside a shabby shitcan like this, riiiiiight? Should we cast a curse that’ll make you have to live as a eunuch for the rest of your life? Should we zap zap you with a curse that’ll make it so you only feel things with your butts⎯⎯? I’m just asking out of curiooosity, but do you guys have a great interest in life without women, asceticism, like Buddhist monks?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“M-My apologies, but this is truly all we have at the moment.”</p><p>“I see that it’s your courtesy to tell people to politely eat shit since that’s all you have at the moment. Mhm. Uhum. I understand. But, by the way. At the moment, the only thing we can give you right now is a eunuch-curse, what do you think about this maaatter?”</p><p>The witches surrounded the captains while smiling brightly. Their faces were certainly laughing, but their gazes were savage. The one who becomes pitiful here was the one responsible. If it were an offense to convey the order of their superior when they had no imperium, then it was their offense.</p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p>“Humbaba, it is fine.”</p><p>“Ara. But, master.”</p><p>“Did I not say it was fine? I am being taken as a prisoner, anyway. By all means, would I bask in power after having gone into that small space? Would that place be luxurious just because I say that I am basking in luxury there? If a king were unable to behave as a king, then, at the very least, should a prisoner not behave as a prisoner?”</p><p>“No, that’s not it.”</p><p>Humbaba spoke with a very troubled face.</p><p>“At the very least, there needs to be a comfortable bed if the likes of us are going to go in there together with master and properly enjoy the relationship between man and woman, right? If we’re ordered to copulate on top of a pile of straw, then, of course, we can do it, but when you drag your back on the straw it stings a bit.”</p><p>The surrounding witches nodded their heads while saying, ‘Mhm’. It seems to be an atmosphere where they were agreeing enthusiastically to what Humbaba stated.</p><p>“.”</p><p>I quietly pulled on Humbaba’s cheek. The cheek of my dear leader of the Royal Guard stretched out like pizza cheese.</p><p>“Gehuhuhuh! Gahu, gyahuh!?”</p><p>Surely, even a witch’s way of groaning was out of the ordinary.</p><p>Without cutting her any slack, I pulled on Humbaba’s cheek to its limit. This fellow, I wonder if it was because she had lived her life being tortured for many days, but she doesn’t even bat an eyelash from normal pain.</p><p>“Stop dreaming. What do you mean by going in there with me? You will all immediately follow Farnese here and go to war. Listen well to Farnese and Lapis and come back after you have hunted down many humans.”</p><p>“How could that be.”</p><p>Humbaba had a face that looked as if the world was ending.</p><p>“Since master is in prison already, we wanted to enjoy confinement together.”</p><p>“Do not talk utter shit.”</p><p>“Ah. Or perhaps, instead of acting like prisoners, would us playing the role of prison guards be more appropriate to suit master’s preference? Don’t worry. Despite our looks, we’re completely proficient in both abuse and masochism. No matter how perverted master’s hobbies are, we’re reeeady to serve you sincerely!”</p><p>“Dear Lord. Now you are talking piss.”</p><p>Tsk tsk, I clicked my tongue.</p><p>In all seriousness, these fellows were a lost cause. Truly, I didn’t take them in and clothe them in vain.</p><p>“Farnese.”</p><p>“Mm. Do not worry, Lord. This young lady does not have any desire whatsoever to go to prison with Your Lordship. This young lady can only hope that Your Lordship obediently goes in prison by yourself and enjoys your life of imprisonment. If Your Lordship is gone, then would that now not make it so that Miss Lapis is the only one to abuse this young lady under the pretext of education? Mhm, how delightful. If possible, it would be great if Your Lordship goes in there and never comes out.”</p><p>Farnese nodded to herself.</p><p>“Rest assured, Lord. This young lady will give Your Lordship’s regards to Miss Lapis. Of course. This young lady is Your Lordships’ eternally loyal subject. This young lady can deal with this sort of trouble as much as it is required.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>This, in its own way, is incredibly annoying.</p><p>Why is it that my so-called vassals go from one extreme to another? Have beautiful concepts such as moderation and restraint not been inputted into their brains, at all? Just what sort of sin did I commit in my previous life that made me have to plan a general idea with this sort of people?</p><p>Without a doubt, there are most likely people with excellent talent and people well-informed in refinement standing by the Imperial Princess Elizabeth’s side. On the other hand, my acting general was a psychopathic insane person and the leader of my Royal Guard was a pervert, who was driven by lust and only had the color pink in her brain. The world was unfair.</p><p>“All right. What more could I hope from you fellows? Just, perform well during the war. Solely do war well. That is more than enough. Do not go somewhere and live while only taking a beating, okay? If they hit you once, then hit them back twice. I believe you will be able to do at least that much. Is that all right?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Farnese and Humbaba nodded their heads. In order, they went back after giving a response.</p><p>“Of course. If anything, this young lady plans to sever the necks of all the enemy and pile up a tower of bones. From tomorrow forth, just from hearing this young lady’s name the enemy will wet their trousers. Their urine will flow and flow until finally, the entire plain is covered by the liquid, making the stench reach Your Lordship’s prison, this young lady will earnestly hope for this. A rat tail’s amount of this young lady’s filial loyalty will perhaps be contained in there.”</p><p>“Even if it doesn’t reach, the likes of us will personally go and fill buckets of it and deliver them to you, master, so do not be concerned. Humble as we are, before vowing our fidelity to you, master, we made a living as couriers, after all. We’ve delivered excrements before, so something like urine is easy!”</p><p>“Since I have thoroughly understood how close your existences are to piss and shit, please go away already.”</p><p>Both Farnese and Humbaba saluted before departing.</p><p>Once those fellows were gone, the only people left were the Neutral Faction captains and myself. The captains were sneaking glances at me with eyes that appeared as if they were looking at an insane person. Although I considered making an excuse for myself, since it was clear that talking about it would just make me fall further into the pit, I had no other choice but to withstand the wretched feeling.</p><p>“Please confine me now.”</p><p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p><p>As if they were waiting for it, the captains quickly rushed forward and locked the iron gate. The initial courtesy that they displayed when they were first escorting me had clearly gone missing. I could explicitly sense that their faces were saying, ‘It’ll be a big problem if we don’t shove this perverted bastard in prison quickly’.</p><p>.</p><p>Yup. That was fine.</p><p>This was a strategy, after all.</p><p>By not sticking out in the eyes of the people and being remembered as an ungainly man, in order to pull the strings of the continent behind the curtain, it was a plan from beginning to end. It was true.  I am truly fine.</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ Clank.</p><p>Ο</p><p>The sound of metal resonated and the animal cage was shut.</p><p>As if I had become a single disconsolate beast, I gazed up towards the sky helplessly. The sky that had rained momentarily at dawn and was clear only a short while ago, was now dark again. Did the sky intend to supplement the earth, which will soon be covered in blood, with rain?</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ Uuuu.</p><p>⎯⎯ Buuuuu.</p><p>Ο</p><p>I could hear the sound of horns in the distance. It felt as if the horns were the sound of thunder falling from the dark clouds in the distant world over there. As thunder roared several times, they struck in places unrelated to me and those people over there fought one another while having nothing to do with me. Although it was a war that I had started, the war was far from me.</p><p>“.”</p><p>Drip.</p><p>All of a sudden, something fell from the ceiling of the iron cage.</p><p>It was cold.</p><p>I looked up towards the sky.</p><p>Between the gaps of the dark clouds, several drops of rain began to fall. The raindrops, which were closer to being scattered than they were descending, overlapped one another on their own until they soon grew into streaks of rain.</p><p>I believed the rain was similar to the streaks of blood that came from the fighting soldiers, who were planted here in this battlefield while their natural will had been ignored. The things that flowed here could not be helped. However, would it not be bitter to consider the things that were made to flow as something that also could not be helped?</p><p>Ο</p><p>⎯⎯ Woosh, shoooo.</p><p>Ο</p><p>I predicted that the history that I had started, had begun to flow like a storm alongside that rain. The war that will unfold over there was all mine. However, similar to the time displayed by the hour and minute hands of a clock and the separate time that was unraveled lengthily when music was performed⎯⎯⎯⎯the torrent and indifferent raindrops, that raged on the other side of the cage, merely fell here a single drop at a time. Indifferent to the time that was flowing over there, my time silently seeped into my body.</p><p>“.”</p><p>I took off my top and received the rainwater directly. Within my garments, there was a waist supporter and a pocket watch which I had brought with me beforehand. Among them, the pocket watch ticked lightly.</p><p>Barbatos, Paimon, Elizabeth, and Farnese will move around freely on that battlefield. However, when will they all realize that the time which had provided them with that space has always been solely mine? Who will be the first among them to approach me? The rain continued to flow and swept the dust off of my skin and took it down to the earth. The war was far, but that distant war was all mine.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I was here in this prison.</p><p>\"Oi. If you have an ear as well, then listen to what I have to say.\"</p><p>\"Though it actually feels as if people would only need an asshole if they wanted to listen to what you have to say. Occasionally, there are people who I believe it'd be a waste to use my ear holes on. Unfortunately, you're one of those people.\" </p><p>\"I heard it as well. They died again, right?\" </p><p>\"Laura De Farnese.\" </p><p>\"I've been hearing only that bitch's name lately.\"</p><p>\"There are only two types of people in war who have their names spread wide. Someone who kills the enemy well or someone who kills fellow comrades well. At the very least, it's a relief that there hasn't been anyone who became famous from killing their comrades yet.\"</p><p>\"The day before yesterday it was Brittany, today it was Batavia, and it may end up being Habsburg or Sardinia tomorrow. They say the scythe of the grim reaper doesn't discriminate people by borders or ask people what their nation is.\" </p><p>\"But they say she spares the people who surrender.\" </p><p>\"Yeah. I also heard she distributes food regularly!\"</p><p>\"Yup, she'll spare you and give you food, all right. But that's after she rips the skin off of your skull. They say that you can see the tower of skulls she piled up clearly if you go over there. I heard the bulge in the horizon looks as if the ground has an erection.\" </p><p>\"At any rate, the way you talk is really crude...\" </p><p>\"If I'm crude, then you're vulgar, you fuck.\"</p><p>\"Whether you two are crude or vulgar is not an important matter. If need be, it may be applicable to both sides. In truth, there is an incredibly high chance that it can be applied to both sides. The important thing is that the soldiers....\",</p><p>\"The soldiers are shaking up. Did they say it was a class strife? Every time battle erupts, I heard they use amplification magic and repeat that exact same speech from the previous day.

      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><h3>\n\tVolume 4 – Chapter 2 – Thou Come to Me</h3><p>\n\tI’ll admit it now. I’m a son of a bitch. If I’m to be a bit more honest, then I should confess that I’m not just a simple son of a bitch, but a very intelligent son of a bitch.</p><p>\n\tI was not only the smartest person among the people I knew, but I was also the most honest. To be exact, as I was smart enough to realize that I was a son of a bitch, I was also honest enough to admit only that fact. Individuals who possessed both wisdom and honesty, like myself, were rare to find.</p><p>\n\tIf someone were to approach that me and inquire what I thought was the most well-done thing that I’ve ever done in my life, then the boundlessly honest me, the limitlessly wise me, would have no other choice but to respond like this.</p><p>\n\tThat it was the act of shoving my father into prison.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tThree days since I was imprisoned.</p><p>\n\tRain descended today as well. My hair was completely drenched and was now hampering my eyes. I left it to be soaked. Even if I brush my hair aside, what would that change? Because of the spring rain, even my inner flesh was aching.</p><p>\n\tAh, Farnese.</p><p>\n\tI see that because both you and I carry the sin of having a bad father, our minds have been crippled. Why are we not twisted when we have been trying to accept the world with our disabled bodies? Why do our knees not collapse? If we are breaking the world, then all we need to do is attempt to throw aside the weight before our knees buckle, but when people witness us doing that, they criticize us for being cruel.</p><p>\n\tIt has only been three days since the speech was given, but I had received information that, within the enemy front lines, the rumors that Farnese was an illegitimate child from a Duke’s house, was sold off as a slave, and that her blood mother was a whore, were already widespread.</p><p>\n\tEven if Farnese’s defamation was fast, this was tremendously fast. Should I say that’s the Imperial Princess Elizabeth for you?  She was no fool. Illegitimate child, slave, and whore. These were all nothing but stimulating words. She knew how to attack the figurehead. Truly, she was flawless.</p><p>\n\tIf possible, I wanted to organize the structure of the Crescent Alliance a day sooner and effectively retaliate against the Imperial Princess Elizabeth. More than anything else, the current three faction structure, in other words, there was a need to overcome this system where the Mountain Faction-Neutral Faction-Plains Faction were splitting up the military power. This was an obvious task. For these people to split the forces into three parts when we would still be lacking even if we were to combine together, it was difficult to see them as sane.</p><p>\n\tA Crescent Alliance that has become one. Not an army where Barbatos or Paimon is the center, but a Crescent Alliance centered around me, must be formed. In order to do so, three conditions must be met.</p><p>\n\tFirst, I have to clearly prove the fact that I am very competent. If I am incompetent, then the reason to put me at the center of the Crescent Alliance would disappear.</p><p>\n\tSecond, I have to also prove that Farnese is extremely competent as well. If she were incompetent, then the need to appoint her as the figurehead would vanish. For example, the situation where I will be spared at the price of purging Farnese had occurred. The recent occurrence belonged to this sort of flow of events. In short, the Demon Lords have yet to realize Farnese’s competence.</p><p>\n\tAnd finally, the third. I had to prove the fact that the Imperial Princess Elizabeth was heinously competent. If the Imperial Princess were incompetent, then the reason to keep Farnese and myself alive in order to stand against her, will perish. The delusion that they alone would be sufficient to stand against her, was highly likely to spread throughout the Demon Lords. 〈Dungeon Attack〉 was the product of such a future where this delusion had completely controlled the Demon Lord army. It was the worst case scenario that must be avoided at all costs.</p><p>\n\t Surely, it was battle. Battle was the answer. By engaging in a large fight, let us prove to them who the most competent individuals of this era are. I desired for a magnificent, and yet, comedic battle.</p><p>\n\tChild, quickly achieve a tremendous victory and return.</p><p>\n\tThere are many things I wish to tell you.</p><p>\n\tI was here in this prison.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p><strong>▯</strong><strong>The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian</strong></p><p><strong>\t Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 6</strong></p><p><strong>\t Bruno Plains, Army of the Crescent Alliance, Simple Prison</strong></p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t“Oi, Skinnybones. Eat this and live. You have to eat for a living, too.”</p><p>\n\tAround evening.</p><p>\n\tA woman with a figure that was large like a pole approached me. The individual known as rank 12th, Demon Lord Sitri, was on night watch today. Since I was a prisoner with a special status, and since the nature of my crime was severely political, the Demon Lords would stand on night watch one person at a time and in a rotation. It was a rather luxurious reception.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tThe surveillance lasted throughout the day. There were several torches around the animal cage, but it seems they were imbued with some sort of magic since they did not get extinguished easily despite having been drenched by rainwater. As the torches burned throughout the night, the surveillants, who depended on that light, stared at me deviously.</p><p>\n\tFor the past 3 days, the personalities of the surveillants differed in various ways. A certain Demon Lord, who was dispatched from the Plains Faction, seemed to have truly suspected that I would try and make an escape so they personally held a torch in their hand and came close to the cage in order to monitor me up close. It seems they sincerely believed that I had committed high treason, but on the contrary, I welcomed that innocence.</p><p>\n\tIn case I was aiming to escape, in case I was making contact with the outside, or if either of those didn’t happen, then in case I was leisurely enjoying my time here after having secretly received from one of the other guards a type of luxury or debauchery, which prisoners were absolutely not allowed to have. Without blinking even once, the surveillant kept watching me. The large man, who introduced himself as Beleth, was the rank 13th Demon Lord.</p><p>\n\tThe people from the Neutral Faction handled the surveillance half-heartedly. They would openly promise that they would provide me with special meals or snacks if I asked them for some. In their perspective, they claimed that in some ways I, Dantalian, had committed a crime but in other ways, I had not, therefore, the thing to determine which side was correct purely depended on the negotiation between the Plains Faction and the Mountain Faction. At this point, since I’m not a criminal, but be that as it may, that didn’t make me not a criminal, they didn’t have a need to punish me nor did they have a requirement to serve me. As a result, they stated that if it’s something simple like giving me a meal, then they can at least show kindness in that regard. I politely refused their goodwill.</p><p>\n\tA handful of straw for sleeping purposes.</p><p>\n\tAn uncomfortable and hard wooden chair.</p><p>\n\tThose were all the things that were provided for me.</p><p>\n\tI spent my time watching the raining sky. Occasionally, Lapis or Farnese would come find me in order to give me a report on what had happened thus far. Although Lapis tried to take my life, unfortunately, there were firm metal bars placed between us. Lapis told me off because I had made the situation worse when the issue wasn’t something that I had to go out of my way to be imprisoned for. I shrugged my shoulders and said nothing more.</p><p>\n\tIf I were to speak honestly, then I felt safer and more comfortable within this prison cell than I did outside. I was quite the extreme bastard. The only thing that I required was either a place to sleep with a 3-meter radius or the entire world. In regards to which side piled up comparatively less stress, the former was a rank higher than the latter. It’s paradise, I say. Paradise.</p><p>\n\t“Although I really, really don’t like you. Regardless of that, I believe that someone shouldn’t be unable to eat just because someone else doesn’t like them, you know?”</p><p>\n\tDemon Lord Sitri, who volunteered to be the surveillant on the third day, was close to Paimon. She and I had a deep connection in various respects. Sitri had witnessed the sight of me breaking Paimon during the hearing, and during the process of preparing for this war, she had sent her subordinates to obstruct me. Although it was my first time facing her in person, I was not unfamiliar with her.</p><p>\n\tReferentially, even within the demon continent that is said to have many perverts, Sitri was a woman who was renowned for being a high-class pervert due to the fact that she had done all sorts of perverse acts. From what I have heard, she was not only an acquired hermaphrodite, but there was an extravagant record saying that she had slept with every single race, along with every gender of each race, that exists within the demon continent. The majority of the Demon Lords were like that.</p><p>\n\tSitri ripped a piece of bread and pushed it towards me between the bars.</p><p>\n\t“Here.”</p><p>\n\t“I have a body that is fine even if I do not eat anything in particular, though.”</p><p>\n\t“I heard it from the people who were keeping watch over you yesterday. They said you didn’t eat anything yesterday or the day before that, isn’t that right? Don’t do that. Even if us Demon Lords are fellows who are fine without food, you have to at least have one meal every two days. If you don’t, then you’ll lose it, you know?”</p><p>\n\tWhat does she mean by losing something?</p><p>\n\tI tilted my head.</p><p>\n\t“Lose what?”</p><p>\n\t“Your sense of living.”</p><p>\n\tSitri gazed this way while maintaining her posture of handing the piece of bread to me.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“It’s fine if you don’t particularly eat, right? It’s fine if you don’t particularly sleep, right? There’s quite the number of Demon Lords who became vegetables because they got used to that. Why do you think only half of all the Demon Lords are participating in the Crescent Alliance?”</p><p>\n\tAlthough there is probably a political reason behind that.</p><p>\n\tSitri shook her head.</p><p>\n\t“I’m a meathead, so I don’t really understand difficult things that well. Things like politics are something Big Sis Paimon will think about and contemplate. But there are fellows who completely lose their facial expressions after having lived off of only liquids for an entire month. Did you know that those guys are really interesting? They react if you touch their bodies, but even if you tickle them or beat them, their faces stay void of emotions, void. Thinking their expression would perhaps come back if I did this, I even tried raping them, but nothing changed. It never came back.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Eat. You’ll be able to live if you eat.”</p><p>\n\tI carefully received the piece of bread.</p><p>\n\tOnly then did Sitri nod in satisfaction. She then sat flat on the ground and ate her portion of the bread. Really, each and every one of her actions felt barbaric. The most luxurious lady among the Demon Lords was Paimon, and yet the people actually around her were like this. It was surprising.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tIn an area a slight distance away, there were two guards standing there. It was most likely for the purpose of hiding their identities, but they were concealing themselves by wearing a white military uniform from head to toe. They didn’t give any particular response even after witnessing Sitri sit down so uncourteously. That must mean that this was her normal behavior, this Demon Lord called Sitri.</p><p>\n\t“You’re sex-friends with that bitch Barbatos, right? How is it? Does she appear even slightly like a decent person when having sex?”</p><p>\n\tI shrugged my shoulders.</p><p>\n\t“That is a question that severely invades one’s privacy.”</p><p>\n\t“No, it’s because it’s surprising, really surprising. Though it’s intriguing that among the Demon Lords, Barbatos was the one to make a sex-friend, but yeah. It’s that, you know? That. You’re living rather well while having sex with that sort of bitch— that sort of feeling? Did you know that among the people she’s gone out with thus far, excluding one person, all of them have died by her hands?”</p><p>\n\tBarbatos.</p><p>\n\tI shouldn’t be the one to say this, but you need to watch your public image a bit.</p><p>\n\t“But that is something I am hearing for the first time. The fact that she has killed all of her lovers. That is interesting. Is it possible to tell me the details?”</p><p>\n\t“Yeah. But when I think about it, this is something that seriously invades someone’s privacy as well, you know?”</p><p>\n\tSitri casually chewed on the bread.</p><p>\n\t“If I reveal someone else’s private life, then I’ll be the only one who’d become a bad bitch. That’s why you tell me first about how it’s like to have sex with Barbatos. If someone’s going to become a bad bitch, then everyone has to become a bad bitch together.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tRank 12th, Demon Lord Sitri was an individual who properly understood how to bargain.</p><p>\n\tNo, in the first place, I’m a man.</p><p>\n\tI’m not sure if it were a bad bastard, but I’m incapable of becoming a bad bitch.</p><p>\n\tOnce I pointed that out, Sitri furrowed her brow.</p><p>\n\t“Skinnybones, when you call someone a son of a bitch, do you call them that because you believe they’re really the child of a dog?”</p><p>\n\t“No.”</p><p>\n\t“Retard is something you say to someone who isn’t a retard, right?”</p><p>\n\t“Yes.”</p><p>\n\t“Then ‘son of a bitch’ and ‘retard’. I’m sorry, but can you tell me the reason why I can swear at you by calling you a son of a bitch and a retard, but I can’t call you a bad bitch?”</p><p>\n\tI couldn’t give a response.</p><p>\n\tAs a result, I was forced into a position where I had to give a vivid description of, and also depict, how it was like to have sex with Barbatos. I’m not sure how exactly I had ended up in this state, but I did. I cleared my throat.</p><p>\n\t“First off, Miss Sitri, Barbatos has a very colorful variety of facial expressions. Even if she normally goes around laughing confidently, she is different when on top of a bed. Of course, we do not only do it on top of a bed but beside the bed, on the floor, somewhere with something to grab, or somewhere that has nothing to grab whatsoever, as we fornicate freely, speaking strictly, you can see it as Barbatos showing a different appearance in an incredible amount of many different places. In that regard, Barbatos is not a bad bitch who only goes around laughing like everyone assumes.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“Hoh, hoh.”</p><p>\n\tSitri nodded her head. The sight of her eyes sparkling in anticipation made it appear as if she were some female middle school student who was earnestly listening to a sex education class.</p><p>\n\t“And so?”</p><p>\n\t“First, according to who decides to take the role as the master and who decides to take the role as the slave for that day’s copulating session⎯⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>\n\tI explained.</p><p>\n\t“Even if the leading position changes slightly every day, according to the overall agreement we make either implicitly or explicitly, scat is not allowed but golden showers are okay⎯⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>\n\tI explained.</p><p>\n\t“Related to that, since the number of spells Barbatos made herself is quite substantial, she can freely control the degree of sensitivity and the degree of what can be endured beyond one’s capabilities⎯⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>\n\tI continued to explain.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tAs the explanation went on and on, Sitri’s eyes, which were once sparkling, became dim and murky until eventually, it became the complete opposite meaning, in other words, her eyes degenerated until they were no longer sparkling in interest, but instead, they were glinting with scorn like the eyes of a dead fish. After vomiting twice and clearing her insides, Sitri spoke.</p><p>\n\t“Wooow. You guys are really fucked up.”</p><p>\n\tThat was an unreasonable criticism.</p><p>\n\t“Do you really want to live while doing that? No, that’s the wrong way around. Do you really want to do that while you live? Can’t you fool around a bit more normally?”</p><p>\n\t“Although I wish to do so, it seems Barbatos does not like ordinary things.”</p><p>\n\t“Don’t make me laugh. When you were describing everything to me your face was full of life and you sounded as if you were rejoicing. You two are both serious perverts.”</p><p>\n\tThat was a ridiculous slander.</p><p>\n\t“Wow, how am I supposed to look at that bitch, Barbatos’s face from now on? Won’t I recall your explanation every time I see her? With that face, with that small physique. Oh God. Hey, what exactly did you tell me just now? Why did you tell me something like this? Do you want to die?”</p><p>\n\t“Oh dear. I voiced my refusal to tell you the details but did Miss Sitri not keep insisting me to tell you anyway?”</p><p>\n\t“Even I didn’t expect it to be this much. Although at one point I did consider the chance that perverts like that may exist somewhere in the world, I didn’t possibly expect that it’d be the two of you. Even if perverts like that existed, I believed that I should accept them with a liberal mind, but after meeting one in person, I don’t think I can. I’m sorry, but can you die a bit?”</p><p>\n\tShe was an absurd person.</p><p>\n\tIt was now my turn to ask.</p><p>\n\t“Miss Sitri, it is your turn to tell me now. Is it true that Barbatos dealt with every single one of her lovers with her own two hands?”</p><p>\n\t“Not all. It was all of them excluding one.”</p><p>\n\t“Is that not the same thing?”</p><p>\n\t“Mm.”</p><p>\n\tSitri scratched the back of her head.</p><p>\n\t“Well, wouldn’t it be her way of handling her own weaknesses? Essentially, Barbatos doesn’t trust people. She’s been betrayed a lot and she’s betrayed others a lot. But aren’t lovers a relationship where one side can be betrayed easily and can also betray the other side easily? If you’re going to be betrayed anyway, then betraying them first would make your mind feel a bit more at ease.”</p><p>\n\t“That sounds like an extreme assumption.”</p><p>\n\t“What I’m trying to say is.”</p><p>\n\tSitri let out a sigh.</p><p>\n\t“She uses black magic really fucking well, right? Barbatos wasn’t originally a mage, she was a warrior. But she got massively betrayed once during a war, so that’s why she converted to a necromancer.”</p><p>\n\t“What is the relation between being betrayed and becoming a necromancer?”</p><p>\n\tSitri tilted her head.</p><p>\n\t“Corpses, I’m talking about corpses. You can control corpses with necromancy, you know? Corpses that have already died will also never betray you.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“I know. That feeling you have right now. She’s really mental, right? That’s why I don’t like her. I understand that the betrayal must have been a shock. However, how should I say it? It’s that, that sort of feeling.”</p><p>\n\tIt was drastic.</p><p>\n\tNow that I think about it.</p><p>\n\tNow that I look back at it.</p><p>\n\tDuring that night when snow fell heavily, after furtively waking me up and dragging me outside, Barbatos showed to me the sight of her raising a massive army of undead as if she were trying to show off What was going through her head at that moment?</p><p>\n\tWhat was her ulterior motive behind triumphantly showing to me, the person who was, as her lover, standing in the easiest position to betray and be betrayed by her, the soldiers that will absolutely never go against her?</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tSitri spoke.</p><p>\n\t“It’s possible to gain scars while you live your life. But what’s with the people who try to scar the world back just because they got hurt? Isn’t that the complete opposite? Since I was scarred, I should pursue that much more a world where other people won’t be injured. People should have a good attitude like that.”</p><p>\n\tSurely.</p><p>\n\tI understood.</p><p>\n\tSitri was different compared to <strong>us</strong>.</p><p>\n\tThe day she is able to comprehend Barbatos, me, Lapis, or Farnese will most likely never arrive. That incomprehension was neither sad nor unreasonable. It was beautiful and rational. It was fine for her to live on as herself.</p><p>\n\tI smiled contently for the first time in a long while.</p><p>\n\t“I see Miss Sitri is a good individual.”</p><p>\n\t“Hm?”</p><p>\n\t“It would be great if there were only people like yourself in the world. However, it cannot be helped. Barbatos is a strong woman. If there were an incident that was capable of completely changing Barbatos, then, although I do not know what it was, it must have been that much of a tremendous occurrence. Nothing can be done about it. Please show some understanding.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tSitri stared straight at my face.</p><p>\n\t“You, do you even know what sort of situation you’re in right now? It’s the same as Barbatos having locked you up herself. So why are you sticking up for her?”</p><p>\n\t“I did not stick up for anyone. I am merely acknowledging the fact that something inevitable is inevitable. I consider myself to be a son of a bitch, but at the same time, I am an honest son of a bitch. It’s unexpectedly difficult, the way of the world, that is.”</p><p>\n\tI chuckled lightly.</p><p>\n\t“I feel as if it is about time I should ask. Miss Sitri, have I passed?”</p><p>\n\t“Passed?”</p><p>\n\t“I am asking if you believe it is fine to not kill me. Please do not feign ignorance. Did you not lace the piece of bread that you handed to me with poison?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tSitri’s expression froze for a moment.</p><p>\n\tA silence fell over us for a long period of time.</p><p>\n\tThe heavy rain changed into a drizzle and made it seem as if the sky was salting the earth. I took off my top and wiped my body with a ragged towel. Even if I were to allow myself to be hit by the rain, I had to wipe myself at appropriate times in order to avoid catching a cold. The reason why my insides felt cold was most likely not solely because of the rain.</p><p>\n\tSitri opened her lips.</p><p>\n\t“How?”</p><p>\n\t“I wonder? There were quite a lot of signs. First off, you approached me while acting in a much too friendly manner. You tore the bread into two pieces and handed me one-half, while Miss Sitri, you personally ate the other. That is a behavior which is normally seen between two people who are close to one another like family members. On the other hand, the relationship between Miss Sitri and myself is Mm, not too favorable.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tSitri was close to Paimon. In Sitri’s perspective, it wouldn’t be lacking to assume that I was Paimon’s political enemy. But Sitri approached me, who was that sort of individual, in a friendly manner and handed me a piece of bread?</p><p>\n\tIt is possible to merely consider her as someone who has generosity and does not care about trifling things. In truth, that is a positive outlook. Sadly, ever since I was born, I have been a bastard who barely has any memories of himself looking at the world in a positive perspective. She had some underlying motive. It was sensible to arrive at such a conclusion.</p><p>\n\tFor example, something like purposely eating the same bread in order to not be suspected for having poisoned the food.</p><p>\n\tThrough such a process, I made my assumption.</p><p>\n\tI did so ever since I was very little.</p><p>\n\t“Next would be the part where you vomited after having heard about the obscene antics between Barbatos and myself. I am not deaf. I recall hearing people say several times about how you, Miss Sitri, have quite a high level of perversion. In comparison to such an individual, the acts carried out between Barbatos and myself are most likely nothing more than child’s play. Despite that, you dry heaved. I could only judge it as you having deliberately forced out whatever was in your stomach.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“I am not sure what your reason behind poisoning me is, but let us leisurely discuss it now. For starters, the antidote. You have it, right? If it is not a discourtesy, then please hand it over. Even if I have quite a numerous amount of experiences in being poisoned, certainly, something that cannot be helped, cannot be helped. I am unable to throw away my desire to live.”</p><p>\n\tNow then.</p><p>\n\tI stuck out my hand.</p><p>\n\tSitri looked at my hand with a rigid face. It was a bit troubling since the only thing she continued to give me was a vacant gaze. Does she have no intention to hand me the antidote? Despite how I am, I am a man who has only considered his death to happen by the hands of either Lapis or by the hands of Elizabeth. If I get poisoned to death by some side character like you, then that would be dishonorable to those two girls.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“It is fine if I were to scream right now. Those sentinels over there standing guard will most likely come running here. It will be over then. As I will testify that Miss Sitri had attempted to kill me with poison, as much as Miss Sitri is a close aid to Her Excellency, Paimon, the entire Mountain Faction will be held accountable for that crime. Do you wish for that to happen?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“After the military trial was rejected, the Demon Lord, who all three factions were taking custody of together, was assassinated by one of the leading members of the Mountain Faction. How marvelous. I can vividly see this being shouted throughout the demon continent. Aha, of course, if causing a commotion is Miss Sitri’s hobby, then I will not stop you. That is good. Chaos. I too like it quite a lot.”</p><p>\n\tSitri bit her lips tightly.</p><p>\n\tShe slid her hand into her coat pocket and pulled out a glass vial. A bright yellow liquid, that looked similar to natural honey, sloshed around within the bottle. I received the glass vial and gulped the liquid down in a single motion.</p><p>\n\tMm, what a foul taste. It seriously tastes bad. Why is it that there are many types of poisons that taste nice, but the actual antidotes all taste revolting? It was puzzling.</p><p>\n\t“I’m saying this beforehand, but this has absolutely no relation to big sis Paimon. This is something I did arbitrarily.”</p><p>\n\t“A good excuse. At the very least, it sounds like a plausible excuse to my ears. I shall personally hope that the other Demon Lords, as well, hear it in the same manner as I did during court.”</p><p>\n\tIt was at that moment.</p><p>\n\tOne of the soldiers, who was standing guard a slight distance away from the prison, took off their white military uniform. Once their military cap fell off and their mantle was set free, the person standing there was, surprisingly, Demon Lord Paimon. The look of panic was apparent on her face. Even until this moment, this was a sufficiently intriguing performance, but what Paimon said to Sitri was more well-worth seeing.</p><p>\n\t“Sitri, you! You said that you wished to test him for a moment in order to see what kind of person he was, but for you to use poison! Did the test have this sort of meaning!?”</p><p>\n\tSitri scratched the back of her head.</p><p>\n\t“Haa. Sis, as expected, I don’t like this guy. A certain smell is coming off from him. The smell of a corpse rotting. It goes without saying that as much as sis is the leader of the Mountain Faction, I don’t have even the slightest right to disagree, but.”</p><p>\n\t“You fool! That is not the problem right now!”</p><p>\n\tPaimon hurriedly ran directly in front of my cell and lowered her head. It wasn’t only once. Two times, three times, four times, as if she were literally trying to confirm just how close her existence was to the ground, she bowed her head multiple times.</p><p>\n\t“This lady apologizes, Dantalian. This lady is sincerely sorry. Sitri did not have any bad intentions. It is just that, when it is something related to this lady, this child gets strangely worked up. This lady begs your pardon. This lady will do whatever is possible to apologize, so please forgive Sitri.”</p><p>\n\t“Did not have any bad intentions, is it?”</p><p>\n\tI leisurely watched over Paimon’s heated apology.</p><p>\n\tI did not feel impatient just because I had nearly been poisoned to death a second ago. In the political spectrum, a failed assassination attempt is one of the most deplorable crimes. Depending on how I utilized this, it had infinite value.</p><p>\n\tIn the first place, I did not trust Paimon even remotely. After all this time, there was no reason for me to be shocked even if she utilized means such as poison.</p><p>\n\t“It has not been even a single year since the day I had received an apology from Your Highness Paimon during the Walpurgis Night. At that time, Your Highness had tried to remove me politically. Since slander did not work, is it now poison and assassination? How remarkable.”</p><p>\n\tFrom start to end, I spoke sarcastically and in a calm tone. Paimon’s complexion paled.</p><p>\n\tThree days have passed since the war had begun. I had heard that during those several days, Paimon had obtained quite the good war record while facing against the imperial army of Francia. Although they have yet to carry out a decisive battle, it was fine to say that she had excellent results. Barbatos was displaying results that were the complete opposite of a good meaning by suffering huge losses while facing against the imperial army of Habsburg.</p><p>\n\tHowever, an attempted murder case contained an explosive force with the capability of overthrowing some huge loss like that in an instant. In Paimon’s perspective, this was no different to a nightmare.</p><p>\n\t“Dantalian, this lady is speaking the truth. Because this lady merely wished to officially accept you, Dantalian, into the Mountain Faction Before this lady could speak to you, Sitri requested of this lady to allow her to converse with you first in order to determine what type of individual you are.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“I see that within the Mountain Faction, you poison people and see how long they can endure in order to judge their character. That is impressive.”</p><p>\n\t“Dantalian.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon gazed at me with a face that appeared as if she were about to collapse at any moment. She slowly lowered herself to her knees. The ground, which was damp because of the rain, dirtied her skirt with mud. After seeing that, Sitri furrowed her brow.</p><p>\n\t“Sis, for that sort of man, you don’t.”</p><p>\n\t“Seal your lips. You have no right to speak.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon coldly cut off the words of her close aid.</p><p>\n\t“Dantalian. This lady understands that she does not appear as a trustworthy person to you. Yes, this lady has doubted you and slandered you several times before. Nevertheless, I assure you that there is not even the slightest amount of ulterior motive behind this proposal to accept you under the flag of the Mountain Faction. If you tell this lady to prove it, then she shall. Therefore, please listen to this lady’s words.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tIt was amazing.</p><p>\n\tWhat was amazing was the fact that Paimon’s acting ability was so impressive that it made it feel as if her words just now were passionately sincere. That brazen personality of hers, which supported her acting ability, was tremendous. My Lord. If it were someone else, then they would have probably been completely fooled by now.</p><p>\n\tThat’s why this woman.</p><p>\n\tNot only did she try to frame me for something ridiculous like spreading the disease on my own, but she tried to use the enemy by selling the Memoria artifact to the Imperial Princess Elizabeth. She purposely refused the military trial in order to come between Barbatos and myself, and if need be, this woman was someone who would do something daring like resorting to poison. And yet, she expected me to believe her when she claimed that there were no ill-intentions behind any of those actions.</p><p>\n\tWas it not splendid? Even my father was unable to become that outspokenly shameless. I unconsciously smiled bitterly.</p><p>\n\t“Please stand, Your Highness. That is disgraceful.”</p><p>\n\t“Pardon?”</p><p>\n\t“Is there any point if Your Highness were to receive myself into the Mountain Faction? No matter how much Your Highness loathes Barbatos, do you wish to go that far just to impair her? Of course, it is not something which I personally should be saying when I had voluntarily requested for my own trial because I was aware that Your Highness would behave in such a way.”</p><p>\n\tThat was so. In regard to the usage of other people’s emotions, Paimon and I were the same. The problem was, despite being like that, Paimon continued to act as if she were detached and upright, all on her lonesome.</p><p>\n\t“I am genuinely curious. Is it enjoyable to live like that?”</p><p>\n\tHave pride as a cunning person of influence, Paimon.</p><p>\n\tI am aware that you cherish your subjects. However, be it an evildoer using a good person or a good person using an evildoer, if you have used someone at your own discretion, then in that moment, both you and I have already become equal schemers. Are you and I both not beasts, savages that possess the teeth that can tear off an ample amount of another’s flesh?</p><p>\n\tPaimon pleaded.</p><p>\n\t“No, that is wrong. You are fundamentally misunderstanding something. Even regarding Barbatos, there is some large misunderstanding. Right now, right now is your last chance. You must grab this lady’s hand. Barbatos is truly going to purge you using this opportunity.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Sitri said it as well. Barbatos, that child does not leave alone the people who know her weakness. Barbatos is a master of acting. Quickly, if you do not enter the Mountain Faction and solidify your standing, then you will be purged in a blink of an eye and.”</p><p>\n\t“Alienation in a moment like this as well, is it?”</p><p>\n\tI let out a big sigh. Paimon flinched.</p><p>\n\tThis will not do.</p><p>\n\tI went through my clothes, which I had taken off earlier, beside me and took out a pocket watch. It was the evidence that went from Humbaba’s hand to Paimon’s, from Paimon’s hand to the Imperial Princess Elizabeth’s, and from the Imperial Princess Elizabeth’s hand to my own.</p><p>\n\t“That is.”</p><p>\n\tThis was an item that was familiar to even Paimon’s eyes. The focus of her red eyes trembled. I nodded my head and displayed the pocket watch to her.</p><p>\n\t“Oh dear. It appears as if you are quite familiar with this item, Your Highness. Have you, perhaps, recalled the moment in time when you had last seen it?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Yes, please stand up and take a closer look. This is a Memoria artifact. My acting general, Miss Laura De Farnese’s secret and origin is contained within this object. After the negotiation with the Imperial Princess of the Empire, she had passed this on to me. The Imperial Princess is a smart individual. By using this secret she would, without a doubt, assault Farnese’s dignity. Furthermore, the political blow that my acting general receives will most likely be transferred directly to me, as well.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tI hummed as if I were telling her an amusing story. However, as my words continued, Paimon’s face merely became more rigid.</p><p>\n\t“I am not certain who it was, but it seems whoever had gifted this to the Imperial Princess of the Empire must have abhorred me quite a lot. It is sad. I do not recall ever committing any particular wrongdoing, but for myself to receive such resentment. That is why even if I do not wish for it to happen, an antagonizing relation forms between myself and that person. Is that not the case, Your Highness?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tWhat’s with that face, Paimon? There aren’t a lot of things in the world that is as exciting as the progress of self-discovery. Therefore, even if that bare face of yours, which you had just discovered, was that of a ridiculously foul hypocrite, that is your true nature. If you are incapable of loving your own self, then who could possibly cherish you?</p><p>\n\tIt was fine. I, as expected, loved my own life that was insane about authority. The reason we loved life wasn’t because we were familiar with life, but because we were familiar with love. Even you shall one day love your hypocritical self.</p><p>\n\tI raised the corners of my mouth.</p><p>\n\t“Do not worry. I too am not a fool. At the very least, I know why the Imperial Princess had returned this sort of bomb to me. She most likely hoped that I would establish this as a problem and cause an internal strife within the Crescent Alliance. The Imperial Princess, too, is quite the outstanding figure.”</p><p>\n\tOn the day I had broken down the negotiation and returned to my camp, I was quite surprised to see the content within the pocket watch. I was moved and moved again by Paimon’s stubbornness that consistently tried to get rid of me. It was not a joke. Perhaps Paimon had jumped over logic and was able to sense it through her intuition.</p><p>\n\tThe fact that the individual who had moved this era was me, Dantalian.</p><p>\n\tPaimon was the first one to sense it among the existing authority figures. That was why she had struggled to get rid of me.</p><p>\n\tIt was a remarkable foresight. I shall appraise it highly. However, you had made a mistake. Instead of trying to ostracize me, you should have solely tried to pull me in. At the very least, similar to what Barbatos had done, you should have created a partnership where both parties used one another.</p><p>\n\tDuring the time when I still appeared like a pushover, your grave mistake was the fact that you had bared your teeth abruptly. The weak will never forget the arrogance of the strong.</p><p>\n\tNow then.</p><p>\n\t“Your Highness Paimon.”</p><p>\n\tThe fact that you are a backstabber, who had sold me out, has been explicitly revealed. What will you do now? Personally, I am tremendously curious about how much your shameless brazenface can endure.</p><p>\n\t“Do you, perhaps, have anything more to say to me?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon lowered her gaze. She did not raise her head immediately. Even from here, I could see her lips open, close, and open again.</p><p>\n\tShortly after, Paimon muttered in a small voice.</p><p>\n\t“sorry. Because this lady.”</p><p>\n\tWith a wavering voice that sounded as if it were flowing out from her innermost heart.</p><p>\n\t“Because this lady, is incompetent. Because she is incompetent to no end, this lady is sorry.”</p><p>\n\tThose were somewhat strange words to say as an apology.</p><p>\n\tPaimon no longer tried to plead or make any more excuses. She merely stood up, with her face still looking downwards, and left. The edge of her mantle, that had become dirtied by the rain, was dragged behind her like a tide.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tSitri, the culprit behind today’s incident, gazed at me with no emotion on her face before chasing after Paimon shortly after.</p><p>\n\tAnd thus, the only things which remained at my side were, once again, the handful of straw, the shabby wooden chair, and the two puddles of muddy water that had yet to dry. I was finally able to let out a sigh of relief once everyone was gone. Although it was a living that didn’t really have much, I was satisfied with just that.</p><p>\n\t“Haa.”</p><p>\n\tIs it about time now?</p><p>\n\tI looked up towards the dimmed night sky.</p><p>\n\tAlthough Paimon had insisted that I was misunderstanding something, on the contrary, that was something I wanted to say to her. Not just Paimon, but Barbatos as well seemed to be firmly misunderstanding a single thing. Similar to how Paimon seemed to believe that this was a war which she must handle, Barbatos seemed to think that this was a war that she had started. Unfortunately, they were both wrong. From start to finish, this war was mine.</p><p>\n\tThere was a need to make them realize this.</p><p>\n\tIf they planned to distance me from the war, then so be it. Try putting me far away. However, they will realize tomorrow.</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯⎯⎯The reality that even if I do not approach war, it will more than gladly approach me.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tFarnese.</p><p>\n\tOur time has come.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p><strong>▯</strong><strong>King’s Beloved Sword, Human, Laura De Farnese</strong></p><p><strong>\t Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 7</strong></p><p><strong>\t Bruno Plains, The Center of the Army of the Crescent Alliance</strong></p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tAuthority for blood.</p><p>\n\tBlood for authority.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tThis young lady stared up at the flag for a long period of time.</p><p>\n\tHis Lordship’s flag.

Since His Lordship is gone, it should feel as if the head of our forces were cut off, but it almost feels as if our tail was severed, making our body lighter.”</p><p>\n\t“Ahah. I’m only saying this because master isn’t here, but I’d like to say that I think likewise!”</p><p>\n\tThe Royal Guard’s captain cackled.</p><p>\n\tHer laughter, if this young lady were to go out of her way to express it, contained a certain something that could only be described as crazy-like. Strictly speaking, even the expression crazy-like was actually wrong. It was not as if she were crazy, but she was craziness in itself. If this young lady were to honestly confess, then among the people serving under His Lordship, this young lady was the only vassal that was at least sane.</p><p>\n\tMiss Lapis was more similar to that of an incredibly intelligent wild animal than that of a person. Starting from Humbaba, the leader of the Royal Guard, every single one of the witches were feathered animals whose heads were completely hell-bent on lust. His Lordship, who was taking care of these types of vassals on both of his sides, was literally a beast among beasts and the king among savage animals. On an impulse, an educated person such as this young lady was captured into this extremely dangerous zoo, so it was quite terrifying.</p><p>\n\tOh, it is an icy-cold season. Even though winter had passed, the season remained cold. For an intelligent woman such as this young lady to live, the wind of the world has become frigid one place at a time.</p><p>\n\tThe Royal Guard’s captain beamed and turned this way.</p><p>\n\t“Now then. Dear honorable acting general? Where should we mess up first?”</p><p>\n\t“Hm.”</p><p>\n\tThis young lady looked out onto the battlefield.</p><p>\n\tCurrently, our corps had obtained continuous victories.</p><p>\n\tThe Crescent Alliance and the Crusaders were confronting one another with a total of surprisingly 200,000 soldiers, which was extensive enough to carry out pitched battles. However, the reality was somewhat different. In the Crescent Alliance, the forces were separated into the Plains Faction, Neutral Faction, and the Mountain Faction. Each respective group was fighting by themselves. The Crusaders were the same, as well. Each of their nations operated their armies separately while fighting against us.</p><p>\n\tAs a result, as if the unit of 7,000 hired soldiers, which this young lady led, had become a detached force, we went through the battles unfolding on the field and poked at the enemy forces here and there.</p><p>\n\tYesterday we had swept away the knights of the Kingdom of Brittany. The day before yesterday we had slaughtered three earls from the Empire of Francia. The day before that was the regiment from the Republic of Batavia. It was a pleasing battlefield where there was a joy in picking your prey. Aah, how delightful. This young lady was in bliss. This young lady was certain that she was born into this regretful world in order to cause chaos here.</p><p>\n\tThe Crusaders have most likely begun to detest this young lady.</p><p>\n\tIt was about time to stop playing around and harvest the hatred.</p><p>\n\t“For the past several days, the human armies have continued to get done in by this young lady over and over again. Regardless of whether they were disparate groups separated according to their nations, if what is attached to their necks are heads and not empty shells, then they will be planning a joint operation.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“Aha. So the armies will join up and plan together in order to hunt us, is it? This, it’s not really our preference to fall from the position of hunter and into the position of prey.”</p><p>\n\tThis young lady nodded her head. It was the same for this young lady as well, in regards to not having a hobby of being hunted down.</p><p>\n\t“His Lordship gave this young lady an order. To not fight against the Imperial Princess of Habsburg. In other words, His Lordship does not wish for us to obtain a decisive win, nor does he wish for us to pretend as if we had met a decisive defeat.”</p><p>\n\t“Then?”</p><p>\n\t“Chaos. Solely that.”</p><p>\n\tThis young lady declared.</p><p>\n\t“His Lordship desires solely for chaos to spread throughout these plains. That is the command that was given to us by His Lordship.”</p><p>\n\tThis young lady lamented deeply.</p><p>\n\tWas this not an absurd lord? He did not order this young lady, who was no more than 17-years-old now, to win the battle, nor did he tell this young lady to lose convincingly, instead, he had commanded for this young lady to solely turn the entire battleground into a medley of discord. What is this young lady supposed to do about that sort of precise order given by His Lordship? Although this young lady had once contemplated about what she should do, this young lady’s decision had already been determined.</p><p>\n\t“Since this young lady is a faithful subject of sublimity, this young lady can only follow orders. Captain, sound the horns. You have done a good job obtaining only trivial benefits for the past 4 days. From this point forth, our forces shall genuinely turn this battlefield into a disaster.”</p><p>\n\t“Ahahahah—.”</p><p>\n\tThe leader of the Royal Guard, Humbaba, laughed.</p><p>\n\t“That’s good, chaos. That’s really really good. That’s one of the things which the likes of us love the most. Similar to how a pig needs to be shoved into some mud in order for it to understand that it’s a piglet, humans need to roll around in pools of blood for a bit in order for them to realize that they’re human bastards. We will more than gladly turn people into people alongside the General!”</p><p>\n\tAll at once, the witches took out a horn. Several sounds of horns rose into the sky like smoke.</p><p>\n\tDue to the sudden shower at dawn, the clouds were heavy and the sky was low. The sound easily reached the dark clouds made of moisture. The world was dark and the soldiers ended their break and raised their bodies like shadows. This young lady mounted her black horse and gazed out into the front line.</p><p>\n\tThe wind blew. It was a wind that contained spring.</p><p>\n\tBecause it had rained on intervals for the past several days, the front line was damp and saturated. The scent of early spring was dense, making it seem as if the meadow was soon going to be entirely painted over with a yellowish green color. This young lady felt as if there may be a scent of blood out there that even this natural paint could not possibly color or cover completely. Dyeing the world green was the jurisdiction of the season, and the supervision of coloring the earth red was this young lady’s task.</p><p>\n\t“Flag bearers forward.”</p><p>\n\t“Roger that. Flag bearers foooorward!”</p><p>\n\tThe witches hopped onto their brooms and lightly rose upwards. They became singers of the dark clouds’ undersides and started to sing our war song. In response to that, the soldiers of the ground chanted in unison. We showed off that the battle, which was anguish and lament on the other side, was nothing more than a single type of <strong>melody</strong> to us.</p><p>\n\t“All forces. Advance.”</p><p>\n\tAnd thus, our unit advanced.</p><p>\n\tThe field of battle was systematic. The army of a hundred thousand and the army of a hundred thousand were both standing in formation and approached one another as so. Since it was obvious that if a single unit were to abruptly rush forward, they would immediately be ganged up on, be it the enemy forces or the allied forces, they were all having a battle of wits. While breaking free from the very center, this young lady ordered.</p><p>\n\t“All forces. Continue to advance.”</p><p>\n\tThe witches laughed and repeated my order.</p><p>\n\t“Continue to advaaaance!”</p><p>\n\tIn a single moment, our troops protruded from the army of a hundred thousand, the Crescent Alliance encampment and went forward. It was evident that the other Demon Lords’ units in the distance were showing signs of confusion. There were even people who sent messengers, questioning us on what we think we were doing. After telling the messengers ‘Understood, we shall adjust our speed’, and sending them back, this young lady emotionlessly gave another command.</p><p>\n\t“Advance at maximum speed.”</p><p>\n\t“Advance at maximuuum speeeeed!”</p><p>\n\tNow then.</p><p>\n\tAlthough His Lordship was a butcher-like man among bastards, that man was this young lady’s one and only lord. The man who had found solely this young lady within this vast continent and took her in. The person who had become this young lady’s new family. It would be good to know that this young lady will not lightly overlook the crime of them having dared to imprison this young lady’s lord, man, and family, into a pig cage.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tIt did not matter whether they were the Crescent Alliance or the Crusaders. Come at this young lady altogether. You all are nothing more than mere audiences, is that not so?</p><p>\n\tThis battle is simply a melody for His Lordship performed by this young lady.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p><strong>▯</strong><strong>Demon Lord of Immortality, Rank 8th, Barbatos</strong></p><p><strong>\t Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 7</strong></p><p><strong>\t Bruno Plains, The Right Wing of the Army of the Crescent Alliance</strong></p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tAaah. This isn’t fun.</p><p>\n\tThis really, really isn’t fun⎯⎯⎯.</p><p>\n\tFrom start to end, this war hasn’t proceeded as I wanted it to.</p><p>\n\tWe’ve been facing off against the imperial army of Habsburg since a couple of days ago, but these guys aren’t moving like I want them to.</p><p>\n\tDid they say her name was the Imperial Princess Elizabeth? This person, she doesn’t come out rashly even if we mess with her, and she comes after us wholeheartedly whenever we back off. She was well-versed with the fundamentals of tactics.</p><p>\n\tA sound enemy was one of the most detestable existences out there, second to a fragile ally. Mmmm. I predict this will be a prolonged war. Well, we can just hold out by pillaging whatever supplies we lack. It’s not a particular problem. As I suspected, this lacked a type of boom, a splendidly explosive feeling.</p><p>\n\tRegardless of that, we couldn’t ignore that imperial army and leave them be. We did so a couple of times before, but each time I spectated them from the side, they really wreaked havoc. Both the Mountain Faction and the Neutral Faction had already been defeated by the Imperial Princess Elizabeth once. Fuck. This damn regretful world. I’m the only reliable ally here.</p><p>\n\tNo, if we’re only going to quibble about reliability, then should I also acknowledge that human bitch?</p><p>\n\tLaura De Farnese.</p><p>\n\tThe girl, who Dantalian had brought from who knows where and had abruptly appointed as his acting general, surely resembled that master of hers exactly since her rudeness was on point.</p><p>\n\tShe wasn’t going to war seriously. This was something you could tell right when you looked at her. That girl was enjoying the war.</p><p>\n\tShe could have pulled the enemy in and annihilated them with ease, but she would just torment them for 3 hours and then let them go. The reason was probably simple. It was because it’d be a waste if she swallowed them right off the bat. Her intent, to lacerate them a little bit at a time and harass them until they’ve been squeezed dry, emanated from her like a rising smoke. As a single respectable military commander, I could affirm.</p><p>\n\tShe was trash⎯⎯.</p><p>\n\tComplete trash⎯⎯.</p><p>\n\tFor what reason were even Dantalian’s vassals filled to the brim with trash? People say that master and servant were usually alike, and this was exactly that case. We have to purge him at some point, but that Paimon bitch keeps intervening.</p><p>\n\t“Haaa.”</p><p>\n\tA sigh came out on its own.</p><p>\n\tI have to exterminate the human race, I have to annihilate the enemy forces, I have to kill Paimon, and I have to stomp an appropriate amount of manners into Dantalian, there are so many things I have to do, and yet time keeps passing by slowly. At this rate, I’m afraid that things will still be this way even after another 500 years flows by.</p><p>\n\tWell, a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step. If you exclude the fact that that single step was annoyingly tiresome. With immensely tired eyes, I stared out into the front line and contemplated where we should go in order to fight.</p><p>\n\tAt that moment.</p><p>\n\t“?”</p><p>\n\tA single army within the Crescent Alliance started to move. After using magic to enhance my eyesight, I could see a black flag with two lines written on it using silver thread.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tAuthority for blood.</p><p>\n\tBlood for authority.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tWithout a doubt, that fucking cheesy maxim belonged to only one individual, Dantalian. In other words, that means that human bitch has made her troops advance.</p><p>\n\tThey crawled all the way to the center of the plain and openly started to put down wooden fences there. Should I call it a defensive position? In any case, the earth was weak to no end because it had rained for several days, so even if they set up fences there, those fences were fated to soon collapse. In the center of the field, which was completely deserted, that human child’s unit started to set up their position.</p><p>\n\t“Haah? Fuck. What are those guys trying to pull?”</p><p>\n\tI turned around and asked. The Demon Lords of the Plains Faction were standing there. My subordinates exchanged glances with one another but they were unable to say anything. That was obvious. There wasn’t anyone civil enough to ordinarily interpret that sort of absurd action within our faction.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“Just what kind of bitch is that bitch supposed to be? Aang? Does she seriously see the battlefield as some sort of playground? If that lord of hers is in prison, then she should just be docile, but why is she going completely insane on her own again?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tMy subordinates hesitantly tried to avoid answering. However, since there was someone among them who had their head on straight, or at the very least, tried to keep it on straight, he spoke with a voice filled with suspicion.</p><p>\n\t“Although I am afraid to judge a person’s intention rashly, no matter how you look at it, are they not trying to provoke the enemy forces?”</p><p>\n\t“Provoke?”</p><p>\n\t“Yes. For the past couple of days, a considerable number of human armies have been done in by them already. After sustaining damage from a girl, who’s no older than 17 years old, it must be difficult for them to bear that fact because of the thick sense of pride those humans have. If they provoke the humans so gallantly like that, then even if it risks their dignity, the humans would have no other choice but to come out.”</p><p>\n\tHmm.</p><p>\n\tIt isn’t a completely ridiculous logic.</p><p>\n\tThe problem was if that provocation actually worked properly. Despite their looks, the humans have a massive army of a hundred thousand. They say that a considerable number of their army was mixed with ragtag groups, but that was the same for our side, as well. Even if there were ragtag groups mixed in the human forces, it was obvious that the girl’s army of 7,000 wouldn’t possibly be able to last if a massive army of a hundred thousand were to approach them.</p><p>\n\tIn any case, thanks to her rushing forward like that, our slack military camp, that was connected by the left wing-center army-right wing, had broken apart. If a hole forms in the center army just like that, then the ones that’ll have to carry the burden will be us since we’re holding the rest of the formation.</p><p>\n\tAaah. It can’t be helped. Since it’s bothersome, I moved my hand half-heartedly.</p><p>\n\t“Oi, be prepared to fill in the hole that bitch is going to leave. Zepar, lead our reserve troops and be prepared to move to the center if need be.”</p><p>\n\t“Yes, Your Excellency.”</p><p>\n\tThe thousands of reserve soldiers under my command immediately departed. The inside of my mouth tasted bitter. However, it was better for our military power to diminish a bit if it meant that we could prevent the center army from collapsing.</p><p>\n\tAfter concluding the decision like that, I was about to draw out in my head today’s war strategy, but, drip, something fell down onto my neck. It was cold. Once I looked up towards the sky, several drops of rain started to descend. It fell yesterday and the day before that, making it so that the early spring rain simply felt wearisome now.</p><p>\n\t“?”</p><p>\n\tWait.</p><p>\n\tRain?</p><p>\n\tAn incentive using rain?</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯⎯⎯My mind cleared up instantly.</p><p>\n\tAt any rate, the earth has continued to soak up moisture due to the rain this entire time. Several places throughout the battlefield were engulfed in muddy water. If rain were to fall here once more, then be it the human army or us Crescent Alliance, the number of tactics we can utilize will be narrowed down extremely. Especially in terms of offense and not defense. I furrowed my brow and glared at that girl’s unit that had, at some point, finished establishing their defensive formation far out into the front line.</p><p>\n\t“Don’t tell me, they’re?”</p><p>\n\tIn that moment, the sound of a horn resonated boisterously from the other side of the plain. Once I turned my head, the human armies had finally executed a charge. Because of the rain, they were charging with the cavalry positioned at the front instead of the aerial mages. After witnessing that, any fragment of drowsiness that remained within me had vanished completely and I stood up from my spot.</p><p>\n\t“Ah, fuck. That bitch started something.”</p><p>\n\t“Pardon?”</p><p>\n\tMy subordinates’ gazes all focused on me at once. Though I really don’t like it. Though I seriously don’t like going to battle while being dragged around, not by my own will, but by someone else’s, regardless of that, I had to give the order.</p><p>\n\t“Get ready to go to battle, you morons! It’s a battle of annihilation. An encirclement battle of annihilation, at that!”</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p><strong>▯</strong><strong>Demon Lord of Benevolence, Rank 9th, Paimon</strong></p><p><strong>\t Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 7</strong></p><p><strong>\t Bruno Plains, The Left Wing of the Army of the Crescent Alliance</strong></p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t“This is.”</p><p>\n\tA breath escaped from this lady’s lips unintentionally.</p><p>\n\tThe progress of battle moved urgently. Until just a short moment ago, things were not flowing like this. The left wing and the right wing will each handle a single army and carry out a close-pitched battle. Without a doubt, we had planned to carry out the first assault with that sort of standard tactic today.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tHowever, after the unit, led by the girl known as Farnese, had protruded forward, the flow had changed completely.</p><p>\n\tThat girl was the very person who had gone forward to give the speech as the representative of the Crescent Alliance, despite being a human. In the enemy’s perspective, she was a traitor who they had to deal with as soon as possible. If they are able to obtain Farnese’s head, then that would most likely be considered as the greatest merit. A tempting game.</p><p>\n\tHaving become blinded by that, the human armies had thoughtlessly ordered their cavalries to charge. At first, the Kingdom of Polish-Lithuania, then the Empire of Francia, Republic of Batavia, Kingdom of Teuton. Each army, contesting for military merits, sent in their cavalry.</p><p>\n\tIt was that very action that was a poor move.</p><p>\n\tThe cavalries, that charged in simultaneously from all sides, were unable to link together properly, and they were unable to even obtain a wide space. The weather was especially bad. After adding more rain to the earth that was already filled with moisture, the ground had turned marshy. Once tens of thousands of hooves passed over that muddy water⎯⎯⎯⎯ the earth instantly became a quagmire similar to that of a soft and wet swamp.</p><p>\n\tThe thing that fell upon the enemy cavalry regiment, which had fallen into the mire and was floundering, was a continuous rain of bolts from the crossbowmen who were placed at the front of Farnese’s unit, making it seem as if she had been waiting for this moment the entire time. Because their front was obstructed by a mire and their rear was blocked by the approaching reinforcements from the other armies, the cavalry, which consisted of no less than ten thousand men, was literally slaughtered.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tThis lady was petrified.</p><p>\n\tThat, was not a battle.</p><p>\n\tSimilar to our Crescent Alliance, the Crusaders of mankind were nothing more than a loose alliance. They did not have a unity of command. Once the cavalries started to be slaughtered, some nations ordered for them to retreat, while other nations sent in more cavalries in order to save their comrades who were in danger. For the second time, the withdrawing cavalries and the advancing calvaries collided against one another.</p><p>\n\tThe screams coming from the enemy troops could be heard from even here. A countless number of corpses were sprawled out over the plain that had, at some point, become a mud flat, and heavy rain struck down on those bodies from above. This lady, having even forgotten about commanding her own troops momentarily, merely watched in astonishment as the fighting power of the enemy’s mighty cavalry melted away.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ Buuuuuu.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tI wonder if they were unable to bear and witness the situation any longer.</p><p>\n\tSeveral horns, sounding the charge, echoed from all over the Crusaders’ encampment.  In that same moment, infantries, in a tremendous amount that cannot possibly be compared to the small number of cavalries, advanced forward.</p><p>\n\tAlthough each flag was from a different nation, the flags were all heading towards a single location, to Farnese’s unit. In order to save their cavalry, and in order to get revenge on the despicable slaughterer, the commanders of the Crusaders had finally sent in all of their infantry troops. Even if it was difficult to see due to the heavy rain, it appeared as if their military strength was about 50,000.</p><p>\n\tCertainly, one could only lose if faced against that massive number of military strength. Farnese’s troops finally started to withdraw. Leaving alone the floundering cavalry, who were still stuck in the mire, Farnese’s unit slowly drew back.</p><p>\n\tIn Farnese’s point of view, it must have been a bitter retreat since it was as if she were handing a fish, which she had already caught completely, to the enemy. As if they had become fired up by the fact that Farnese’s unit was retreating, the infantrymen of the Crusaders became even more elated and continued their advance. Farnese’s troops slowly retreated further into the rear, and the infantrymen of the Crusaders slowly entered deeper into our side.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tOne moment.</p><p>\n\tWas it truly a bitter retreat?</p><p>\n\tA lightning-like realization struck this lady’s head. This lady unintentionally let out a gasp.</p><p>\n\t“It cannot be!”</p><p>\n\tIf this was what she was aiming for from the very beginning, then that Farnese girl was truly a preposterous monster. There was no way. But. But, if one were to look over the course of events of the battlefield once more, then without a doubt, it had met the conditions. Regardless of whether Farnese had intended this or not, the order that this lady must give was incredibly obvious!</p><p>\n\t“All forces!”</p><p>\n\tThis lady raised her fan and commanded.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“Spread out our forces! Spread it out as wide as possible! From this point forth, our troops shall become the left wing of a crane wing formation and encircle the enemy forces from the left side!”</p><p>\n\t“Hm? What’s wrong all of a sudden, sis?”</p><p>\n\tSitri, who was preparing for battle, tilted her head. As always, she had a naive face which also only contained a quizzical look as if she were unable to understand the situation that well. This lady explained urgently, however, while also fully being cautious to not be impatient.</p><p>\n\t“Look over there. Farnese’s unit is retreating. The infantrymen of the Crusaders are doing their all in order to chase after her. If Farnese is able to properly lure in all of the enemy infantrymen.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tIt was then that Sitri’s eyes started to shine amusingly.</p><p>\n\t“Heeeh. A bottleneck state will take place. Only a single unit is retreating, but since there are a countless number of troops chasing after them, they’ll naturally gather into a single spot.”</p><p>\n\tThat was it!</p><p>\n\tTruly, Sitri was normally a peerlessly dull girl, but when the topic became related to battle, she would transform into a completely different person who was also very sharp. This lady, while her mind was still blazing, ordered once more.</p><p>\n\t“Everyone prepare to carry out an encirclement battle of annihilation!”</p><p>\n\tMost certainly, even Barbatos must have realized the real intention behind the situation that was unfolding right before us. Since that child, regardless of other things, was at least gifted with a damn sharp instinct when it came to war!</p><p>\n\tIf Barbatos spreads out the right wing and this lady spreads out the left wing, then Farnese will lure the enemy in on her own into the encirclement. This was a race against time. If we are able to complete the encirclement before Farnese can be pierced by the enemy’s advance, then it will be our outright victory. If the enemy forces are able to crush Farnese before we are able to complete the encirclement, then it will be our utter defeat. An outright victory or an utter defeat. Although this lady does not have a hobby of gambling, it was in a moment like this where it was a military commander’s duty to make a wager!</p><p>\n\tThe streaks of rain were becoming thicker. Due to the wet fog and heavy rain, everyone’s fields of vision were starting to narrow slowly. This was good fortune, as well. The chances of the enemies being unable to notice us completing the encirclement on our side rises. Moreover, if they are blinded by military merit then this battle, there is a chance of winning!</p><p>\n\tThis lady hurried the captains once more.</p><p>\n\t“Everyone, there is no time to hesitate. We must quickly⎯⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p><strong>▯</strong><strong>Demon Lord of Immortality, Rank 8th, Barbatos</strong></p><p><strong>\t Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 7</strong></p><p><strong>\t Bruno Plains, The Right Wing of the Army of the Crescent Alliance</strong></p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t“⎯⎯⎯⎯Quickly spread out our forces already! You damn wusses!”</p><p>\n\tWhile personally kicking the butts of my subordinates, I shouted in a loud voice. Although, as much as this was a tactic that we didn’t plan beforehand, so the soldiers were showing just as much confusion, fuck, this wasn’t the time to quibble over something like that. There was a need to move quickly even if it meant I had to hit these clumsy simpletons in the balls!</p><p>\n\t“Y-Your Excellency. My apologies, but if you can provide us with the reason.”</p><p>\n\t“If those are eyes attached to that mug of yours, then look for yourself, you bastard.”</p><p>\n\tI grabbed him by his collar and forced his gaze towards the front line.</p><p>\n\t“What do you see past that human girl’s troops?”</p><p>\n\t“I-I see a lot of enemy infantrymen?”</p><p>\n\t“That’s right. Not just a lot of infantrymen, but infantrymen that are approaching fucking recklessly while concentrated in a single spot. We’re also a mess, but those humans are even more of a mess than we are. They have no other choice but to be like that since they have a commander for each nation.”</p><p>\n\tSmack, I hit his cheek.</p><p>\n\t“Now here’s a question. Infantrymen are approaching us while concentrated in a single point. They’re so concentrated that they can barely even raise their swords properly. Moreover, they’re also blinded by the desire to take that human girl’s head. Conveniently, it seems we’re standing at the right wing? What should we do then, Mr. Stonehead?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tMy stupid subordinate slowly opened his eyes wide.</p><p>\n\t“We have to encircle them, Your Excellency.”</p><p>\n\t“That’s right, you dullard. One plus one equals two, and the enemy infantrymen, that are pursuing into our side because they’ve been blinded by military merit, are prey that we have to shatter completely. If you understand, then hurry up and spread out in a crane wing formation. Okay? We’ll become the right wing of the crane wing formation and wrap up those idiotic human armies.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“But, Your Excellency. An encirclement cannot be completed if we are the only ones to move. Those Mountain Faction fellows, who are handling the left side, must also go along with this plan in order for us.”</p><p>\n\tI struck my subordinate’s cheek once more.</p><p>\n\t“Paimon may be a crazy bitch, but she isn’t an incompetent bitch. If that bitch was actually incompetent, then her head would have been severed by my hands a long time ago. Fuck, we’ve been on 6 Crescent Alliance expeditions together, and the number of times we’ve gone to civil war against one another is 14! At the very least, her wit is much better than yours so stop worrying about others⎯⎯⎯⎯Idiots! What are you doing!? Move quickly!”</p><p>\n\tSlaaap.</p><p>\n\tI struck my subordinate’s cheek for the final time.</p><p>\n\tOnly then did everyone collect themselves before they proceeded to hastily move the troops. Shouts echoed from here and there and messengers moved busily. As it always has been, and as it always will be, a battle of encirclement was a fight against time. If we’re late, then our center army will be breached and thus result in us being torn apart instead. This was an optimum opportunity.</p><p>\n\tBut.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tI didn’t like this.</p><p>\n\tIf perhaps, this encirclement battle of annihilation were to succeed, then that would make it so that that human child had commanded and controlled this battle from start to finish. Was that possible? It was impossible for even me, who has been referred to as a brave general for hundreds of years and praised as courageous, to perform such a stunt. In the first place, in order for that kind of feat to be possible, <strong>one</strong><strong>must be gifted with something different</strong>.</p><p>\n\tDantalian.</p><p>\n\tYou, just what sort of monster have you raised!?</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p><strong>▯</strong><strong>King’s Beloved Sword, Human, Laura De Farnese</strong></p><p><strong>\t Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 7</strong></p><p><strong>\t Bruno Plains, The Center of the Army of the Crescent Alliance</strong></p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tThe battle had entered into its final stage. Everything was flowing smoothly.</p><p>\n\tOur side was able to encircle the enemy troops on three fronts. Although the enemy soldiers did their best to breach our center, it was pointless. There was a time where we were almost pushed back, but my troops were elites. We regained our formation in a matter of moments and retaliated. It was safe to say that half the progress of battle was now over.</p><p>\n\t“Mm.”</p><p>\n\tDemon Lord Barbatos and Demon Lord Paimon. The commanders of both respective wings have just now finished the crane wing formation. With this, our forces’ superiority has been placed on an unshakeable foundation.</p><p>\n\tIf the enemy still had their entire cavalry, then they could have been able to aim for a turnabout. However, the majority of the enemy cavalries were used up during the initial phase of the battle. Not only that but a massive wall of mud had formed behind them, so even the enemy infantries’ escape route had been sealed. Now the enemy forces were unable to move forward, left, right, or backward. This situation was what it meant to be surrounded on all sides.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ Wooooosh.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tThe heavy rain continued to pour while not showing any signs of it stopping anytime soon. The visibility of the battlefield was becoming enshrouded. This young lady’s line of vision was unable to stretch out far and was forced to stop by the obstruction of the rain. At each and every location this young lady’s vision stopped, an enemy’s corpse was sprawled there. It was a spasm-like death, and it was a life that felt as if someone were shaking off their disgust.</p><p>\n\tThe witches giggled while taking in the rain.</p><p>\n\t“A masterpiece. This is a masterpiece. Look. Humans are dying off while swimming in waters of shit. A scenery like this is hard to find!”</p><p>\n\t“Yup, ever since we started to follow Lord Dantalian around, every single day has been so enjoyable that it’s troubling to live. There are many occasions of witches lamenting because of the fact that it’s difficult for them to die, but an occasion where they lament because it’s difficult for them to live is rare. In that regard, Lord Dantalian is quite the big shot.”</p><p>\n\t“His lower tool is a big shot, too.”</p><p>\n\t“Waaait a second. Everyone stop. How do you know thaaat? If I’m not misunderstanding, then that tone almost sounds as if you’ve seen master’s naked body before.”</p><p>\n\t“No no, big sis Humbaba. That’s a misunderstanding. No matter how much we latch onto His Greater Being and beg of him to let us have a taste, he never bestows upon us his royal grace. However, in terms of observation and not watching directly, we were able to look at it a couple of times before. Fortunately, we were more or less able to observe master’s tool.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“That means you stole a look!”</p><p>\n\t“Is there a problem with that?”</p><p>\n\t“Pillage the things we can’t have and peek at the things we can’t see. That’s the honorable pride of us witches.”</p><p>\n\t“If I recall correctly, then we’re master’s Royal Guard, and if I haven’t gone insane, then the duty of the Royal Guard is to safely protect master’s royal body, right? But when you bitches are near master, far from his royal body being safe, is this feeling that his royal body falls even further into danger just my imagination?”</p><p>\n\t“That’s your imagination.”</p><p>\n\t“An outrageous misunderstanding.”</p><p>\n\t“That’s a blazing groundless rumor.”</p><p>\n\t“You terribly insane bitches! I love you, my sisters!”</p><p>\n\tAhahah, the Captain of the Royal Guard turned this way while laughing.</p><p>\n\t“Your Excellency, Acting Generaaal, please give us the final order. We are, at all times, ready to rush out and slaughter those people. This will be easier than, well, just hunting a bunch of turkeys.”</p><p>\n\tA command to charge, is it?</p><p>\n\tThose words mean that the captain wishes to annihilate the enemy forces. That was not strange. As long as you have stepped out into battle, it was obvious to long for victory, and as long as you were achieving victory, it was reasonable to desire a complete victory or a great victory. However, battle meant something else for this young lady. It was art and music.</p><p>\n\tThe flower of battle did not come from obtaining victory or defeat. The cries of the soldiers when victory approached, and the anguish of the soldiers when defeat was right at their doorsteps. It was those voices that sublimated war into music.</p><p>\n\tIn order for life to become a single melody, it must cross over a countless number of gaps. However, in a battleground, each and every life became a melody and a tune. Whether one could understand this or not, that was the decisive difference between the witches and this young lady.</p><p>\n\t“Your Excellency?”</p><p>\n\tThis young lady did not respond to the Captain of the Royal Guard’s prodding. Instead, this young lady shut her eyes further and listened to the surroundings a bit more carefully.</p><p>\n\tNow then, listen well.</p><p>\n\tTo the tune in the center of the clamor of raindrops falling down onto the muddy water, the melody that distinctly flows between that sound of water⎯⎯⎯⎯.</p><p>\n\t\"Damn it. Move! I said move aside!\"</p><p>\n\t\"You son of a bitch, there's no place to move so what do you expect me to—.\"</p><p>\n\t\"Save me!\"</p><p>\n\t\"Do not yield!

With the heart inherited from His Lordship and with the head given to this young lady by His Lordship, this young lady was narrowly able to recognize that beauty.</p><p>\n\tAlthough this young lady was cold all the way to her inner bones due to the icy rain, since the inner flesh of this young lady’s body was already filled to the brim with a pleasant feeling, the cold shivering had no way to replace this young lady’s shivering and there were no other gaps for it to fill, either. By shuddering, this young lady was complete.</p><p>\n\tAh.</p><p>\n\tThis young lady did not open her eyes, she could not bear to do so since she did not wish to escape from this dark joy. This young lady wished to remain here a little while longer before departing.</p><p>\n\tVictory and defeat had no meaning whatsoever to this young lady. Solely the screams of death, the screams to live, and the moans of the people who were unable to live or die, these things were what gave meaning to this young lady. Within this world of achromatic colors, solely those vibrations were life, death, and music, all at the same time. During the days this young lady spent reading only history books within a dust-covered library of a small room, this young lady was incapable of knowing this pleasure. The delight of performing with the life and death of tens of thousands by herself. If His Lordship had not informed this young lady of it, then she would have most likely been forever oblivious.</p><p>\n\t“Uhm, Your Excellency? You have to give the order to charge in order for.”</p><p>\n\t“Our troops shall not move.”</p><p>\n\t“Paaardon?”</p><p>\n\tHow noisy. Do not make a retort needlessly, witch. Does unnecessary noise not get mixed in while this young lady is trying to appreciate this long-awaited moment of tens of thousands of melodies?</p><p>\n\tThere is only a single reason why your head is still attached to your neck. It is because His Lordship had welcomed you as his family. This young lady was not unaware of His Lordship’s image of Miss Lapis as the mother, himself as the father, and his desire for this young lady to lead her sisters, the witches, as the eldest sister of the family. That was why this young lady was taking care of you troublemakers, who were unknowledgeable of military discipline, with sisterly affection.</p><p>\n\tThis young lady narrowly opened her eyes.</p><p>\n\t“I said that we shall not move our forces. Advancing lightly right now is not advisable. Captain, can you not hear it?”</p><p>\n\tThis young lady raised her finger and pointed towards the enemy soldiers who were encircled and being slaughtered up ahead. The captain followed this young lady’s gesture and turned her head. Although the two of us were looking at the same place, it was evident that we were not seeing the same thing.</p><p>\n\t“This young lady can hear Franconian. This young lady can hear the language of Batavia. As this young lady can hear the dialect of Sardinia, the sound of Teutonic can be heard as well. The thing that gets mixed in occasionally is most likely Polish-Lithuanian. ⎯⎯⎯⎯However, there is no language of Habsburg. The words that are spoken by the people of Habsburg, the nation that is led by the Imperial Princess known as Elizabeth, solely that cannot be heard.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tThe Captain of the Royal Guard, Humbaba, tilted her head.</p><p>\n\t“All this one can hear with her ears is the clutter of screaming. My God. Is Your Excellency able to hear all of that? You can understand every single language that exists on the continent? That’s amazing.”</p><p>\n\tThis young lady clicked her tongue. This was why words did not get through.</p><p>\n\tMastering every primary language was a study that people must do rudimentally as they live. It was obvious. If you did not, then you would be unable to read books. This was something His Lordship agreed to, as well.</p><p>\n\t“Captain, although this young lady is grateful for your kind words, there is no need for you to once again remind this young lady of her prominence. This young lady being smart and you being foolish is not the issue. There is a necessity to pay attention to another fact right now.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“Master and servant really do resemble one another. There’s a reason behind everything master does. He didn’t put aside the other races and appoint a human into his acting general without reason.”</p><p>\n\tThe captain muttered. Judging from the atmosphere, it seems she had just wrapped this young lady and His Lordship into one and insulted us together, but it was not something that this young lady was unable to understand. Essentially, geniuses were bound to receive the envy and jealousy from the mediocrity. This young lady magnanimously accepted the captain’s overgrown personality.</p><p>\n\t“And sooo? Oh, prominent Your Excellency Acting General. Why should the likes of us not execute a charge just because the language of Habsburg isn’t mixed with the rambling of those low people?”</p><p>\n\t“I will say it again. This young lady is a genius. In regards to language, music, and military affairs, this young lady boasts her unrivaled capabilities. This fact is evident if you look at how this young lady had controlled this battlefield of 200,000 soldiers, adding the enemy and ally troops together, with merely 7,000 officers and men.”</p><p>\n\t“Yes, yes. Even this one, before becoming ignoble, was once held in high expectation as a mage that was going to shoulder the next generation. So what?”</p><p>\n\t“Sincerely, it seems you are unable to make any sense of what this young lady says. Think about it. Did His Lordship not warn this young lady, who was like that, to <strong>never fight against</strong> the Imperial Princess Elizabeth?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tCaptain Humbaba frowned. Surely. It seems she was still unable to understand. At this point, since it had leaped over the degree of disturbing one’s music appreciation, and had entered the level of having completely ruined the concert, this young lady was displeased. However, this young lady kindly divulged her foolish younger sister with the self-evident truth.</p><p>\n\t“Captain. You have been with His Lordship ever since this young lady had been held as a slave, is that not so?”</p><p>\n\t“Yes. That’s right.”</p><p>\n\t“Before His Lordship had discovered and appointed this young lady, no one in the world was aware that this young lady had military talent. Including this young lady herself. Is that not so?”</p><p>\n\t“Yes. That’s also true.”</p><p>\n\t“If that is the case, then thinking logically, regardless of whether His Lordship’s preference in women is rotten, his ability to discern capable personnel, would it not be correct to assume that his ability to recognize talented people is peerless?”</p><p>\n\t“That’s right, isn’t it?”</p><p>\n\t“Therefore, under the premise that His Lordship’s judgment is correct, that means that the Imperial Princess is a type of being that is either as smart as this young lady or someone who comes close to it. The imperial army of Habsburg, which is led by that sort of outstanding individual, is <strong>coincidentally</strong> not within that encirclement. What could that mean? Do you think that the Imperial Princess suddenly felt bored and decided to take her entire army to go on a walk?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Do not only believe in the things you can see, Captain. A battlefield is a place where you fight utilizing the things which you cannot see as much as you do with the things you can. During this time of all times where everyone’s fields of vision are narrowed by wet fog⎯⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>\n\tThis young lady turned her gaze.</p><p>\n\tPast the earth and the sky where rain streaks fell, this young lady predicted that something was approaching. It was not similar to that of a mere prophetic feeling. This young lady had an intuition that was capable of jumping to a conclusion immediately if provided with properly established grounds.</p><p>\n\t“⎯⎯⎯⎯It is impossible for an individual with a talent that is as impressive as this young lady’s, to miss this opportunity.”</p><p>\n\tThe Imperial Princess Elizabeth had been waiting.</p><p>\n\tWhile making the rain into a natural curtain.</p><p>\n\tFor this moment where she could ascend as a hero by herself in this battleground where defeat seemed certain.</p><p>\n\tShortly after, this young lady’s intuition had hit the mark. They appeared like ghosts riding on warhorses, breaching through the streaks of rain, and struck at the left and right wings of our friendly forces. The cavalry that charged with fluttering purple mantles were, without a doubt, the imperial army of Habsburg. The forces of the Crescent Alliance on both wings did not expect that the enemy armies would still have cavalry troops left, resulting in them being assaulted from the rear without being able to show much of a resistance.</p><p>\n\t“Ah.”</p><p>\n\tA gasp flowed out from the captain’s lips. A scenery that could only be described by the sporadic utterance of ‘Ah’, but barely at that, unfolded before us. The outer area of the Crescent Alliance, that had achieved a perfect encirclement annihilation formation, had collapsed. The enemy soldiers, who were merely waiting to be slaughtered within the encirclement, cheered for the reinforcements that had appeared abruptly and squeezed out what remaining strength they had left.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tThe ranks of both the enemy forces and the friendly forces were chaotically mixed together. By nature, it was difficult to re-establish a line of command that had fallen once. Would it even be possible during this current situation where rain was falling noisily in all directions? Although Barbatos and Paimon desperately tried to rebuild the blockade, unfortunately, they had already missed the prime opportunity. The majority of the enemy soldiers were escaping with their lives. Past the streaks of rain, across the wet fog.</p><p>\n\t“Mhm.”</p><p>\n\tWith vague eyes, this young lady watched the things that were running away. The ongoing tune of the enemy forces’ escape, which slowly grew fainter and fainter, was pitiful and beautiful. Captain Humbaba blankly stared at the face of this young lady who was in that state.</p><p>\n\t“Your Excellency Acting General.”</p><p>\n\t“This young lady apologizes, Captain. This instant is just the right moment, after all. Please keep your mouth shut for exactly 2 minutes. If you do not stay quiet, then there is a chance that this young lady will kill you.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t2 minute had passed.</p><p>\n\tThis young lady was satisfied.</p><p>\n\t“Okay. What were you curious about this time?”</p><p>\n\t“Yes. Your Excellency Acting General said so before today’s battle. That our unit will not win, but we will not lose, either. That we will only spread confusion throughout the battlefield. By those words, did you perhaps mean.”</p><p>\n\t“Mm. That is correct.”</p><p>\n\tThis young lady nodded her head.</p><p>\n\t“Although bringing forth the encirclement battle of annihilation was this young lady’s achievement and meritorious deed, it was Barbatos and Paimon’s mistake and wrongdoing for it being ruined. This young lady did not obtain victory, but she did not experience defeat, either.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Barbatos and Paimon both must be embarrassed. Barbatos, who had called this young lady a criminal of high treason and tried to punish her, must especially feel ashamed. If she tries to punish His Lordship in a military trial now, then Barbatos’ honor will be the only thing to fall down a bottomless pit. She will be unable to avoid the criticism that she had disgracefully shifted the blame of her own loss to another Demon Lord, after all.”</p><p>\n\t“uh. Wait a moment, Your Excellency. For starters, despite being fully aware that the Crescent Alliance’s encirclement was going to fail, did Your Excellency still keep us here playing around in the center army?”</p><p>\n\t“That is the case.”</p><p>\n\t“That’s a bit troubling. I’m not saying this because I particularly cherish our allies, but wouldn’t it have been better to just go in and change the defeat to a victory?”</p><p>\n\tThis young lady tilted her head.</p><p>\n\t“Why is that?”</p><p>\n\t“That’s obvious. This is a war that has already occurred so, while we’re at it, it would be more satisfying if our forces win.”</p><p>\n\tThis young lady could only tilt her head once more. It was difficult to understand what exactly the captain was trying to say. This young lady, while redacting an incredibly obvious truth and a tremendously proper common sense, pointed out.</p><p>\n\t“Captain. Just how are Barbatos and Paimon this young lady’s allies?”</p><p>\n\t“Pardon?”</p><p>\n\t“Barbatos tried to frame and get rid of His Lordship. Likewise, Paimon tried to use His Lordship as a mere political tool. Therefore, the two Demon Lords are obviously this young lady’s enemies. Even if we do not act, the Imperial Princess of the Empire is willingly offering to defeat those two people, so why should this young lady intervene needlessly there? Taking control of a group by using another group. In any case, if the Imperial Princess wishes to breach the encirclement, then she has no other choice but to attack either or both wings of our formation, instead of this young lady’s center army, which is quite the distance away. So it is fine for this young lady to leisurely spectate as they exchange blows on their own.”</p><p>\n\tThere was no one who would criticize this young lady for being passive just because she had stood by idly as the encirclement fell apart. The one who had decided upon herself to become the vanguard and stand at the forefront, since the initial phase of the battle, was none other than this young lady.</p><p>\n\tWent forward as the spearhead, put the majority of the enemy cavalry in a deadlock, and adding to that, this young lady had contributed the decisive service which allowed the completion of the encirclement. No matter what anyone says now, the individual to have done the greatest distinguished service for our forces was this young lady. If you wish to criticize this young lady, then try.</p><p>\n\t“Furthermore.”</p><p>\n\tAnd this young lady continued.</p><p>\n\t“It would be boring to win quickly. In any case, it has already been determined that between the enemy and this young lady, the side to obtain victory will be this young lady. However, would it not be less of a waste if we were to consume them as moderately as possible?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tThe Captain of the Royal Guard, Humbaba’s face became vacant again. As she adjusted her cone hat, that was completely drenched by the rain, she muttered to herself.</p><p>\n\t“Now I know for certain. There’s only a bunch of lunatics around our master. Miss Lapis and even Her Excellency Acting General, they’re all in a category that’s a thousand steps away from being normal. It seems I’m the only sane person near master. Certainly, I have to be the one to take care of him.”</p><p>\n\t“Haah?”</p><p>\n\t“Yess?”</p><p>\n\tThe time on the battlefield continued to flow even while we were discussing.</p><p>\n\tBoth Paimon and Barbatos’ armies had restored their once collapsed formation. However, it was already too late for them to pursue after the enemy. Time that has already flowed by cannot be taken back. Similar to that, the time of the battlefield, that has already passed by, cannot be grasped once more.</p><p>\n\tEvery war was a conflict that flowed hour by hour and was also a war of time. It was not strange for certain points within everyday time to be erased. On the contrary, that was a common occurrence. Similar to stepping stones that were sparsely connected, everyday time was sparsely separated. Therefore, time to a person who was living while buried under everyday life was similar to that of a person who was trying to cross stepping stones, which was an act where they must let something flow and be erased between each stone in order for them to finally cross. For those people, they slowly forget themselves as time continues to proceed, until finally, they merely end up falling completely into oblivion.</p><p>\n\tOn the other hand, the time of the battlefield flowed in a way where even a single step could not be erased. People who forget themselves when they have already stepped out into war were unforgivable. The movement of the enemy soldiers, the direction of the wind that the flags fluttered accordingly to, and even the smell, fragrance, and pulsation of the heart that rose up from somewhere, one must piece together every bit of information possible and precisely snatch the flow of time. A person who rules over time also rules over the battlefield. Today, Barbatos and Paimon conclusively missed that time. The chance of victory will never return to them now.</p><p>\n\tCaptain Humbaba clicked her tongue.</p><p>\n\t“That’s a bit pitiable. Doesn’t that mean they were just used by us in the end?”</p><p>\n\t“The owner of this war is His Lordship, the owner of this battle is this young lady. Today’s conclusion was a natural result since they had imprisoned His Lordship, despite not knowing who the owner was, and had tried to persecute this young lady. It would be good if they have realized their place now.”</p><p>\n\t“Really, master and the general are the only people in the world who’d tell both the rank 8th and rank 9th Demon Lords off by telling them to know their place.”</p><p>\n\tIt was at that moment. A portion of the enemy military strength, which we originally assumed to have retreated completely, appeared through the thick heavy rain and wet fog. Drenched in moisture, there was only a sparse number of enemy figures. Although this young lady narrowed her eyes, wondering if they perhaps intended to execute a surprise attack, that did not seem to be the case. The enemies merely stood still like statues.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tNo, rather than a surprise attack, that was.</p><p>\n\tThis young lady lightly tapped the waist of the black horse and went forward. Although the sound of the Captain of the Royal Guard, Humbaba’s panicking voice could be heard from behind, this young lady ignored it. This young lady headed towards the place where the enemies were waiting while being struck by the rain.</p><p>\n\tIn that same moment, someone from the enemies’ side came out as well while riding on a white horse, matching this young lady’s pace. The opposition was black, and yet, they were also white. Even during this current weather, where dark clouds were spread throughout the sky, the other person’s silver hair boundlessly shone its own color vividly. It felt as if the raindrops were making way for her.</p><p>\n\tBefore this young lady could even see their outline, this young lady already knew who that person was.</p><p>\n\tElizabeth Atanaxia Evatriae von Habsburg.</p><p>\n\tThe only person that His Lordship had acknowledged as his formidable enemy. This young lady was nurtured by His Lordship with the sole purpose of taking that person’s life.</p><p>\n\tThat girl and this young lady arrived close to one another. As she gazed vacantly at this young lady while on top of a white horse, this young lady as well, stared at her while on top of a black horse.</p><p>\n\tIt seems she had a lot of thoughts going through her head. Her face was void of emotions, but those eyes of hers contained a deeply laid plan. However, this young lady had nothing in her mind. This young lady met people all the time. It is good that this young lady was able to at least see this person with her own eyes, merely this thought went through her head.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tRain fell.</p><p>\n\tThis young lady liked rain.</p><p>\n\tWhenever it rained, the sound of raindrops falling washed away the nuisances of the world. When rain splashed and stained this young lady’s cheek, this young lady felt bleakly relieved since it felt as if there was still an outside in that place.</p><p>\n\tThere was a time when this young lady thought that the various miscellaneous things of the world were tormenting her, and there was also a time when only those torturous things were laid on her mind, but the sound of rain washed those days and that time away. Since the streaks of rain were busy knocking away everything in the world, it appeared as if it did not have enough strength to obstruct this young lady. Whenever the rain fell, this young lady felt as if she were something in the world that had the least value in obstructing. This young lady breathed for a moment during this indifference of the rain.</p><p>\n\tIf it disappeared without a trace.</p><p>\n\tIf the trace of this body’s existence disappeared, and if even the trace that it had disappeared also vanished.</p><p>\n\t“You.”</p><p>\n\tShe opened her lips. A drop of rain flowed down the side of her lips, following the line of her chin. Those lips were most likely lips that His Lordship would want to kiss.</p><p>\n\t“I see that you are dead.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“That is not the face of a person who is alive, and those are not the eyes of a person who is alive. Did Dantalian make a doll into his general? Or did he perhaps intend to bear, not a doll, but a corpse and take care of it? What a troubling man. It seems each and every thing that man decides to take in are nothing but obstructions.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“I see you have little words. Since you are only glaring at myself silently, I cannot see a path to converse. In truth, it is a question whether you are even looking at me or not. What thoughts are contained in that head of yours for you to be so composed?”</p><p>\n\tThis young lady gazed at the streaks of rain.</p><p>\n\tAnd spoke.</p><p>\n\t“The thought of wanting to kill you is going through this young lady’s head.”</p><p>\n\tShe closed her mouth and showed a slightly troubled face. She then narrowed her eyes and shook her head.</p><p>\n\t“I am sorry. You cannot kill me. Not only do you lack the ability to do so, but, regardless of whether you do indeed have the ability to do so or not, fighting against me right now would be an act that would go against Dantalian’s order. Since you are a puppet, you will not defy Dantalian. Is that not so?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“I wished to see up close the girl that man had made into the face of his army. I see that Dantalian is proud. I can see a man who, at any cost, tries to shoulder the things which he cannot shoulder and take in the things that he does not have to take in. How does one possibly intend to save a child who has already died in the past, and likewise, how does one intend to kill that child? Is Dantalian planning to turn back time? Was a person’s time something that was reversed just because someone wished for it to happen?”</p><p>\n\tShe looked up towards the raining sky.</p><p>\n\t“Pass a message on to your lord, if you will. That, after meeting your doll, I, Elizabeth von Habsburg, think she is somewhat pretty.”</p><p>\n\tShe must have finished saying everything that she wanted to say since she had then turned the head of her horse. Soon after, she disappeared into the wet fog and the military personnel, which she had brought with her, vanished along with her like shadows. This young lady watched the shadow fading away within the wet fog for as long as possible.</p><p>\n\tOnly a single apprehension came to this young lady’s mind.</p><p>\n\tThe next time we meet, this young lady will kill her.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p><img src=\"file:///C:/Users/ANNGAN~1/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.png\" alt=\"25x25\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\"></p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tThat day’s battle concluded as so.</p><p>\n\tNo one was able to obtain victory and no one had been defeated. However, one hero appeared from the Crescent Alliance and the Crusaders respectively.</p><p>\n\tThis young lady, Laura De Farnese.</p><p>\n\tAnd the Imperial Princess, Elizabeth von Habsburg.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p><strong>▯</strong><strong>Demon Lord of Immortality, Rank 8th, Barbatos</strong></p><p><strong>\t Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 7</strong></p><p><strong>\t Bruno Plains, The Right Wing of the Army of the Crescent Alliance</strong></p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tVacantly.</p><p>\n\tAnd in vain.</p><p>\n\tI watched the enemy soldiers disappear past the streaks of rain.</p><p>\n\tThe encirclement had been breached. I had judged that it was perfect. When the thought, ‘I see that bitch Paimon’s wit hasn’t died yet’, had crossed my mind, I was already certain of our victory, but.</p><p>\n\tI was not able to predict nor was I able to block the cavalry unit of a single army that had appeared out of nowhere and stabbed into our troops like a fang. By the time I was able to narrowly disentangle the chaos and organize our ranks once more, the enemy cavalry, and adding to that, the enemy infantrymen were already running away with leisure.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tSnap.</p><p>\n\t“Damn it.”</p><p>\n\tAgain.</p><p>\n\tAgain, a decisive victory slipped through my fingers right before my eyes.</p><p>\n\tI had done quite a lot of preparations in order to start this war. I burned down a mountain range, I manipulated the press, and I was just barely able to set straight the expedition that was about to become a failure due to old man Marbas’ mistake. All the fruition, the moment where all of my sweat and blood, that I had shed until now, was going to be rewarded, was right under our noses and I missed it. I ended up missing the chance.</p><p>\n\t“Damn it!”</p><p>\n\tOnly anger burst out of my throat.</p><p>\n\t“A little bit more, if we had pushed a little bit more. We would have been able to acquire the earth, the farmland, and the rich plains where our kind could cultivate and survive in. Just a little bit more⎯⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>\n\tBecause it was regretful and remorseful.</p><p>\n\tBecause of the fact that I was ridiculed by a bastard who treated war as if it were a toy like that, I was hateful.</p><p>\n\t“Your Excellency Barbatos.”</p><p>\n\tWhen my knees were about to buckle, there was a sound that grabbed me by the nape. The moment I looked around my surroundings, my subordinates, my children who I dragged all the way here until now, were watching over me. Their gazes became ropes and were just barely able to wrap around my body and pull it up.</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯⎯⎯That’s right.</p><p>\n\tI’m the pillar of the Plains Faction.</p><p>\n\tThe one to have led the continuous desire of the entire demon race for 500 years.</p><p>\n\tI was our race’s shadow that indiscriminately used even dirty methods if it meant that our kind could pass down a warmer land and a more fertile earth to our children. Not a commoner who laments because the world is remorseful, but a Demon Lord who merely acts as a proxy while bearing that resentment.</p><p>\n\tIt was too soon to fall.</p><p>\n\tWe have only failed in a single battle.</p><p>\n\tSwallowing down the clot of blood that was rising from my throat, grabbing the will that was trying to escape from my joints and nailing them down, adding steel to my apprehension and throwing away the blade from my will, I stood up as the Demon Lord of Immortality.</p><p>\n\t“⎯⎯⎯⎯Hm. Yeah, well. I missed it. Fuck. Whatever. That can happen. If there’s a day where we fuck someone over, then there’s also a day where someone else fucks us over. Although the Gods don’t show equality in terms of loving all beings, they’re incredibly fair when it comes to bestowing fucking misery to all people.”</p><p>\n\tI grinned.</p><p>\n\tPeople smile when they become cruel to someone. Since I’m constantly hard on myself, I can display laughter whenever I pleased.</p><p>\n\t“Zepar, my left atrium.”</p><p>\n\t“Yes, Your Excellency. I, Major General Zepar, am here.”</p><p>\n\t“I heard the cheers when the enemy cavalry rushed in. It was the language of Habsburg. That Elizabeth bitch must have played out some stratagem. I’ll bestow upon you my Remorseful Wolves. Chase after her until the ends of Hell and rip her to shreds.”</p><p>\n\t “.”</p><p>\n\tZepar bowed his head.</p><p>\n\t“As you command.”</p><p>\n\t“Yeah. Follow it well. If you fail, then just die there.”</p><p>\n\tI snapped my fingers. My shadow throbbed before spitting out 7 black maws, the maw of black beasts.</p><p>\n\tCapture pregnant mothers alive and pour curses onto them. Make them into living corpses that can neither live nor die. After gathering 100 lemures of the children born by those living corpses, the monster you get from earnestly infusing those lemures together is my exclusive familiar, the Remorseful Wolf.</p><p>\n\tThere is only one way to destroy them. Only <strong>mothers</strong>, who have performed a stillbirth, can escape the fangs of the Remorseful Wolves. The reason why those annoying witches were able to protect Dantalian was because of that. It’s obvious since if it’s a witch, then they must have had experienced something like a stillbirth several times. However, if it’s the noble Imperial Princess of the Habsburg Empire, then she wouldn’t have even experienced pregnancy.</p><p>\n\t“Beleth, my right atrium.”</p><p>\n\t“Awaiting your command, Corps Commander.”</p><p>\n\t“There’s a lowly succubus woman who always follows behind Dantalian. She should be managing the supplies in the rear. Catch that bitch and bring her before me.”</p><p>\n\t“It is not really my preference to threaten women and children. Moreover, I recall that little one being referred to as an outcast. If a luxurious gentleman, such as myself, were to touch such a lowly person, then my dignity.”</p><p>\n\t“Do you want me to fuck up that lofty dignity of yours along with your entire body?”</p><p>\n\t“Since I was very little, I wished to capture a succubus at least once. Leave it to me.”</p><p>\n\tRank 16th, Demon Lord Zepar, and Rank 13th, Demon Lord Beleth, the two high ranking Demon Lords that supported the Plains Faction received their respective orders and dispersed.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tZepar will most likely crush the Imperial Princess Elizabeth on his own discretion and come back. I wasn’t worried even if it took several days. The problem wasn’t the Imperial Princess, but rather, it was Dantalian.</p><p>\n\tI was absolutely certain that that human child didn’t operate her unit on her own. She most likely received proper instructions from Dantalian, and pulled off that shit, in order to screw us over. Even if there was no evidence, it didn’t matter. My old intuition, my instincts that were trained while leaping over life and death situations tens of hundreds of times on the battlefield, was telling me this. That Dantalian and the girl, that the two of them were plotting something.</p><p>\n\tDantalian. You were adorable since you were playing cute tricks. However, I’m constantly ready to slit your throat if you bare your teeth at me. I’ll show that to you now.</p><p>\n\tShortly after, Beleth returned with a pink haired succubus. I wonder if he had already hit her a couple of times in order to set an example since her right cheek was bruised.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tIf I remembered correctly, then her name was certainly Lapis Lazuli. Even as blood dripped down the side of the mouth of this lowly outcast, she continued to glare towards my direction. She looked at me with an emotionless face as if she were admonishing me. Although we’ve met face to face several times whenever I came in and out of Dantalian’s dwelling, no matter how many times I looked at her, I didn’t like her fierce gaze.</p><p>\n\t“I have brought her, Corps Commander. This, since she wasn’t a spiteful bitch by nature, I struck her a bit beforehand. Tsk. Really, it feels dirty to hit weak things.”</p><p>\n\t“Good job. Put her down here.”</p><p>\n\t“Yes. As you command.”</p><p>\n\tThud.</p><p>\n\tBeleth put down the outcast as if he were tossing her. Since her upper body fell down first, the outcast injured her face. With a face scratched by the ground and covered in muddy water, the one who’s Dantalian’s lover, and also a half-breed peasant, gazed up at me.</p><p>\n\t“This one apologizes, Your Greater Being, but this one does not think that this is an appropriate reception. No matter how lowly this one may be, this body is one that had received His Highness Dantalian’s royal grace and is also the body that is in charge of managing the rear of a single unit. Why is Your Greater Being infringing upon strict military law on Your Greater Being’s own volition?”</p><p>\n\t“I have no grudge against you personally, child.”</p><p>\n\tI grabbed the outcast’s hair and raised her head. Annoyingly, this peasant hasn’t displayed a single pained expression or let out a single anguished moan even once. She simply stared right into my eyes with an unwavering gaze.</p><p>\n\t“However, frustration keeps piling up towards that kid who you received your royal grace from. What to do? Even during the speech, he betrayed my trust, and he used some cheap method just so he could avoid some tiny punishment. What do you think I should do about that kid, who made that acting general of his ridicule my entire faction?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tThe outcast shut her lips. That’s right. You can’t answer that. You don’t know the answer, either. I raised the corners of my lips.</p><p>\n\t“Yeah. I’m the same. I’m not really sure what I should do from now on. That’s why, right now, I plan to visit Dantalian with you and ask him personally. Follow me, you peasant bitch.”</p><p>\n\tDantalian. It’ll be a good idea to give me a proper explanation. Not for only your own safety, but if you cherish the life of this sweetheart of yours who you love so much.</p><p>\n\t“For now, should we do some warm ups before we go visit Dantalian?”</p><p>\n\tI grinned broadly.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p><strong>▯</strong><strong>Demon Lord of Benevolence, Rank 9th, Paimon</strong></p><p><strong>\t Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 7</strong></p><p><strong>\t Bruno Plains, The Left Wing of the Army of the Crescent Alliance</strong></p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tWithin the falling rain.</p><p>\n\tThis lady gripped her wet feather fan tightly.</p><p>\n\t“Once more, this lady will go see Dantalian.”</p><p>\n\tThis was not it.</p><p>\n\tAlthough this lady is unsure whether she has the right to say this, despite being unable to stop the war, regardless this lady has no other choice but to say it. In the first place, since this was a war that was started after making Dantalian into a pretext, it was possible for it to not be strange if Dantalian was the one to lead it. However, even if there were a separate person to have started the war and a separate person to end it, the ones who have to cope with the war in the middle were the soldiers alone.</p><p>\n\tWithin that human girl’s command, consideration towards the lives of the soldiers was absent. There is a chance that her actions may be her own way of complaining towards the fact that we had imprisoned Dantalian. There is a chance that it may purely be the childish antics of a young girl and her arrogance. Whichever side it was, she was an individual that made people boundlessly apprehensive if a single army was placed in her hands. Since she was Dantalian’s acting general, it was sensible to discuss this with him.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“Sitri, manage the military camp in this lady’s stead tonight.”</p><p>\n\t“Is it fine to go alone, sis?”</p><p>\n\tSitri examined this lady with worried eyes. Since she appeared like a pet that was trying to comfort its own companion, a smile drifted onto this lady’s lips unintentionally. Being able to show a single smile even in this sort of situation was purely thanks to Sitri.</p><p>\n\t“It is fine. This lady will simply meet him and have a conversation.”</p><p>\n\t“That’s not it. Mm. In the battle just now, Barbatos participated on the other side, right? So I figured she’d be upset as well right now. Even though it’s only appropriate for Barbatos to die, you wouldn’t really like that, right?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“If sis goes to meet Dantalian right now, then won’t you end up running into Barbatos? You’ll end up needlessly quarreling with her again.”</p><p>\n\t“If that is the case, then more so.”</p><p>\n\tThis lady spoke while putting more strength into her voice.</p><p>\n\t“Then more so, this lady must go this very instant. The declaration this lady made to accept Dantalian into the Mountain Faction was not a lie. This lady had openly declared in front of everybody that she will liaise the man that Barbatos had made into her lover. This lady had no other choice but to utilize a political intrigue last time, but⎯⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>\n\tThis time, it will be fair and square.</p><p>\n\tWhile looking straight at Barbatos, this lady will definitely bring in the individual that this lady believes is necessary to us.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tAfter seeing this lady harden her resolve, Sitri nodded her head. This child, who had always silently supported this lady, put a trust, that did not change even to this day, into her voice and pushed this lady forward.</p><p>\n\t“Okay. Have a safe trip, sis. I’ll take care of things here.”</p><p>\n\tYes. This lady shall trust you and leave it in your hands, Sitri. My gentle acting general.</p><p>\n\tLeaving behind the captains who were depressed because they had let victory slip through their fingers, this lady left. Each step this lady took, there was mud, so muddy water smeared onto her shoes and seeped into her skirt, dirtying her mantle, but it was fine. If this lady believed that there were several drops of blood from the soldiers, who had died under this lady’s command, mixed into each and every muddy pool on today’s battlefield, then the thought that it was dirty did not even remotely appear in this lady’s mind.</p><p>\n\tThe rain slowly stopped. From the sky, which the dark clouds could not possibly cover entirely, several rays of yellow light from the setting sun fell onto the earth. Among those rays of the setting sun, one of them seeped into the forehead of a corpse that was sprawled out randomly on the ground. Not a demon, but the corpse of a human. The lamb, the soldier that did whatever he could to look upwards in order to see the sunlight, which he most likely could not see even until the moment of his death, was staring at the sky with inflamed eyes.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tThis lady stopped momentarily and bent her back forward. This lady’s mantle touched the earth and became drenched in muddy water. While stroking down the eyelids of the nameless subject, this lady thought that the duty of the lord, where they must douse their cloaks in order for them to do the simple task of closing the eyes of their subject, was quite dreadful.</p><p>\n\tRegardless of the fact that this lady was unsure how sullied she must become.</p><p>\n\tWould it not at least be possible to make the resolution to allow oneself to become that dirty?</p><p>\n\tThis lady sat vacantly on the field where the glow of the setting sun had become pale.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p><strong>▯</strong><strong>The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian</strong></p><p><strong>\t Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 7</strong></p><p><strong>\t Bruno Plains, Army of the Crescent Alliance, Simple Prison</strong></p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tHas today’s rain finally ceased?</p><p>\n\tI took out the tobacco that I had stuffed into one of my coat pockets. Because there was no cover, this was a cell where rain kept flowing in. Although I don’t plan to either say that I quite enjoy getting hit by the rain or complain about it, the fact that I couldn’t smoke properly, that one thing made it boring and inconvenient. This year’s spring rain was tenacious and long lasting.</p><p>\n\tClack, I sparked a flame with flint. Clack, clack While glancing down at the flickering embers that sparked shortly, similar to electricity, I slowly reviewed the battle that must have occurred today. I muttered words that weren’t really necessary while doing so.</p><p>\n\t“Ah, this is difficult to kindle.”</p><p>\n\tDo not win decisively and do not lose decisively. That was the order I gave Farnese. If this were still a long time ago, then Farnese would have most likely been unable to understand what that meant and she would have questioned it. However, her current state, which was educated by both Lapis and myself, was different. She should have been able to figure out the underlying meaning with ease.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tThe single part that was troubling me was the Imperial Princess Elizabeth’s behavior. I made my response to her move through Farnese. Whether the Imperial Princess will behave according to that or not. If she does so, then what would be different. In accordance to this, the direction of the war will be decided.</p><p><em>“Badum tat badum tat what shall it be: this or that? Badum tatat tat burn the temples and slaughter the people – shall it be this?.”</em></p><p>\n\tI hummed the military song that I had composed myself.</p><p>\n\tIn short, the ones commanding this war were Elizabeth and myself. By no manner of means could it be Barbatos or Paimon. The purpose of the battle that must have unfolded today, was none other than to inform the two Demon Lords of this cold truth.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tSit still.</p><p>\t If you wish to win the war, then free me from this prison and pass the leadership to me.</p><p>\t If you do not, then you will all one day die to the Imperial Princess.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tA frank and explicit message.</p><p>\n\tEven though you all were out there, you were unable to grasp the war. Despite being confined in this narrow prison here, I dominated the battleground. That is because I am overwhelmingly more competent than you. There was no irrationality, illogicality, or injustice here. It was simply the truth.</p><p>\n\tIt was solely the truth.</p><p><em>“When they die and die again a hundred times</em> Ah.”</p><p>\n\tThe embers finally lit the tobacco. I stopped singing for a moment in order to blow some air onto the tobacco. The ember flickered and just barely managed to start burning away the tobacco with a radiant red color.</p><p>\n\t“Mhm.”</p><p>\n\tPerfect.</p><p>\n\tTen to one, Barbatos must have realized my intention. The chances that Paimon was able to take the hint were around 50 percent. If the two of them were sensible, then they will realize that nothing good will come from purging me and that victory will become distant if they kill Farnese. The two of them have no other choice but to not make any accusations and simply accept it <strong>unconditionally</strong>.</p><p>\n\tBecause the humans have a monster known as Elizabeth Atanaxia Evatriae von Habsburg.</p><p>\n\tBecause, the only people who can stop her are myself, Dantalian, and Laura De Farnese who Dantalian had taken in.</p><p>\n\tI will survive due to Elizabeth’s competence, and in reverse, I was certain that Elizabeth will be able to breathe thanks to my, and Farnese’s, competence. Elizabeth and I were a pair of alpinists who were climbing together while hanging onto the lifeline of the other.</p><p>\n\t“Now then.”</p><p>\n\tHow will Barbatos and Paimon react? Will they rage? They will probably rage. Will they despair? They will probably despair. I am curious as to what will happen next. A person’s true value has always been proven after the term ‘next’ had arrived.</p><p>\n\tWith a mental attitude that was waiting for everything new that was approaching, I looked at the horizon past the iron bars. The tobacco was sweet and made my mind feel numb. I sang the rest of the song while blowing smoke towards the just setting sun.</p><p><em>“Or if we die and die together nonetheless – shall it be that?”</em></p><p>\n\tI was here in this prison.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t\"Did you see it?\"</p><p>\n\t\"I saw it without a doubt.\"</p><p>\n\t\"Are you sure you saw it correctly?\"</p><p>\n\t\"Try telling us what she looks like.\"</p><p>\n\t\"She had black hair.

If we saw her, then we'd have also described the things which we hadn't seen, and if we didn't see her, then we'd have just described the things which we did see. Whether we saw her or not, that bitch will still be a bad bitch, a crazy bitch, and a completely insane bitch, anyway. This is what we determined, so seeing her and not seeing her is quite the secondary question.\"</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t\"If it doesn't matter whether I see her or not, then I'd rather not see her if possible.

A lot of them.”</p><p>\n\tThe gift that Farnese brought while saying that, the very first gift  that the girl who had just turned 17, an age where it would only be  appropriate for a girl to emanate a freshly sprouted feeling, gave to  me, the person who was an existence which was closest to that of her  father, was not something adorable like pocket money nor was it a  traditional hand-written letter, it was simply a mountain of what  appeared to be hundreds of human skulls.</p><p>\n\tFurthermore, they were skulls that had pieces of flesh still attached to them.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“This is a knight from Brittany. This here is the ringleader of the  most successful free company in the imperial army of Francia. That  individual, who this young lady obtained information about after having  tortured prisoners, seems to have had quite the reputation. And this  here is the brigade commander that is rather well-known in the Republic  of Batavia.”</p><p>\n\tWith a face void of emotions, however, as if she were a child who had  returned from her very first overseas trip and had brought souvenirs  for her family members, Farnese displayed the skulls and presented them  one at a time. She was able to differentiate them quite well. Although  they all looked the same in my eyes and were heads that I wished she  would put aside a little, for some reason, it seems in Farnese’s eyes it  was as if there were colorful nametags attached to each and every head.</p><p>\n\t“I see. I understand well that you have a sexual orientation that has  an incredibly eccentric and academical value in researching. Therefore,  can you get rid of all those in an orderly fashion before I end up  vomiting? I am much too normal to accept your preferences in their  entirety.”</p><p>\n\t“Wait a second, Lord. This young lady has yet to reveal the real  present. Be overjoyed. No matter how vast this universe may be, the only  girl who would possibly gift Your Lordship with a commemorative gift is  this young lady. This young lady is unsure, but would it not be because  Your Lordship had done an incredibly good act during your past life?”</p><p>\n\tFarnese behaved pompously.</p><p>\n\tIt was seriously a bit annoying.</p><p>\n\tJust who exactly does this child take after in order for her to act like that?</p><p>\n\tIf she behaves like that, regardless of whether she’s pretty or not,  I’m curious as to whether a man would ever be interested in her. Please  do not live while only sticking to my side, you fool. I don’t have a  hobby of living while a high-performance psychopath is occupying a  corner of my home.</p><p>\n\t“Okay. In any case, that mind of yours, that wishes to not only give  me the news of victory but give me a gift as well, is indeed  commendable. So, what exactly is the real present?”</p><p>\n\t“Hu-hum.”</p><p>\n\tFarnese spread out her arms while making a ‘Tadah’ sound effect with  her own tongue(I’ll add the fact that the action seriously didn’t suit  her).</p><p>\n\t“Among these, this young lady shall permanently gift to Your Lordship  the skull that you especially like. How is that? Is Your Lordship not  so moved that you wish to build a library exclusively for this young  lady?”</p><p>\n\t“I do not need it at all!”</p><p>\n\tI roared and stood up in order to press down on the crown of  Farnese’s head. However, I realized that it was impossible. Regretfully,  there were iron bars placed between Farnese and myself, moreover, there  was also a fair distance between us. My body was obstructed by the cold  iron bars with a clank.</p><p>\n\t“Did you come here while bringing something like that in a bundle as  your first gift to your sublime lord? If you only consider the number of  lessons I have given you, then the lecture fees alone would have been  enough to build a temple. Come here and be hit a little.”</p><p>\n\t“Surely, is Your Lordship not satisfied with these skulls? How  troubling. These are excellent-quality goods which this young lady had  handpicked sternly. But do not worry. Does Your Lordship think that this  young lady did not consider Your Lordship’s fastidious sense of beauty?  Knowing this.”</p><p>\n\tFarnese clapped her hands.</p><p>\n\tThe moment she did so, soldiers approached while pulling along with  them wheelbarrows. Surprisingly, the wheelbarrows were filled to the  brim with human skulls. Although the rain had stopped, the sky had the  same darkness as before so my sense of vision was limited, I could see a  line of wheelbarrows, that reached the very bottom of the hill, heading  up towards where we were. Farnese gallantly placed her hands on her  hips and declared.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“This young lady collected anything that was a corpse on the  battlefield and took only their heads. Now then, Lord. Please appreciate  them leisurely until Your Lordship is able to find a head that suits  your taste.”</p><p>\n\t“Like I said, please escape from the idea of gifting a skull to another person, you imbecile!”</p><p>\n\tThis fellow was not right. Seriously, she was really wrong.</p><p>\n\tFarnese tilted her head and muttered, how strange, how could His  Lordship dislike this amazing work of art. It appeared as if she was  truly surprised.</p><p>\n\tTo Farnese, art meant the moment when life and death flickered  brightly. In that regard, the expressions made by the corpses on the  battlefield must have been the pinnacle of art to her. Although I did  not fail to understand that peculiar logic, I just did not have the  amount of leniency needed to passively consent to it.</p><p>\n\tI let out a sigh.</p><p>\n\t“Are you jealous?”</p><p>\n\t“Mm? What does Your Lordship mean?”</p><p>\n\t“Different to you, the faces that can show expressions freely, I am  asking whether you were that jealous of the people who were born  normally and ordinarily free.”</p><p>\n\tFarnese froze.</p><p>\n\tIn the distance, a flame was burning and crumbling. We were going to  war while burning the corpses. The floating ashes flew around as if  salting the sky, and going against that, black smoke rose upwards.  Occasionally, the prisoners, who had yet to die and were latching onto  their life strings for as long as they could, were slashed down and  killed by our soldiers personally. Crackle crackle ah, aaack  Each time the flames surged upwards, death throes could be heard with a  slight delay.</p><p>\n\tFarnese put those screams behind her and stared vacantly at me. Her  emotions were faint. When people say that the temperature of a person’s  gaze matches that of their heart, then it felt as if Farnese did not  even have anything known as temperature.</p><p>\n\t“I can guess the reason why you are unable to make expressions well.  The more you made various facial expressions, the more your father must  have gotten worked up. So you, as a type of self-defense, must have  decided to get rid of something like expressions completely, similar to  how a forest bug throws away its own intrinsic colors and hides within  the woods.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Farnese, if that is the case, then that is something which you have  decided. No matter how cruel or unfair it may be, as it is something  that you have gone through personally, in the end, it is something which  only you can solve. Even if you were to collect tens of thousands of  corpses that possess expressions, the day your rage and scars are  relieved will never come.”</p><p>\n\t“This young lady does not understand, Lord.”</p><p>\n\tFarnese spoke calmly.</p><p>\n\t“Your Lordship, you told this young lady on that day within the  snowing pine forest. You told this young lady to kill everything which  blocks her path, regardless of whatever it may be, to not be afraid, to  not be restrained by the things which are not this young lady’s  responsibilities, and to cut down everything that tries to restrain her.  Your Lordship had told this young lady that if she cuts them down, then  in that place is where this young lady’s life will be. Why is Your  Lordship now advising this young lady to stop taking the heads of the  enemies?”</p><p>\n\tWith her finger, Farnese curled her side hair. It was a habit she showed whenever she fell into deep thought.</p><p>\n\t“Was this young lady’s treatment too cruel? War is already  sufficiently cruel. Are this young lady’s methods too wicked? There is  nothing more foolish than discussing one’s duties on a battlefield. Or  perhaps, is it because a compassion, which does not befit Your Lordship,  has surged.”</p><p>\n\t“I told you to kill the things which obstruct you.”</p><p>\n\tI cut her words.</p><p>\n\tAlthough she has become eloquent due to having received education in  rhetorics from both myself and Lapis, she still decisively lacked the  ability to go against me.</p><p>\n\t“The thing that is obstructing you is not something like these  skulls. Look carefully. Is the thing which impedes your path, not your  own <strong>past</strong>?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tFarnese became silent.</p><p>\n\tAs if the girl, who had slaughtered at the very least several  thousands and at the very most ten thousand today, was being blocked by  an invisible wall, she stood in place without being able to move an  inch.</p><p>\n\t“Although this young lady does not want to admit it.”</p><p>\n\tBy the time Farnese was barely able to open her lips, the sky had  already become evidently dark and several torches were lit throughout  the military encampment.</p><p>\n\t“Your Lordship is correct. Although this young lady was able to break  free from the point where this young lady had deluded herself into  believing that the sound of the snow was the cries of cicadas, this  young lady is still bound by the chains of the past. And this young lady  is unable to control that with her own will.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tRather than words, Farnese’s utterance was closer to that of a small sigh.</p><p>\n\t“Whenever there is a face that is showing emotions before this young  lady’s eyes, this young lady wishes to lacerate it with a sword. If  there is a face that curses at this young lady among them, then this  young lady wishes to display that face after having lacerated it. By  doing so, this young lady wishes to savor the feeling of life by  relishing in the fact that they are dead and this young lady is alive.  What should this young lady do? What must this young lady do in order to  change this?”</p><p>\n\tFarnese lowered her gaze to the ground.</p><p>\n\tThis child was most likely pacing back and forth in her mind since  she was unsure of what to do. She knew what she had to fix, but she did  not know how to fix it.</p><p>\n\tHowever, that alone was already a large step.</p><p>\n\tUntil just recently, Farnese was a mass of traumas. She had denied  the fact that she was subjected to violence by her own father, she  disguised the fact as a lie while not altering her facial expression  even once, and she would only speak about her suppressed scars when she  was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. In comparison to those  days, has Farnese not become much more mature?</p><p>\n\tLapis said that Farnese was dangerous. I told Lapis that I would take  responsibility and requested of her to leave it to me and wait  patiently. While imprisoned in this cage and gazing at Farnese on the  other side of the iron bars, I ascertained once more that my judgment at  that time was not incorrect.</p><p>\n\t“I was the same as you.”</p><p>\n\tNow, it was no longer the time to dig but the time to lead.</p><p>\n\t“There was a father-like existence within my life as well. Moreover,  in terms of filthy personalities, he was perhaps equal or worse than  your father, never could he be considered less. My life was ruined  because of that man.”</p><p>\n\t“Your Lordship, as well?”</p><p>\n\t“That is so.”</p><p>\n\tI am able to confess since I have personally experienced imprisonment  now. The answer of who’s the easiest person in the world to put in  prison. It was my father. This was not a joke.</p><p>\n\tFor starters, there were no two ways about the fact that my father  was a beast that deserved to die. I was certain of this since my mother,  who had loved him and loved him more until she finally loved even his  innards, had tried to kill him.</p><p>\n\tExcept, regardless of whether he was killed or not, until that day arrived, there was a lot of things I absolutely had to take.  Even while my father was raising me, there had never been a day where I  had starved. Was that alone not something to honestly be grateful for?  Although I was raised by a dog-like father and grew up to be a son of a  bitch, I was, fortunately, an honest human. I had no other choice but to  acknowledge the reality that he had somewhat accomplished his duty as a  father because of the mere fact that I had never starved ever since I  was born.</p><p>\n\tThat was why, instead of ending his life, I decided to be satisfied  with just dropping his life into a bottomless pit. The fellows who  are known as mercy and tolerance, as they call it. It turns out that  even I was quite the gentle and dutiful son.</p><p>\n\tThe method was simple.</p><p>\n\tI secretly sent in minors to the swap parties my father would often  hold at his favorite villa. That was so. Even though he possessed four  or five wives, he still enjoyed promiscuous sexual relations. Was he not  deranged? There was no way someone could not show respect towards that  exuberant sexual appetite. I believed that it was quite the waste that  only I knew about my father’s personality, so accordingly, I had  earnestly set up scarecrows known as whistle-blowers and secured  evidence.</p><p>\n\tThere wasn’t even a need for me to go out of my way to start an  incident myself. Even in the places where I had no hand in, my father  flirted with a lot of women. Among them, a small sexual harassment  scandal occurred in a place that was unrelated to me. Truly  consistently, it was another high school girl⎯⎯⎯⎯there was a reason why I  would assert that lolita complex was a mental disease time and time  again⎯⎯⎯⎯while being aghast, I poured the fuel, which I had gathered  until then, into the incident that had ignited naturally. Even though I  referred to it as fuel, it wasn’t anything special. I simply called them  over quietly and said a couple of words to them.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ Young Master, why do we have to secretly install a camera here?</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tI told them that they didn’t need to know.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ Uh. I-Is this really okay? Can I also trust that you’ll really give me a proper reward once this is over?</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tI intimidated them to silently believe in me.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t⎯⎯ We’ve called together all of the defense counsels, Young Master.  Do not worry. Even if the video were to be leaked, the situation in  which the chairman’s family is also harmed will not happen. The fact  that a high school student was involved is only a small obstacle, we  will do whatever Pardon? Are you telling us to leave it be?  But?</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tIf they had a complaint, then I told them to complain.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯.</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯.</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tMaking them unaware of the things which they had the right to know,  making them have no other choice but to believe the thing which they  wished to believe, and making them do the things which they must not do.  Authority was originally something like that and I had a sufficient  amount of authority.</p><p>\n\tI smiled towards them and spoke. ‘Why aren’t you responding?’. They  all gulped and answered me, who was the successor of the company.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ Yes.</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ Yes, understood.</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ As you wish.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tThe time to hunt had arrived.</p><p>\n\tWhen a lion hunts a deer, they do not become intoxicated by the  distant fragrance of blood just because they had already tasted the  blood of a deer’s neck once.</p><p>\n\tEven after my father was imprisoned and I had instantly purged all of  his close aids, I remained vigilant. I intercepted information and  distorted them. His whistle-blowers were unceasing and for some reason,  genuine reporters abruptly started to surge from the rotten press. Aha,  if it was like this then it couldn’t be helped so I ended up only  shrugging.</p><p>\n\tStay in prison forever.</p><p>\n\tThat was my final wish and my father more than gladly complied to that small hope of mine.</p><p>\n\tIt became so, consequently.</p><p>\n\tFour days later, my father died due to a heart attack.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tI looked up towards the sky that had stopped raining. The vapor  refused to dissipate, and instead, chillingly seeped into the earth.  Farnese was silently staring at me who was in that state.</p><p>\n\t“Farnese. I may have succeeded overall, but I committed a mistake at  the most vital moment. Although I prevailed in imprisoning that man, I  could not possibly expect that he would die due to a chronic disease  within four days.”</p><p>\n\tAah.</p><p>\n\tFour days, barely four days.</p><p>\n\tA time that was much too short to repay him for the resentment that had piled up throughout my entire life.</p><p>\n\tA mere four days.</p><p>\n\tI, who had run out immediately after hearing the news of my father’s  sudden death, was devastated. Even as I was reading the note that he had  supposedly written as a will, only a single thought was going through  my head. The thought that this human, this butcher-like bastard, this  unequaled venomous snake among venomous snakes, had seen through my  entire plan and purposely used a chronic disease as an excuse to <strong>commit suicide</strong>.</p><p>\n\tI was unsure how my plan was uncovered. He most likely figured it out with his intuition. He was a monstrous man, after all.</p><p>\n\tSince heart troubles was a chronic disease he had for a long time, no  one suspected his death. The opinion of the majority was that he had  died because he was prone to death, and it was my own reasonable  argument that he deserved to be killed but I was unable to do so. In the  end, I may have succeeded in my revenge, but I had to live the rest of  my life with this bitter taste in my mouth.</p><p>\n\tGood for you, father. You must feel lighthearted since you were able  to screw your son over one last time in your final moment of life.  That’s right, good job dying. Did you dislike the idea of atoning for  your wrongdoing towards me that much? Did you want to portray to me the  fact that you didn’t have even a single thing in your life that you had  to atone for?</p><p>\n\t“Haa.”</p><p>\n\tI let out a sigh.</p><p>\n\t“There is quite the valuable moral in my story. Do you know what it is?”</p><p>\n\t“No matter how damned they may be, since your father is still your father, you shouldn’t confine them thoughtlessly?”</p><p>\n\t“You fool. What were you listening to my words with? It is the  complete opposite. Do not needlessly forgive the man or leave him alone,  and without fail, kill him, the father who had ruined your life, <strong>with your own two hands</strong>.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tI propped up Farnese’s chin and stared at her clearly. The very first  child who I had decided to take responsibility for after having come to  this world. Although I rarely ever expressed this vocally, I consider  you to be my adopted daughter. Because the sight of your life being  twisted was the same as seeing my own life being twisted.</p><p>\n\t“The people of the world will most likely give you all sorts of  advice. Forgive him. Adjust your way of thinking and change your life to  be positive. Oh dear. Those are words that befit those people only.  They may, perhaps, not even be correct words, either. In any case, you,  have you not suffered things which you cannot possibly say out loud or  things that are even more severe than that, by your own father? I can  easily guess.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Lapis killed her own mother. It should have been the first time  since she was born that she was able to properly meet her mother, but  she simply chased after her on the spot and slit her mother’s throat. In  that regard, I consider Lapis to be much wiser than myself. Think about  it, Farnese. What will you do if your father dies by the hands of  someone else before you are able to do it yourself? I am telling you to  imagine that. Is it not dreadful?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Therefore, kill him.”</p><p>\n\tI spoke.</p><p>\n\tUsing a tone that assured the answer.</p><p>\n\t“Punish your father with your own two hands. Get your revenge and end  his life. No matter how vast the world may be, since there is no one  else out there who has as much of a right as you do to get revenge,  you must be the one to do so. The task which I was unable to fulfill  because I was sloppy, I sincerely pray that you are able to accomplish  it.”</p><p>\n\tAs if I were placing a curse on her at the same time as I was bestowing upon her a blessing.</p><p>\n\tI gave my adopted daughter the answer.</p><p>\n\t“Once you do so, you will be free.”</p><p>\n\tFarnese wordlessly shuddered. That was a natural reaction. My words  were ice. If one wished to digest ice instantly, then they required a  strong stomach and tough teeth. And this girl, who was standing before  my eyes, was the pillar that Lapis, the woman who possessed the  strongest stomach, and I, who possessed the toughest teeth, had fostered  together earnestly. Regardless of whether she grows tired of the  cruelty of the acts she must carry out from now on, she will not decline  it.</p><p>\n\tSure enough.</p><p>\n\t“But, Your Lordship. There is a problem. Even if this young  lady tries to kill her father, this young lady’s father resides in the  kingdom down south. There are more and more people in the north who Your  Lordship and this young lady must take the lives of, so when will we  ever be able to advance south?”</p><p>\n\tFarnese pointed out a problem straight away. That meant that she  fundamentally agreed to my words that instructed her to kill her own  father. This was why I did not dislike children who my words got through  to.</p><p>\n\t“In order to subjugate the Empire, we have to slaughter that Imperial  Princess as well, but according to Your Lordship’s words, the Imperial  Princess is the largest mountain. The act of even crossing that mountain  is quite the distance away, so until that day arrives, how is this  young lady supposed to endure the ravages of her past while in this  purgatory? How are we supposed to know whether it would take us 5 years  or 10 years? This young lady wishes to quickly become free.”</p><p>\n\t“It is good that you are honest. Each time I witness you slowly turn  into more of an honest son of a bitch, it makes me feel so overjoyed  that I might break out into a dance.”</p><p>\n\t“Although this young lady is severely worried since it seems as if  her personality is decaying day by day due to Your Lordship and Miss  Lapis.”</p><p>\n\t“That is fine. Do not worry about it. All we have done is merely  brought out what was already rotten. Since that is your true essence, do  your best to love it.”</p><p>\n\t“Your Lordship has the talent to touch a chord with another person’s  heart each time you open your mouth. A talent that can touch a chord  with another person’s heart in an incredibly bad meaning, that is.  Please hastily bite your tongue and kill yourself, Lord.”</p><p>\n\tI raised the corners of my lips.</p><p>\n\t“Three days.”</p><p>\n\t“?”</p><p>\n\t“You will be able to kill your father within three days.”</p><p>\n\tFarnese knitted her brow.</p><p>\n\t“That is bizarre and inordinate. How could this young lady possibly be able to capture her father within three days?”</p><p>\n\t“You are not going to be the one to bring him, you foolish child.  Have I not told you this time and time again? Please, if what is  attached to that neck of yours is a head, then please use it. Think  about it. Regardless of whether you have fallen into being a slave or  not, you are still the descendant of the House of Farnese. A descendant  of their family has betrayed mankind and latched onto the demons, but do  you think they would sit around when their dignity as a noble family is  on the line? Even if they tried to stay still, do you think the people  around them would calmly leave them be?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tFarnese became silent. You could tell from her face that it was  clearly a scenario which she had never considered. I made a tsk-tsk  sound with my tongue and shook my head. This was why a child, who  learned about the world from history books, had poor senses when it  actually came to something important.</p><p>\n\t“Listen carefully. Listen well and learn well. Quite a long time has  passed since the Imperial Princess Elizabeth had first obtained the  memoria artifact. At that point, the Imperial Princess would have  already gotten into contact with the House of Farnese. Four days have  passed since you became the figurehead and gave that speech, but if it  is someone who is as competent as the Imperial Princess, then no matter  how severe the situation may be, they should be capable of resolving it  within a single week. Therefore, three days from now. Regardless of what  happens before an entire week has passed, the Imperial Princess will,  without a doubt, pressure you by placing the Duke of Farnese at the  front of her forces.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“How can Your Lordship be certain of that.”</p><p>\n\t“Dear Lord. To bring around someone like you as my descendant, I am  the one who is misfortunate. Not only are you unable to think, but are  you unable to listen as well? Kid, are the rumors that you are the  descendant of the House of Farnese and the daughter of a whore not  already widespread throughout the front lines of the Army of the  Crusaders? Hm? Who do you think could have grasped your personal  information so precisely and have also circulated malicious rumors about  you, all within three days? Can it be anyone else than the Imperial  Princess Elizabeth?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Therefore, do not worry about whether you will have to wait 10 years  or not, but instead, be concerned about the immediately approaching  three days. My foolish general, even a week is a time that is beyond  your capacity. Fumbling through a single day and discovering the next  day again, that is the level which you are still currently at. How  impudent of you to try and discuss 10 years.”</p><p>\n\t“This young lady is starting to dislike Your Lordship more.”</p><p>\n\t“That is because a sky is above your sky. I know that feeling well.”</p><p>\n\t“This young lady also dislikes Your Lordship who pretends to know that feeling well, as well.”</p><p>\n\t“Oh? Then try winning against me. For someone who is unable to win,  you must have quite the happy life since you still have some pride left.  Is that brain of yours feeling peaceful?”</p><p>\n\t“Guuuuh.”</p><p>\n\tFarnese groaned without showing any emotions on her face. What a cute fellow.</p><p>\n\tEssentially, the desire for power was something that did not forgive  anyone who was above themselves. I was the one who had awoken Farnese’s  lust for power, and I was also the one who was actually occupying her  sky. Due to that, in Farnese’s position, she had no other choice but to  feel stifled.</p><p>\n\t“In any case, since things will be proceeding like that, keep that  in mind. So even if the Imperial Princess suddenly brings your father in  order to shake your mentality, do not be too alarmed. If anything, be  delighted that 10 years was shortened to three days. Get your revenge  and take his life. And.”</p><p>\n\tAnd.</p><p>\n\tIt was at the moment I was about to add a few more words.</p><p>\n\t“⎯⎯⎯⎯Those are good words, Dantalian. Get your revenge and take his life.”</p><p>\n\tI heard a familiar voice.</p><p>\n\tThe two of us turned our heads at the same time. From a corner of  darkness that was blanketed by the night sky, lively, and yet, light  steps were approaching from that direction. The owner of both the voice  and the sound of footsteps came all the way to a place which was  illuminated by a torch that was near the prison and stopped.</p><p>\n\tPure white hair.</p><p>\n\tYellow pupils that were like that of a lion.</p><p>\n\t“As it so happens, I came here because I wanted to say those exact same words to you.”</p><p>\n\tBarbatos was smiling there.</p><p>\n\tTick.</p><p>\n\tThe pocket watch that was submerged in my clothes moved.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 7</p><p> Bruno Plains, Army of the Crescent Alliance, Simple Prison</p></h4><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t“Hi, Dantalian. Mr. Self-Addressed Genius.”</p><p>\n\tThe night was thin. The rain that had stopped falling during the  evening still remained drifting somewhere throughout the air. Although  the torchlight made the shadows flicker like steam, making the outlines  appear faint, rather than standing on the ground, it appeared as if half  of Barbatos’ feet were engulfed by a pitch black mire.</p><p>\n\t“Iyaah. It seems that life in prison must suit your body well. Look  at the complexion on your face. That mug of yours, that has always been  weighed down by exhaustion, has bloomed, it really has. You adorable  kid. It wasn’t a waste of time to send you to prison.”</p><p>\n\tEven though it was vague and ambiguous, the occasion of Barbatos’  distinct presence fading away did not occur. Her voice, it was because  her voice was clouded with laughter. Although it was easy for Barbatos  to laugh, each laugh was viscous with the thickness which was built up  from within her innermost heart. Every time she laughed, it felt as if I  could see a well that had no visible bottom.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tI knew she would come.</p><p>\n\tMy mind was even ready for it.</p><p>\n\tHowever, there was one thing. If there was one thing that I did not  predict, then it was the fact that Barbatos did not come here alone.  Barbatos had arrived while dragging someone by the hair. My heart  instantly became cold. I wonder if she had sensed the temperature of my  gaze. Barbatos chuckled.</p><p>\n\t“Ah. Her? I was on my way here when I suddenly had an idea. When you  and this girl were philandering a long time back, I gave you some  relationship counseling, right? Nevertheless, I felt like you two  weren’t spending enough time together recently.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tLapis.</p><p>\n\tLapis Lazuli. My love.</p><p>\n\tMy lover, whose pink hair was beautiful and blue eyes were pretty,  was feebly sprawled out there while in the nude and sullied by whip and  burn marks all over her body. Barbatos tapped Lapis’ head.</p><p>\n\t“That’s why I used this opportunity to get a bit more acquainted.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Wow. Bastard, look at that face. You look like you might  accidentally end up killing me, you know? Hm? Right, you already played  around with me on the battlefield so why wouldn’t you be able to do  something like take my life?”</p><p>\n\tBarbatos.</p><p>\n\tYou truly are.</p><p>\n\t“What?”</p><p>\n\tShe grinned widely.</p><p>\n\t“Is it your first time seeing a bitch?”</p><p>\n\tI shut my mouth.</p><p>\n\tThe opposition had a hostage. A hostage was a tool that could be  dealt with in whatever way that the opposition deemed fit. Therefore, it  was a method to flaunt their power before me. In other words, as it was  a bomb that could explode at any moment, it must be dealt with quickly  and I must not rashly irritate the individual who was trying to flaunt  their strength. Since I continued to not show any response, Barbatos  made a long ‘hmm’ sound with her nose.</p><p>\n\t“Good. I like that you’re well-behaved. It seems you’ve realized your  place. Well, since both you and I are in a relationship where we’ve  seen everything that can be seen, I won’t make this long. Apologize.”</p><p>\n\t“Apologize?”</p><p>\n\t“Yeah. Apologize for changing the orator as you please, apologize for  requesting a military trial as you please, and above all else,  apologize for treating the lives of my soldiers like toys, as if the  battlefield were a playground, Dantalian.</p><p>\n\tBarbatos uttered an ‘ah’ and added in something else.</p><p>\n\t“Oh right. I won’t permit you to give an excuse. Something like,  ‘that wasn’t my intention’, or some rubbish like that. Whenever I hear  rubbish, I feel as if the opposition is rubbish as well, but on the  other hand, I also get the feeling that they’re treating me like trash.  It could be my feelings that are messed up, but well, it’s not right.  Something doesn’t sit well with me when that happens. If a person is a  person, then they should show mutual respect. Both sides shouldn’t  become sons of bitches, right?”</p><p>\n\tBarbatos hurled Lapis forward. Has she passed out? Lapis did not utter even a single moan and simply fell onto the floor.</p><p>\n\t“The way to apologize is simple. First, take the head of that human  girl over there with your own hands. Next, slit the throat of this  outcast here with your own hands. Finally, I’ll have to take one of your  arms. How’s that? Simple, right? Apologies need to possess  significance, sincerity, and cordiality, after all. Although someone  impudent like you may not understand this that well, apologies were  originally something like this. It’s difficult, right? Since it’s so  difficult, that’s why you shouldn’t commit a mistake in the first  place.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Four thousand people died.”</p><p>\n\tBarbatos stepped on Lapis’ head with her right foot. Barbatos was the  one who boasted a great strength among Demon Lords. If at this very  instant, she were to put even the slightest bit more strength into her  foot, then Lapis’ head will most likely be crushed.</p><p>\n\t“It’s four thousand people, you know? Four thousand of just my  soldiers alone were killed because of your and that bitch’s so-called  fun and games. Does this not seem strange in your eyes?”</p><p>\n\t“Barbatos, everyone dies in war.”</p><p>\n\t“Yeah, but they don’t die like a joke. That’s the important part. The  fact that a meaning is required in death. With that thought alone,  people like us are able to go to war.”</p><p>\n\tBarbatos pulled a dagger out from her clothes. She then grabbed and  lifted Lapis’ head again and placed the blade against Lapis’ cheek. It  was at that moment that Lapis slowly opened her eyes.</p><p>\n\tOur eyes met.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tAlthough we did not utter even a single word.</p><p>\n\tBoth Lapis and I finished our conversation in an instant.</p><p>\n\tRegardless of whether she knew so or not, Barbatos continued  her sanguineous-humorous attitude. Although only very slightly, the edge  of the blade pierced Lapis’ skin. The scarlet blood that formed was  distinct in my eyes.</p><p>\n\t“I didn’t particularly trust you since the very beginning, Dantalian. Trust has always been lacking in our relationship.”</p><p>\n\t“That is disappointing to hear. I was rather confident that we were  able to pile up a rather nice relationship. Although I do not wish to  make patronage with something that has already ended, I saved you and  your forces once before, right?”</p><p>\n\t“The language of Habsburg.”</p><p>\n\tBarbatos smiled.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“I actually know how to speak some human languages, you retard.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“There’s something pricking your conscience, right?”</p><p>\n\tI immediately recalled a sharp laughter in my head.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ Oi, would you look at that? Dantalian, what are they babbling about?</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tBefore the war had yet to begin. During the time where both Barbatos  and I were in the prime of burning the mountain range, each time we  punished the fire-fallow villagers, Barbatos left the translation to me.  That was because the proud Demon Lords did not believe it was necessary  to acquaint themselves to the human languages. However, was that not  the case? Did she know? Despite the fact that she already knew, she  pretended not to and simply watched over how I interpreted their words.  She had tested me in order to see whether I was trustworthy, to see how  far she could trust me. Was that the case?</p><p>\n\tAt that time, I did not interpret the words exactly as how the  fire-fallow villagers had spoken them. I treated the peasants with  sympathy at all times. However, in Barbatos’ eyes, it must have appeared  as if I were distorting information. A fellow who cannot be trusted  completely. I could not argue if I were regarded as so. However, I  had something to protest as well.</p><p>\n\t“That’s right. There’s something that’s pricking my conscience. So  what? You wanted a war to break out. So accordingly, I gifted you a war.  You wanted to obtain victory. So accordingly, I gifted you a victory. I  have presented you with everything that you desired until now. Despite  that, are you distrusting me just because of some trivial translation  mistakes? There’s a limit to having a narrow mind.”</p><p>\n\t“Hah, stop talking nonsense, Mr. Dantalian. Be it war or victory,  that’s something we both wanted. Why are you trying to act all kind by  saying you gifted something or whatever? Do you want to see a pretty  blade mark left on this bitch’s neck?”</p><p>\n\tBarbatos placed the dagger closer to Lapis’ throat while talking  sarcastically. Lapis gazed at me while being completely unfazed by that.</p><p>\n\tAh, Barbatos. You’ve made a crucial mistake. Lapis was not my  weakness. She was a great woman who absolutely would not forgive herself  if she were degraded to something like my weakness. Lapis and I made  each other stronger. I was able to remain alive and well because of her  unchanging gaze.</p><p>\n\t“Your words are correct, Barbatos. You and I both yearn for war and  crave for victory. Because that is the case, you must not kill my  vassals.”</p><p>\n\t“Aang?”</p><p>\n\t“Are you feigning ignorance? Or do you truly not know? Since you have  experienced today’s battle, you should be aware of it by now.”</p><p>\n\tI spoke calmly. I put the truth that Barbatos never wished to hear on  my lips. I more than gladly vocalized the reality that the Queen of  Silver absolutely did not wish to face.</p><p>\n\t“My general and the Imperial Princess of the Empire are more competent than you.”</p><p>\n\tClick.</p><p>\n\tBarbatos’ body froze for an instant.</p><p>\n\tI could sense that her breath had frozen over. A silence fell around  us completely. The moisture that had formed on an iron bar of my prison  gathered into a droplet of water and slid down. Barbatos was quiet, so  Laura, Lapis, and I simply endured the cold wind silently. Since there  was no response for a long amount of time, I was the first person to  open his mouth.</p><p>\n\t“You have already once been cornered to the point where you nearly  faced defeat at the hands of the Imperial Princess. Although you claimed  that it was because of His Excellency Marbas’ crushing defeat, if you  were more competent than the Imperial Princess, then you would not have  been forced into such a defensive position. Myself and my general. If  Farnese here did not come to save you, then by this point, the Crescent  Alliance would have had even our last remaining plain area stolen from  us by the humans.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Furthermore, you were unable to predict the Imperial Princess’  surprise attack even today. If you knew how to speak the language of  Habsburg, then that makes it even more of a costly blunder. Why was it  that the imperial army of Habsburg could not be seen even though the  armies of every other nation were gathered together, you should have  been able to notice the threat that was approaching through the heavy  rain. Although you had the opportunity to do so, you were unable to  realize it.”</p><p>\n\tI apologize, Barbatos.</p><p>\n\tBut you Demon Lords required some shock therapy. If time continues to  flow by just like this, then you will never be able to predict the  truth that all of demonkind will be annihilated by the humans. You were  all overconfident in your own competence. My role was to shatter that  arrogance of yours. Therefore, I told her this.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“That’s right, you said four thousand soldiers died? That is  unfortunate. I give you my condolences. However, that is not Farnese’s  mistake, that is not my mistake, and that especially is not the Imperial  Princess’ mistake. All we have done is do our utmost in our respective  positions, after all. Barbatos, the fact that you lost four thousand  soldiers today.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Is simply because you are less competent than us.”</p><p>\n\tAlthough it is incredibly regretful.</p><p>\n\tBarbatos, it turns out that even you, the individual who shines as  brightly as the snowy fields do during a dark lunar night, are less  competent than someone else. You may be able to perform a supporting  role on the stage, but you cannot play the leading role. That is your  limit.</p><p>\n\tEven you should have vaguely felt it yourself. The fact that your  military personnel faced death because you were unable to notice the  movement of the enemy troops. The fact that the life of your men solely  hung on your own shoulders and that you are unable to shift the  responsibility to someone else. You have become this enraged because you  detested and regretted yourself.</p><p>\n\tAah, Barbatos. Demon Lord whose laughter is merciless. The sacred and  inviolable Demon Lord who calls herself the absolute majesty, the  master among the counsel of 72 who leads all of demonkind. You were  unable to manage <strong>this era</strong> by yourself. You were slated  to go through quite the cruel seasons for the next 10 years. Moreover,  the individuals who were destined to become the leading actors were  already decided. Elizabeth von Habsburg, Laura De Farnese, and the hero  that will one day arrive. They will write an epic poem about the  continent gathering together into a single empire, and you will become a  song, that has already ceased and met its end, and disappear instantly.</p><p>\n\tHowever.</p><p>\n\t“Let me live.”</p><p>\n\tI was here.</p><p>\n\t“I will give you war. I will gift you victory. I will present to you a  future without defeat. I will show our demonkind warm fields. I do not  care if you all take exclusive possession of the glory and honor,  Barbatos. You all can take every last bit of something like pride and  fame. I wish for simply one thing.”</p><p>\n\tSimply.</p><p>\n\tTherefore.</p><p>\n\t“Spare me and my vassals.”</p><p>\n\tThere was a silence.</p><p>\n\tBarbatos opened her mouth. With lips that no longer had even a shred of humor lingering on them.</p><p>\n\t“Those words.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Can you take responsibility for them?”</p><p>\n\tI nodded my head.</p><p>\n\tLet us work together, even you have a chance, if we all grab each  others’ hands then we can overcome anything⎯⎯⎯⎯I refused sweet words  like these. On the other side of this plain, there was an Imperial  Princess who was going to propine the worst nightmare in history. If I  was going to stand against her, then I had no other choice but to become  a nightmare as well.</p><p>\n\tAnd I did not find becoming a nightmare to be disgusting or see it as  an arduous task, it was merely a joyous occasion for me. How fortunate  was it that I was going to be the one to play that role?! You ought to  be overjoyed, Barbatos. Although it seems you were regretful since 4,000  soldiers had died, I can continue to laugh like this even if I were to  slaughter 4 million people. Welcome the fact that I am an honest son of a  bitch. I shall lead you. I shall take the responsibility.</p><p>\n\t“Four hundred years.”</p><p>\n\tI spoke.</p><p>\n\t“For no less than four hundred years, the expeditions of the Crescent  Alliance have continued to fail each and every time. The reason behind  that was not because you were weak. On the contrary, it is the complete  opposite. You all were a bit too strong.”</p><p>\n\t“What are you talking about?”</p><p>\n\t“Look. Even if we are the Crescent Alliance, at most, only half of  the Demon Lords that live in the demon continent are participating. Rank  1 to Rank 4 do not even take part in the expeditions. The only  individuals among the highest ranking Demon Lords to engage in warfare  are you, Paimon, and His Excellency Marbas. Despite that, we  surprisingly have a massive army of a hundred thousand.”</p><p>\n\tEven if a nation were to scratch together whatever military personnel  they could, it would be difficult for them to exceed a military power  of 40,000. The Crusaders, a force that was created after every nation  had united and squeezed out whatever military strength they could, had  no more than a hundred thousand soldiers. Of course, that most likely  was not their maximum strength. However, if you consider the fact that  demons are stronger than humans on average, then in terms of military  power, the gap between the Crescent Alliance and the Crusaders grew much  further apart.</p><p>\n\t“I shall say this honestly. In all of the demon continent, the Demon  Lords who sincerely wish for victory are all here participating in this  war. To the other Demon Lords, the land that belongs to the humans is  nothing more than a nest of bugs that they could easily crush if they  put their minds to it.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“If anything, the thing they fear are you guys.”</p><p>\n\t“Demon Lords are afraid of other Demon Lords?”</p><p>\n\tThat is right.</p><p>\n\tI have never thought that it was bothersome.</p><p>\n\tBecoming a king was the pinnacle of authority that had the role of  guiding the people. However, there were a whopping 72 people who were  standing at that zenith in the demon continent. I didn’t denounce the  demon continent for being similar to that of a tribe nation for no  reason.</p><p>\n\tThe only reason why this idiotic society still held was because of  the common enemy, in other words, it was because humanity was holding  out. What would happen if humanity disappeared? Just as how Barbatos  wished, what would happen after we are truly able to subjugate the  entirety of the human continent?</p><p>\n\t“It is simple, Barbatos. After crushing all of humanity, the Demon  Lords will, without a doubt, start a civil war in order to distinguish  who has the most authority among themselves.”</p><p>\n\tBarbatos furrowed her brow. Indeed, she was a woman who had devoted  her life to conquering the continent. She had not considered the  feelings and positions of the other garbage Demon Lords who had no  interest in something like justification and merely turned their  attention to their own security.</p><p>\n\t“When that day comes, which Demon Lord do you think will have the  advantage? Rank 1 Baal? Rank 2 Agares? Rank 3 or maybe Rank 4? No. That  is absolutely not the case. No matter how powerful the individual may  be, they cannot withstand the assault of a group. The group they fear  the most.”</p><p>\n\tI chuckled.</p><p>\n\t“Are you.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Barbatos. Paimon. Corps commanders such as yourselves who utilizes  other Demon Lords as your own military power. Demon Lords of Demon  Lords. During the inevitable anarchy that will occur after the  extermination of the human race, they have no other choice but to fear  people like you, who move together as a group, the most.”</p><p>\n\tIndeed, this was a self-evident truth.</p><p>\n\tBecause they know that it would be their turn next once the humans have fallen into ruin.</p><p>\n\tI was certain that the Demon Lords, who were not participating in  this Crescent Alliance expedition, were desperately scheming to make the  war <strong>fail</strong>.</p><p>\n\tThe fact that the Crescent Alliance experienced failure after failure  for the past 400 years was not a mere coincidence. At most, Paimon only  tried to stop me, she has never attempted to mess up the Crescent  Alliance itself. People, who were much more wicked and slyer than  Paimon, were lurking in the rear of the demon continent.</p><p>\n\t“Traitors. We are overflowing with traitors. You accused me of having  committed racial treason. However, something of my degree is actually  humble. It is at a boundlessly moderate level. Although I screwed you  over for only just 20 minutes during the duration of the speech, those  Demon Lords screwed over their own kind for the past 400 years.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Do you now understand why you must keep me alive?”</p><p>\n\tOur enemies are all around us.</p><p>\n\tIn the front, the unique hero known as the Imperial Princess Elizabeth.</p><p>\n\tIn the rear, the powerful Demon Lords starting from Rank 1 to Rank 4.</p><p>\n\tThey pressure, threaten, and intimidate us from both fronts until we finally end up facing mutual destruction.</p><p>\n\tI stuck my right arm out through the iron bars.</p><p>\n\t“We do not have the time to fight among one another. Take my hand.  Let us take the heads of the traitors, and if we have some spare time,  then let us sink the Imperial Princess’ ship as well. Once we have done  all that, we shall establish a society which we govern.”</p><p>\n\tDespite being locked behind these bars, the people who must come to  me have all come. From the very beginning, the people who had to be sent  were constantly on that side. Because there was no need for me to go to  and fro, I was free.</p><p>\n\tI was here in this prison.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 8</p><p> Bruno Plains, Army of the Crescent Alliance, Simple Prison</p></h4><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tGive me some time to think.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tBarbatos left behind those words before departing. The only people  who were left here now were Lapis and Farnese. Once Lapis was free from  the position of hostage, she let out a light sigh as if she did not feel  even slightly affected by the torture she had received.</p><p>\n\t“It seems this innocent one is the one to receive the wrath because  of Your Highness. It has been a long time since this one had last tasted  torture. Although this one had nearly forgotten the fact that she  belonged to the absolute lowest social status thanks to Your Highness,  this one has realized her position once more due to Your Highness’ doing  as well.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“I am sorry. I took the matters much too easily. I did not think that she would involve even you.”</p><p>\n\t“It is fine. This one is used to it.”</p><p>\n\tI gave the words of apology, which Barbatos requested so much for but  never received in the end, with much ease to Lapis. Lapis received a  mantle from Farnese and loosely covered her naked body.</p><p>\n\t“However, Your Highness has done very well.”</p><p>\n\t“Is that so?”</p><p>\n\t“Yes. Even though this one was kidnapped, Your Highness’ unwavering  posture was very advisable. To be honest, this one had worried that Your  Highness may possibly fall into a panic, but it seems this one has no  reason to be concerned from now on. Even if this one were to receive  harm, this one is now certain of the fact that Your Highness will  continue to advance forward. Please continue to do so. This one will do  so as well.”</p><p>\n\tLapis then headed past the torches and towards our military camp. If  she walks around in that state, then there is a chance that she could be  assaulted by common soldiers who have been blinded by their sexual  desires, but it seems she was not afraid. Farnese, who had her mouth  shut the entire time, muttered.</p><p>\n\t“As expected, Your Lordship is not sane. Does a woman like that truly  hit the mark of Your Lordship’s preferences? She is a woman who will  live coldly, love coldly, and die coldly.”</p><p>\n\t“Kid.”</p><p>\n\tMy acting general, who was in charge of my front, had badmouthed my  lover, who was in charge of my rear. In a situation like this, a normal  person would display an ambiguous attitude and try to gain a favorable  impression from both sides.</p><p>\n\t“Mm? What is it, Lord?”</p><p>\n\t“You will never be able to compare yourself to Lapis with what little ability you have.”</p><p>\n\tAnd I was not a normal bastard.</p><p>\n\tI declared solemnly.</p><p>\n\t“How dare you not know your place and badmouth Lapis? Lapis is the  first woman I have ever loved and will be the last woman I will ever  love. If Lala were to say it, then I would even believe a prophecy about  the world ending. However, if you said something like that, then I  would probably just give you a spanking.”</p><p>\n\tI gave her a smooth smile.</p><p>\n\t“How is that? Has the hierarchy been clearly established in that sewer-like brain of yours?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tFarnese opened her lips.</p><p>\n\t“They say that one must not get involved even if a crazy dog  were to bark, but what is this young lady supposed to do when there are  two insane dogs growling above her? Since both the male and female dog  have gone deranged together, it seems as if this young lady is the only  normal person in the world.”</p><p>\n\tWhat is this fool saying?</p><p>\n\tYour bullshit is bitter, my daughter.</p><p>\n\t“In any case, the prediction that this young lady’s father will  appear on the battlefield soon. This young lady shall go back and ready  her heart. If possible, please do not come out of prison forever, Your  Lordship.”</p><p>\n\tFarnese trudged away feebly. She was heading towards the same  direction that Lapis had gone in. The two must be spending time together  in the military tent that was peaceful since I was absent.</p><p>\n\tFor some reason, as I imagined the scene of Lapis being the abuser  and Farnese being the abused, my mind felt cozy. Those broken things  that were in that single spot were my family, but it felt as if my mind  went into each of their broken places and mended them to be flawless. I  laid down on the bundle of hay and comfortably closed my eyes.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p><img data-attachment-id=\"48713\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2017/01/05/dungeon-defense-volume-4-chapter-1/25x25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png\" data-orig-size=\"25,25\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"25×25\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=25\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=25\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=700\" alt=\"25x25\"></p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tThat day.</p><p>\n\tI had a dream.</p><p>\n\tOnce I looked down, I saw that I was wearing  shoes. I knew that I was in a dream by just that alone. It was somewhat  intriguing. In the past, I attempted to have lucid dreams several times  due to curiosity, but I have never been in a dream where my  self-awareness was as sharp as this.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tAll I could see when I looked around my  surroundings was an endlessly vast white world. Only a ground, that was  like a drawing paper which had yet to be colored, was stretched out all  the way to the horizon. And in the center of that, as if it were  something obvious, Demon Lord Paimon was standing there.</p><p>\n\t“As expected.”</p><p>\n\tI muttered unintentionally.</p><p>\n\tPaimon was a mare. Among mares, Paimon was  the very person who was referred to as the Queen of Mares. Although my  love, Lapis, had thinly inherited the blood of a succubus, I heard that  the ability to control people’s dreams was granted to only a small  minority of mares. Someone like Paimon could easily intrude in another  person’s dream.</p><p><em>(TL Note: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_(folklore)\">Mares</a> and succubi/incubi are generally being treated as the same race here)</em></p><p>\n\tOnce our eyes met, Paimon gave me a modest  greeting. For a person who had just invaded another person’s personal  space without having received the owner’s permission, her behavior was  much too courteous, making it feel as if this woman was a guest who had  formally received an invitation. That was quite the Paimon-like conduct.</p><p>\n\t“Welcome, Dantalian. To this lady’s world.”</p><p>\n\tI had a bitter smile on my face.</p><p>\n\t“Excuse me, but if my memory serves me right, then I have never sent an invitation nor have I received one.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon showed a guilty face.</p><p>\n\t“This lady apologizes. However, this  lady believed that this was the best method to dispel the  misunderstanding you have of this lady. This lady believes that with  just a little bit more, even you will be able to understand her words,  Dantalian.”</p><p>\n\t“Oh, truly Your Highness does not change.  Since Your Highness is freely deciding what I will trust and distrust, I  can only admire you.”</p><p>\n\t“Please forgive this lady’s discourtesy one more time.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon appeared to still have apologetic  eyes. I wonder how many people were deceived and done in because of  those innocent eyes. I shrugged my shoulders and went into the main  topic.</p><p>\n\t“Very well. This is my first time dreaming a  dream together with another person. Despite how I may appear, I welcome  new experiences. So, what is possible here? Is anything possible since  this is a dream?”</p><p>\n\t“Unfortunately, materializing every possible thing is impossible.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon shook her head slightly.</p><p>\n\t“Solely the things which this lady has seen and experienced throughout her life can be reproduced here. Like this.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon waved her fan. Once she did so, tree  roots started to wriggle underneath the ground before instantly surging  upwards, penetrating the ground as it rose. It seems the tree was not  only a single type of tree. Certain branches had white bark like that of  a birch tree, and some other branches were encased in a brown layer of  bark similar to the ones seen on pine trees. The tree grew bigger and  bigger until it got to the point where it nearly blocked out the entire  sky. Since the floral leaves were cherry blossoms, each tree branch  shined a bright white color. The world was pink.</p><p>\n\tPaimon slowly stroked the bark of the tree.</p><p>\n\t“Like this, although this lady can make new  creations by mixing together one feature with another, it is impossible  to create something entirely from scratch.”</p><p>\n\t“Hoh.”</p><p>\n\tThis was honestly admirable. Enviable, even.  If I had the ability to fiddle with dreams, then I would be so elated  by the fact that I could singe, boil, and burn my father every single  night, that I most likely would never want to wake up.</p><p>\n\t“I see there was a reason why mares are  known as the clan of the night. My concubine is a half-blood so she is  unable to control dreams. It is a bit unfortunate.”</p><p>\n\t“It may be more of a blessing. The fact that she is not a pure blood, that is.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon smiled sorrowfully.</p><p>\n\t“As you can see, mares are capable of  creating an incredible amount of things within a dream. The lovers of  mares are charmed by that. The most beautiful woman in the world, the  most captivating scenery in the world, a feast of sweet and fantastical  food. Everyone who pairs up with a mare starts to become more enchanted  by the dreams that mares can show instead of the time they spend  together with their lover.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon lowered her fan. In that same moment,  the tree that was as grandiose as a world tree soon started to fall  apart. Poof, as if a bunch of popcorn had popped all at the same time,  the cherry blossom petals all fell while in full bloom. In the center of  the descending petals, Paimon gazed upwards.</p><p>\n\t“In the end, people turn their backs on  reality. An absolutely perfect dream and a pitiable reality. It is  clear what they would choose. They ignore their wives and steadily  throw away their sons and daughters. Compared to their wives and  children in real life, they have a more beautiful family in their dreams  anyway. That is why the majority of mares do not share love.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tSince they will be betrayed, anyway.</p><p>\n\tPaimon muttered as she placed a handful of wind onto the petals that were flowing by.</p><p>\n\tAlthough I could see a single aspect of the  girl who was standing before me here, I did not probe into it. I was not  the person who had to take the responsibility. There was nothing more  terrifying than embracing a past which you cannot possibly shoulder. I  picked up a branch that had broken off from the cherry tree and spoke.</p><p>\n\t“That is an interesting ethnic tale. If  there is time, I wish to leisurely listen to the love stories which Your  Highness Paimon has experienced. However, is this the reason why Your  Highness invited me here? In order to exchange love stories?”</p><p>\n\t“This lady.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon turned her gaze and looked at me.</p><p>\n\t“Has thought of this since a long time ago. A  woman who is closest to being perfect exists. The most beautiful  scenery and banquet exist. If that is the case, then perhaps⎯⎯⎯⎯would it  not be possible to dream of <strong>the most perfect and beautiful society</strong>?”</p><p>\n\t“?”</p><p>\n\tThe most perfect society? What is this woman trying to say?</p><p>\n\tI couldn’t comprehend her. Of course,  everyone lived while burying their respective ideas of what an ideal  society was within their hearts. As I was not unaware of that, I was  suspicious of the ulterior motive that was going out of its way to try  and take out what was buried in my mind. Paimon, we are not close enough  to leisurely share the scenery within our minds, is that not so?</p><p>\n\tShould I try sending a light jab?</p><p>\n\t“A perfect society, is it? Would something like that really be possible?”</p><p>\n\t“Yes, of course not. This lady is aware of the impossibleness.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon laughed nearly inaudibly.</p><p>\n\t “It is most likely absurd. It was futile in  the past, and it is still impossible even to this very day. However,  Dantalian, this lady is the Queen of Mares. A race that sows the dreams  of the night into people. Even if this lady, who held that position, had  allowed herself to have such a pious dream, this lady believes that it  was not something which went excessively beyond her means. Sir  Dantalian, in order for this lady to continue her life, similar to other  people, this lady required a type of bliss.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon glanced down at the flower petal that had landed on her palm and lamented.</p><p>\n\t“Ah, it was a regretful dream. Yes, once  this lady looked back at it after everything was over, it was an  intoxication. However, what could this lady have lived with if that did  not exist?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“At first, it was 400 years ago. This lady  believed that for demonkind as a whole, a society where Demon Lords were  the rulers, was a society that was closest to perfection.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon waved her fan.</p><p>\n\tThe scenery changed. I found myself standing  in the very center of a battlefield which I had never been to before.  Soldiers flickered like shadows, approximately a hundred thousand demons  passed through our surroundings. Since they were phantoms that lacked  physical bodies, they phased through both Paimon and myself like ghosts.</p><p>\n\tAt the way front, there were three people  who were leading this massive army. There was no one else whose figures  were as distinct as theirs. They were familiar to my eyes as well. They  were none other than the corps commander Demon Lords; Barbatos, Paimon,  and Marbas.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ Oh, my army! You are all praiseworthy! You all have truly obtained a great achievement!</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tBarbatos shouted while her white cape  fluttered in the wind. Different to her current self, she was wearing a  silver helmet and a matching silver set of armor. Barbatos shined a  radiant silver color due to the descending rays of the sun.</p><p>\n\tPaimon mentioned 400 years ago just now. If  that was the case, then that means this was Barbatos from 400 years ago.  The days where Barbatos had yet to turn into a necromancer and was  waving around a sword as a warrior. After examining her carefully,  she was smiling in a way that gave off a completely different feeling  compared to what she showed now. It wasn’t a sloppy smile that was  caused by being perennial. It was a smile that resembled a mid-summer  sun, a smile that confidently threw herself out to the world.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ However, there are still many things we  must do! We are the demons of conquest. Our glory is not placed in  yesterday’s victory, but instead, it is solely placed in the future  where our great conquest is over.</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ Cowards say that we have fought enough,  that it is now the time to rest. However, what do we warriors say in  response? Us, warriors who have surpassed both race and status, and have  solely become one due to camaraderie. How will you respond?</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t⎯⎯ It is not enough!</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tBarbatos raised both of her arms and  extended her nails like a cat. As if she were trying to claw and scar  the entire world with her small hands until she was able to devour it  all.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ It is not enough! We still lack too much!</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ More battles and more blood! In order to  make every battlefield, which we have fought on, into the land that our  descendants will live in! Until each drop of blood, which we have shed,  has turned into fertilizer for the land that our descendants will  cultivate!</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯Aah, gentlemen! My proud warriors! We love  our posterity infinitely. For that reason, we not only have no other  choice but to fight eternally, but we are able to fight thanks to it!</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tA hundred thousand soldiers all cheered at the same time.</p><p>\n\tDemons, dwarves, and centaurs started to  blow their horns as they pleased. The sound of drums resonated without  any tune or tempo. Although the soldiers were in a chaotic state, on the  contrary, it felt as if they were a coherent whole.</p><p>\n\tThis was the magnificent form of the very  first Crescent Alliance. The cries coming from the army echoed  throughout the distant continent and tinged all the people of the  continent with fear. These elite troops were led by the corps  commanders, Barbatos of Immortality, Paimon of Benevolence, and Marbas  of Nobility, all standing side by side.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ For eternal death! For eternal glory!</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tBarbatos turned her back and personally went  forward to the front line. Her white cloak fluttered blindingly. Being  driven by that movement that was like a hand gesture, the hundred  thousand soldiers became a tidal wave and followed her.</p><p>\n\t“It was a glorious battle.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon muttered while gazing at the tidal wave of shadows that was pushing out into the distance.</p><p>\n\t“We had seized victory perfectly. With an  army of 120,000, we defeated the Crusaders of approximately 260,000 at  the time, repeatedly. We ruined a single kingdom within half a month,  and two months after that, we completely destroyed another kingdom. The  three of us were certain. The fact that we were invincible. That we  would truly be able to build a nation for all of demonkind on this  ground since we could never be defeated. Yes. We had unwavering faith.”</p><p>\n\tI see.</p><p>\n\tIf it’s the war that had destroyed 2  kingdoms, then it wasn’t the first expedition but the second. Since I  had read the history book, I knew how this was going to end. The second  Crescent Alliance was recorded as the most horrendous failure in all of  history.</p><p>\n\tPaimon closed her eyes.</p><p>\n\t“Until our kind betrayed us.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“After we conquered the second kingdom, we  immediately advanced deeply into the center of the continent. It was  immediately after we had demolished the Crusader’s main force. Split the  continent into two pieces before the enemy troops can reform. That was  the larger flow of our plan. Perhaps, no, without a doubt, our judgment  was not wrong.”</p><p>\n\tHowever, the Demon Lords who were in charge of the supply line in the rear had betrayed them.</p><p>\n\tPrincipally, supply lines were managed by  low ranking Demon Lords. Demon Lords with low ranks had just as little  military power as well. It was appropriate to concentrate them on the  supplies instead of sending them out to the front. High ranking Demon  Lords stood at the front lines, and low ranking Demon Lords supported  them from behind. An incredibly rational arrangement.</p><p>\n\tNevertheless, they committed betrayal.</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯⎯⎯The scenery changed once more.</p><p>\n\tThe brilliant army of silver, which I saw just a moment ago, had disappeared without a trace. Each soldier was ragged.</p><p>\n\tAn army that was unable to eat properly  because the supply lines had been cut. Even if they tried to obtain  provisions through pillaging, the Crusaders were employing a scorched  earth policy. Since even a proper way of pillaging was being prevented,  as time passed, the massive army started to tire itself out as it  continued to drag around its large size.</p><p>\n\tFrom every direction, detached forces from  the Crusaders emerged and bit away at the Crescent Alliance. They were  tenacious and rough like a pack of hyenas hunting down a lion. Even if  they wanted to resist, it would only cause more time to be delayed.  Barbatos bit her lips and gave an order.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯abandon.</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯Abandon our forces and retreat.</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tTears of blood were flowing down Barbatos’  face as she muttered that command. Putting the scenery of the subjects,  who she had led all the way here from the demon continent, being  terrorized and slaughtered behind her, Barbatos fled. It was not solely  her, but Paimon and Marbas as well.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tThat was Barbatos’ past.</p><p>\n\tThe incident that had stolen the warmth from Barbatos’ heart.</p><p>\n\t“Sir Dantalian, can you guess how many out  of 120,000 soldiers returned alive? This lady remembers it vividly  even to this day. Even though 400 years have passed, this lady can  still clearly see the scene where the three of us received the report  from our adjutants together.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon gently opened her eyes.</p><p>\n\t“Twenty-six thousand and eighty-four.”</p><p>\n\tOut of the massive army of 120,000 soldiers.</p><p>\n\t“Only Barely twenty-six thousand and  eighty-four people were able to come back alive and step on the soil of  their homelands.”</p><p>\n\tWithin the scenery of the dream.</p><p>\n\tBarbatos was silently shedding tears. She  was absently staring out into an empty space as if she were a doll that  had its strings cut. With a battered and worn out cloak, which was also  filled with holes, wrapped around her body, she endlessly wept in  silence.</p><p>\n\tPaimon placed her hand on top of that  Barbatos’ shoulder. However, Barbatos was merely a phantom within a  dream. Paimon was unable to stroke the shoulder of the girl who was once  her comrade and simply drifted her hand over an empty space. Paimon  stopped her hand and spoke to herself.</p><p>\n\t“Why did this happen?”</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p><img data-attachment-id=\"48713\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2017/01/05/dungeon-defense-volume-4-chapter-1/25x25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png\" data-orig-size=\"25,25\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"25×25\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=25\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=25\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=700\" alt=\"25x25\"></p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\tThe scene was swept away by a gust of cherry blossom petals.</p><p>\n\tBarbatos’ dim shadow, her distinct tears,  and the plain that was vastly covered with the corpses of soldiers  sprawled out, all disappeared and the world returned to being a white  landscape.</p><p>\n\t“This lady was unable to tell her that  it was okay. This lady was unable to console her by telling her that  everything would turn out better from now on. There is a chance that  this lady may have already felt it by then. That we will no longer  that the day where we are able to fight together will never arrive.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon gazed at my face.</p><p>\n\t“Last night, this lady overheard the  argument you had with Barbatos. Dantalian, you most likely know the  reason. The reason behind why the Crescent Alliance had failed time and  time again.”</p><p>\n\tI nodded my head.</p><p>\n\tTowards the opposition who had, without  reserve, spoken her mind up to this point, regardless of whether she was  my political rival or not, I had no desire to give a cynical remark.  Moreover, the person whom Paimon had shown to me the most was Barbatos.  If she had brazenly belittled her, then I would have responded  accordingly. There was no benefit I could possibly gain from badmouthing  my political partner behind her back.</p><p>\n\t“Even if they are all Demon Lords, each of  their power varies infinitely depending on their individual ranks. If  the continent is united, then the Demon Lords, who were commanding, will  naturally form a large group. In that moment, a war not between humans  and demons, but a war between demons and demons will break out. And with  an incredibly high probability, you will be the ones to win.”</p><p><em>(TL note: You = Crescent Alliance)</em></p><p>\n\t“That is precise.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon laughed sheepishly.</p><p>\n\t“This lady realized that truth one step too  late. Until that moment, this lady believed that our supply lines had  just been pillaged by the humans. Surely our fellow Demon Lords would  not have betrayed us at that time, during those days, this lady  could not imagine that possibility.”</p><p>\n\t Although after knowing that truth, Barbatos  claimed a few good people and established the Plains Faction, is what  Paimon added at the end.</p><p>\n\t“This lady had a slightly different way of  thinking. The reason why this lady had devoted herself to war until that  moment was because this lady believed that the unity of the continent  was the sole path for demonkind. If we can just subjugate the humans,  then the days where demonkind can live bountifully and peacefully will  unfold before us. This lady was able to commit slaughter without  hesitation because she believed that.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tHowever, Paimon realized.</p><p>\n\tShe realized the fact that, on the contrary, if the continent were ever united, then the land of demons will burn in a hellfire.</p><p>\n\tThe fact that the instant the pretext known  as the subjugation of humanity is over, then the warring states period  will arrive and tear the demon races asunder.</p><p>\n\tFor a single emperor, the entire demon  continent will bleed and be split into two sides just to raise a single  King of Kings. What meaning could there possibly be in such a thing?  What was that continental conquest for? If the result of fighting for  the demon race was the chaos of demonkind, then was that in itself not  already an antinomy? Paimon pondered and continued to ponder.</p><p>\n\tAnd she arrived at a conclusion.</p><p>\n\t“Humans, are a necessary evil.”</p><p>\n\tAt a self-evident fact.</p><p>\n\t“We may also be a necessary evil to the  humans as well. We need each other. If either side of humans or demons  never existed, then we would have gone to an eternal war against our own  kind much sooner.”</p><p>\n\tA correct deduction.</p><p>\n\tPaimon let out a sigh.</p><p>\n\t“Even if the continent were to be united or  not, war will still break out anyway. Is that not strange? No commoner  desires for war. If their life and assets are guaranteed, then be it  humans or demons, they would more than gladly not jump into war. And  yet, just why does war continue to occur? The answer is simple.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon whispered in a small voice.</p><p>\n\t“The rulers. It is solely because of the individuals in power.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Imagine if the people could decide on their  own whether we should go to war or not. The people have to take upon  themselves all of the hardships that happen during a war on their own.  As they have to carry spears by themselves and commit murder, they have  to cover the expenses consumed during a war on their own, and they have  to bear the remainder of their lives in the cities and villages that  will be completely devastated due to the aftermath of war. The people  obviously will not easily approve the idea of war.”</p><p>\n\tA heated feeling started to flow from Paimon’s voice a little bit at a time.</p><p>\n\t“However, the individuals in power are  different. They are not a part of the people. They are the owners of the  people. They are fellows who will always bet whatever they possess on a  wager if it means that they can possibly obtain a more substantial  gain. This lady came to the revelation. Be it humanity or  demonkind, as long as society is being treated as the possession of the  people of authority, war can never be stopped!”</p><p>\n\tPaimon’s pupils, that were as crimson as blood, silently glimmered with rage.</p><p>\n\t“How foolish were we!?”</p><p>\n\tShe shouted.</p><p>\n\t“How dim-witted were we Demon Lords!? We  thought that we were working for all of demonkind. We believed that we  were fighting for the commoners. And yet, look. The Demon Lords were not  actually the ones to have fallen. Only a small minority of Demon Lords  bled and died on the battlefield. The ones to have truly been  sacrificed⎯⎯⎯⎯the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of things  that were killed off, were not the Demon Lords, but the very demons whom  we were trying to protect!”</p><p>\n\tPaimon gritted her teeth.</p><p>\n\t“Despite that, we believed, we thought that  it was a flag for demonkind. It was a hypocrisy and a deception.  Even if the continent were united, hypocrisy most likely will not  disappear. In the end, deception will never cease in human villages or  even demon towns. By blazing more splendidly, it is clear that it will  burn that and this side of the mountain range, the human and demon  continents, and the entire world. Within a war that would never vanish  anyway, we were pushing them into a flame that could never be  extinguished due to the single justification that we were authority  figures!”</p><p>\n\tThe scenery, once more.</p><p>\n\tInstead of a pure white space, a battlefield.</p><p>\n\tInstead of fluttering cherry blossom petals, scattering ashes.</p><p>\n\tInstead of a tranquil stillness, the screams cried out by humans and demons.</p><p>\n\tSlaughter, just endless slaughter.</p><p>\n\t“It was this lady’s mistake!”</p><p>\n\tWith the burning world behind her, Paimon cried out.</p><p>\n\t“It was not the fault of the humans who had  become commoners. It was not the fault of the demons who had become  subjects, either. The delusion that an ideal society would unfold if we  led the world and governed over society, that deep-seated grudge was the  cause of every tragedy!”</p><p>\n\tThat was why.</p><p>\n\tIndeed, that was why Paimon had suddenly  started to cling to me. She knew what meaning the speech, which I had  created, contained. She believed that she had discovered cordiality  within the proclamation that I had prepared bastardly.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tDemon Lord Paimon was a <strong>republican</strong>.</p><p>\n\t“Dantalian, the speech that human child had  recited, this lady guesses that you are the one who had actually written  it. A society where a minority of rulers have a monopoly over  everything is wrong. Anyone. No, to be more exact, a society where all  people have authority must unfurl. That is why this lady wishes to make a  request of you.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Please come underneath this lady’s flag.  The Plains Faction, Barbatos cannot shoulder you. You will be thrown  away. You will be tossed aside. However, this lady is different. This  lady is capable of understanding your thoughts. This lady can support  whatever path you decide to take as much as you desire.”</p><p>\n\tBoth of Paimon’s eyes shined with certainty.</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tThis.</p><p>\n\tHow should I say it?</p><p>\n\tThis is a masterpiece.</p><p>\n\tUsing Paimon’s resolve here and controlling  her to my desire was simple. However, if she appeals to me this  passionately, then even I, who’s pessimistic towards the world, would  have something I wish to slightly ask her.</p><p>\n\tThe direction itself where Paimon was  pointing the end of her fan was correct. In the end, republicans will be  the ones to obtain influence. However, in order to say the single  phrase ‘in the end’, just how much blood has to be shed?</p><p>\n\tIt was not on the level of tens of  thousands. It was not to the degree of something like hundreds of  thousands, either. Millions, they had to be massacred millions of times  and then some, at that. Is the simple term ‘in the end’ able to endure  the weight of that blood? Of course, it is something that does not very  much matter to me, Paimon. I am curious as to how resolved you  are.</p><p>\n\t “Your Highness Paimon, I apologize, but in  my eyes, I can only see you as an idealist. I can positively say that in  order to establish a republic society, as Your Highness Paimon has  implied, then that in itself will require a countless number of  sacrifices.”</p><p>\n\t“This lady thinks so as well.”</p><p>\n\tDid she really? Was she truly determined to  let a certain amount of blood flow? Referentially, I am keeping in mind  the possibility that it will take more than a million lives in order to  defeat the Imperial Princess Elizabeth. Have you also swallowed down  that much venom?</p><p>\n\tDo not worry. I am a kind gentleman. Regardless of my benefits, I was sufficiently ready to test your intensity.</p><p>\n\t“Think about it a little bit more. After  achieving the unity of the continent, the people will shed a countless  amount of blood. In order to accomplish republicanism, the people will  have to bleed just as much as well. Either way, the commoners will be  sacrificed. Is that not so?”</p><p>\n\tWhether we chase after Barbatos’ ideal or  Paimon’s ideal, the people are going to be the ones to be sacrificed  anyway. If that was the case, then Paimon, I am somewhat curious.</p><p>\n\t“Why is Her Excellency Barbatos incapable and yet Your Highness Paimon is?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“If you are unable to answer this, then Your  Highness is nothing more than another person in power as well. In order  to achieve one’s goal, you will burn the world and lure the people, who  are blinded by the flames, into being moths. Of course, I do not  personally dislike that sort of thing.”</p><p>\n\tI did not really fancy the fact that you were still pretending to be detached.</p><p>\n\t“Your Highness Paimon, I do not have even  the slightest intention to criticize your idea in itself. I think that  it is noble. However, is Barbatos’ unwavering will not beautiful as  well?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Therefore, if you wish to bring me into the  Mountain Faction, then convince me. If you are going to convince me,  then do not simply preach about the rightness of your idea. Show me your  plan. Unfold your blueprint. Republicanism, that is all fine. So  concretely, how do you intend to shed only a small amount of blood? Is  there a possibility?”</p><p>\n\tPaimon closed her mouth.</p><p>\n\tAs expected, did she have no answer?  Regardless, I was not disappointed by that. Why Paimon, who was my  political rival, had relentlessly dashed towards me the moment the  speech was over, I was satisfied with finding out just that.  Furthermore, there was no one easier to exploit than an idealist  politician who was filled to the brim with desire. This is something to  look forward to.</p><p>\n\tI shrugged my shoulders.</p><p>\n\t“It seems it is about time to wake up from  this dream, soon. As a matter of fact, I already have a previous  engagement with Her Excellency Barbatos. It is fine. I do not plan to go  around and say in public that Your Highness Paimon is a republican.  Rest assured and.”</p><p>\n\t“There is.”</p><p>\n\tI paused.</p><p>\n\tPaimon was staring straight at me.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“If it is a blueprint, then without a doubt, this lady has established one.”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\t“Dantalian, this lady is not only  slow-witted. 400 years ago, before the term republicanism could be  applied to this lady’s ideal, this lady had already established a plan  thoroughly.”</p><p>\n\tAn amusing grandiloquence. I narrowed my  eyes and tried to feel out Paimon’s intention. I gazed at her with eyes  that looked as if they were asking ‘So?’, and pressured her to continue  speaking.</p><p>\n\t“This lady thought that instead of a society  that was like the one within the demon continent, where tradition was  excessively firm, would it not be a bit easier to establish a republic  within the human society? That in order to figure out whether a republic  will work or not, this lady must test it out on the other side of the  mountain range first.”</p><p>\n\tDon’t tell me.</p><p>\n\tPaimon’s face was steadfast. Her sharp eyes  contained the fierceness of a revolutionary who had no doubts about the  path they had to take. For the first time in quite a long while, I was  at a loss for words and merely fumbled my tongue.</p><p>\n\t“What do you.”</p><p>\n\t“The Republic of Batavia.”</p><p>\n\tPaimon spoke.</p><p>\n\t“It is the sole republic within the human  continent. Have you never thought that it was strange? The fact that  within the continent, where kingdoms and empires are running rampant,  there is a single remote nation that claims to be a republic? Dantalian,  do you, perhaps, think that that sort of induced nation formed all on  its own?”</p><p>\n\t“.”</p><p>\n\tA shock struck my head.</p><p>\n\tI felt that a truth, which no history book  possessed and no one could have possibly known, was approaching. While  carefully glancing at me, who was in that state, Paimon gripped both  ends of her skirt and spoke. She bent her waist forward like a lady who  was greeting her partner for the first time within a ballroom. With a  gesture that was detached and elegant in all respects.</p><p>\n\t“This lady shall introduce herself for the first time, Dantalian, the man who is trying to become the king of peasants.”</p><p>\n\tA good-natured smile was placed on Paimon’s lips.</p><p>\n\t“This lady’s name is Paimon. A monarch of  the 9th Rank and the one who had unduly been bestowed the title of Demon  Lord of Benevolence. The representative of the dignified demonkind and  one of the lords who occupies one of the 72 seats. And⎯⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\n\t“⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯And, the leader of the Republic of Batavia.”</p><p>\n\tΟ</p><p>\"Is this, that?\" </p><p>\"They say that's this.\" </p><p>\"Fuck.

I simply thought that it was because  Paimon was a traitor to the Crescent Alliance, no, because she was a  traitor to our kind. However, how would it be if I were to change my way  of thinking and look back at it?\n</p><p>\n\tIf Paimon had already established a group within the human continent  on her own. If she were neither simply on the demons’ side nor on the  humans’ side, and merely moved according to whichever side benefited her  the most.\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon was closely interrelated with the Keuncuska Firm. The  Keuncuska Firm was a large merchant association that did not  discriminate between races and had their reach spread out to various  places across the continent. Adding to that, they had an ironclad rule  where their executives were selected by their skills alone, disregarding  their stratum and status.\n</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯⎯⎯What if, by a very rare chance, they were colluding with a republic nation?\n</p><p>\n\tRank 9th Paimon. The person who loved the humans more than anyone  else and ended up betraying her own kind. In the original timeline, she  was a woman who was criticized as a bizarre whore and an uncommon  betrayer of her own kind. That was the typical image I had for Paimon  until now. The fact that Paimon was involved in the founding of the  Republic of Batavia, be it from even 〈Dungeon Attack〉, it was a fact  that I did not hear from anywhere!\n</p><p>\n\tNo, stay calm. Be composed. Although an excessively large variable  had appeared in the path of comprehending the situation of the continent  henceforth, this was something that I can still handle. Now then. Let’s  calmly get a grasp of the situation.\n</p><p>\n\t“The leader of the Republic of Batavia? What do you mean?”\n</p><p>\n\t“Oh dear. It seems you are finally showing a slightly grim expression.”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon hid her mouth behind her fan and giggled. As if a refreshing  music note was attached to the end of her sentence, she appeared to be  delighted. No, I was certain that she was delighted. She might as well  be bobbing her head side to side and humming a tune.\n</p><p>\n\t“Aah, this lady said it. This lady ended up saying it in the end. It  was something that must not be told to anyone, truly. It cannot be  helped. If you ask this lady ‘what can you possibly do’ in such a  provoking way, then this lady’s head will quickly become heated.”\n</p><p>\n\tWhat was that?\n</p><p>\n\t“Ah. This lady is not blaming you, in particular, Dantalian. This  lady merely spoke in the way which she wished to speak. Just that, since  even a single moment would be fine, this lady desired to see the sight  of your misfortunate face turning grim!”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon smiled broadly.\n</p><p>\n\tA bright smile that did not have even a single ulterior motive.\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tI fell further into a haze. Just how far did her sincerity go and  from where did her lies begin? Her intentions could not be read because  of that fake innocent smile of hers. There was absolutely no chance that  every single one of her words, which she had uttered, were sincere.  Damn it, that was impossible for a politician. Since Paimon was  different compared to any other person I had ever met, I ended up  furrowing my brow.\n</p><p>\n\t“Well, it is fine. Generally, whenever this lady acts according to  her emotions, the result strangely ends up better, after all. The Gods  most likely adore this lady. Behold, this lady was even able to see your  dazed face as a result, Dantalian. It is a profit.”\n</p><p>\n\tOh ho ho.\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon crudely laughed over her fan. They say that laughter had a  characteristic of becoming more degraded the more elegant it was, and  this was exactly that case. While I was listening to Paimon laugh, I had  a revelation.\n</p><p>\n\tThere was no doubt about this.\n</p><p>\n\tAbsolutely not like Lapis, the complete opposite of Barbatos, and  slightly different compared to Farnese⎯⎯⎯⎯this woman in front of me was  also a formidable <strong>maniac</strong>. Furthermore, she was also, perhaps, a natural maniac. A type of lunatic that I had yet to encounter or experience.\n</p><p>\n\t“Ehem. Although this lady wishes to enjoy this moment a little bit  longer, should we get to the main topic? Even if this lady is referred  to as the Queen of Mares, this is more difficult than one can imagine.  Earlier, you obliquely hinted that you wished to leave soon, but it is  at the point where this lady is the one who wishes for you to quickly  leave. This lady’s magic is depleting in real time.”\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tPaimon smiled with her eyes. Her eyes were stretched narrowly like that of a cat.\n</p><p>\n\t“Or should we meet separately later on and continue our  conversation then? You must be quite exhausted after having such a  heated discussion with Barbatos, Dantalian. It is fine if this lady  shows you consideration, you know?”\n</p><p>\n\tThis woman if she thinks she has the superiority, then she was  the type of person who unhesitatingly teased the opposition by using  that high ground!\n</p><p>\n\tWhat did she mean by ‘we must denounce the people in power’!? Are you  not reveling in the enjoyment of authority the most!? This was why I  despised hypocrites!\n</p><p>\n\t“Okay. This lady understands, so please stop looking at this lady as  if she were some insane woman. Therefore, what should this lady talk  about first? Mm. Yes, establishing a republic was not an easy task.  Truly, there was a countless number of trials and errors.”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon waved her fan pleasantly.\n</p><p>\n\t“However, this lady succeeded.”\n</p><p>\n\tThe surrounding scenery changed to show a village. It was a peaceful  fishing hamlet that was placed beside the vast ocean. Even in a place  where several boats were shabbily settled on top of a mud flat, it gave  off a scent which informed people that it was inhabited. Once Paimon  drew an oblique downward line with her fan, time was fast forwarded.\n</p><p>\n\tCitizens gathered, a dock was built, and the dock developed into a  harbor. As the heights of the buildings grew taller in real time, a pure  white rampart formed and wrapped around the entire city like a white  snake. Waterways flowed through various areas of the city, making it  into a beautiful city of water.\n</p><p>\n\tThere were 12 temples huddled up in the center of the town, every  hour a bell from one of the temples would ring and the people, without  having to even raise their heads, were able to discern the time of the  day by the tone of the bell. The sounds of bells resonated endlessly and  reached out far into the distant blue ocean.\n</p><p>\n\t“It took 150 years for the capital of the Republic of Batavia, Amstel, to be built.”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon looked over the ocean. Paimon’s gaze was gentle as if she were watching over an endearing child.\n</p><p>\n\t“We mobilized the wealth, information, and military power we had  accumulated during that time and started a war of independence. That  took 50 years. With the pretext of inheriting the idea of the Old  Republic, we started an extended war. That took another 50 years.  Lastly, with the justification of accepting other races as official  citizens, we started a war of liberation. This lady skillfully used the  7th Crescent Alliance expedition here. At last, after basing everything,  the independence, expansion, and liberation, on the international  treaty, we were acknowledged.”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon silently spread out her arms. Before her eyes, forty ships drifted over the ocean waves and moved forward.\n</p><p>\n\t“A good 150 years. That was how much time it took to establish the  League of Merchants, the Republic of Batavia, that consists of 13  cities.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon silently gazed at the scenery, which she had created, for a  long time. I had no other choice but to follow Paimon’s silence with my  own. Although I have experienced all sorts of things throughout my life,  this was the first time in my life meeting an outstanding individual  who had founded a single nation.\n</p><p>\n\tThe nation was not a normal nation, either. Within the center of this  medieval age where kings and barons still had immense influence, she  had fully stuck a single republic nation on the map. After facing this  feat, I did not have the decency to move my tongue unrestrictedly.\n</p><p>\n\t“Earlier, you asked this lady in return whether a perfect society was possible.”\n</p><p>\n\tWith an ‘Ufufu’, Paimon laughed and scratched her cheek.\n</p><p>\n\t“No. It is impossible.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Even if humans and demons are equally accepted as citizens in the  Republic of Batavia, there is still contempt and discrimination there.  Despite that, in this lady’s eyes it is a bit better compared to  200 years ago. It may be by a handspan. But perhaps, are the  politicians, who are like this lady, not living for that handspan?”\n</p><p>\n\tWith an endlessly modest and pure face, she spoke.\n</p><p>\n\t“This lady is able to say this since she has lived for 500 years now.  Although time is excessively slow, so it sometimes deceives our eyes  and occasionally disguises itself to appear as if it were not flowing,  even now time continues to move by minutes and seconds that even a  handspan cannot erase. Some people refer to that as the flow of history.  Believers will most likely refer to that as a destiny which the Gods  have predetermined.”\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tPaimon shook her head.\n</p><p>\n\t“However, this lady refers to that as simply the fulfillment of one’s  dreams. Because life is cruel and abject, it will always disappoint us.  Thus, the day may come where both you and this lady fall and all of  humanity and demonkind become lowly. This lady will not request of you  to overcome that nor will she ask you to be overflowing with hope and  leap over every obstacle. Just that⎯⎯⎯⎯.”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon stuck out her hand.\n</p><p>\n\t“Until that day arrives, will you not be together with this lady?”\n</p><p>\n\tI glanced down at her slender fingers.\n</p><p>\n\tMare. A race that could control a person’s dream however they pleased.\n</p><p>\n\tAs they teased and satisfied people with all sorts of pleasures,  mares desired for eternal happiness within those dreams alongside the  person they were with. However, this woman, who had approached me,  refused to settle with just dreams and was personally pioneering a  reality. In order to make the reality itself into a single dream and  embrace it.\n</p><p>\n\tI nodded my head. There was no other individual who deserved to be  called the Queen of Mares more than this girl who was in front of me.\n</p><p>\n\t“That is all fine, but I have a single question.”\n</p><p>\n\tThere was one final thing which remained in my head that also weighed on my mind.\n</p><p>\n\tIn the original course of history, Paimon betrayed demonkind. She  loved the hero. Compared to the persona, which Paimon had shown me right  now, and the appearance she displayed while on the path of history,  which she was destined to go down, the two were much too different. Just  how did she end up like that? I was so curious that I could no longer  endure.\n</p><p>\n\t“Yes. You may ask this lady anything.”\n</p><p>\n\t“It will sound like a strange question. Your Highness Paimon will  most likely be unable to understand the reason behind why I am asking  this sort of inquiry. Regardless, it is a question that is personally  quite important to me. I will be grateful if you provide me with a  sincere response, if possible.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Those are quite peculiar words.”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon opened her eyes wide.\n</p><p>\n\t“Now that this lady thinks about it, Sir Dantalian has always been  far from normal. You are also going out with Barbatos. Although it  is not something which this lady should be saying. Mm, the human child,  who you appointed as your acting general, seemed to have a severe flaw  as well. She appears normal on the outside, but is the error on the  inside?”\n</p><p>\n\tI casually ignored the slander.\n</p><p>\n\t“For example, let us pretend that there is an incredibly powerful human.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Hm. How powerful?”\n</p><p>\n\t“The person is simply immensely powerful. A hundred, no, a thousand  times stronger than us. Only the corpses of demons will be piled up on  that human’s path. Even the Demon Lord of Eternity, Baal, cannot defeat  that person on his own.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Oh dear.”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon made an expression on her face that appeared as if she were  slightly troubled. However, since I had requested beforehand for her to  give me a sincere response, she did not make any unnecessary comments.  Speaking moderately, a hero has yet to appear in this era. It was also  obvious that it would be difficult for her to comprehend my speculation.\n</p><p>\n\t“One at a time, that human tactfully faces us Demon Lords  separately. So that human is basically subjugating us one by one. If  things continued to flow like that, then every last Demon Lord will end  up falling in battle. If a situation like this were to occur, Your  Highness Paimon, what would you do?”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon tilted her head.\n</p><p>\n\t“Are the Demon Lords unable to form an alliance and attack ‘that human’ together?”\n</p><p>\n\t“Unfortunately, that is not possible. That person does not lead an  army. They will meddle with our side while leading a small unit that  consists of either them by themself or at most 10 people.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Hmm. In other words, with a gathering of barely 10 people, they are  strong enough to defeat us Demon Lords one by one. So you are telling  this lady to imagine such an absurd group, is that right?”\n</p><p>\n\tI nodded my head. The hero’s party was approximately 10 people so it  was not far from the truth. After contemplating for a moment, Paimon  responded.\n</p><p>\n\t“How about annihilating them politically through remonstration?”\n</p><p>\n\t“The greatest monarch within the human society places their complete  trust onto that human and also supports them. They are a human whose  political backing is firm.”\n</p><p>\n\tElizabeth von Habsburg. The culprit behind picking out the hero, who  was nothing more than a villager from a fire-fallow village, and raising  them to be the figurehead of mankind. It was the same as how I had set  forward Farnese as the figurehead of the Crescent Alliance.\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“Mmm. Is the human society, perhaps, united into a single nation?”\n</p><p>\n\t“That is yet to be the case. Fortunately or unfortunately.”\n</p><p>\n\tThe reason being, the day Elizabeth united the entire continent was after the extermination of every single Demon Lord.\n</p><p>\n\t“Within the situation that you are speculating, Dantalian, which  nation does the monarch, who you claimed to be the greatest, lead? Is it  the Empire of Habsburg? Anatolia? Surely it would not be Francia.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Yes, it is Habsburg.”\n</p><p>\n\t“If that is the case, then this lady sees a path.”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon shrugged her shoulders.\n</p><p>\n\t“This lady will split humanity into two sides.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Although the Empire of Habsburg is mighty, they are located at the  center of the continent. As much as that is the case, it is a nation  that the surrounding countries are wary of just as much. This lady shall  control the surrounding nations appropriately and incite them into  being hostile towards Habsburg. That is right, if it is this lady, then  she will instigate the Empire of Francia and the Kingdom of Brittany.  Those are the places which this lady has placed the most numbers of  spies in, after all.”\n</p><p>\n\tI was quiet.\n</p><p>\n\tSince the words were quiet, my thoughts became quiet as well.\n</p><p>\n\tIn the original history, the hero and Farnese opposed one another. As  the hero represented the Empire of Habsburg, Farnese acted for the  Kingdom of Brittany.\n</p><p>\n\tAah.\n</p><p>\n\tBefore I knew it, Paimon had continued talking.\n</p><p>\n\t“It will be dangerous if Habsburg were to keep growing like this. You  all must actively cooperate in order to keep Habsburg in check. Throw  out a bait, that goes along those lines, and do whatever this lady can  in order to lure in one of the two nations. If both sides take the bait,  then that would be the best case scenario. By doing so, this lady will  induce a civil war between the humans. Once human society falls into  chaos, that would be the opportunity. This lady will deal with that  so-called powerful human in that moment.”\n</p><p>\n\tWas that the case?\n</p><p>\n\t“How is that, Sir Dantalian?”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon.\n</p><p>\n\t“If it is this much, then would it not be enough to get rid of them?”\n</p><p>\n\tWas it you?\n</p><p>\n\tWhile the other Demon Lords were helplessly being done in by the  Imperial Princess and the hero, in a future that had ended up like that,  was the person who had plotted the division of humankind, the culprit  who moved behind-the-scenes, none other than⎯⎯⎯⎯you?\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tI pressed my forehead. My thoughts were instantly organized. The plan  which I had made for conquering the continent from this point on had  changed. The X mark, which I had brandished over Paimon’s name on the  map that was drawn within my head, had promptly disappeared. It would be  too much of a waste if I were to be hostile towards, or tried to purge,  this sort of individual.\n</p><p>\n\tExcept, there was a thirst that had yet to be quenched. If she filled  me in on even this, then be it the Mountain Faction or anywhere else, I  will more than gladly squeeze in. Now, answer me this.\n</p><p>\n\t“Certainly, it is an excellent move. However, it is still lacking.  Even that method ends up failing. Due to the fact that the monarch, who  governs over the Empire of Habsburg, is truly the formidable mastermind,  they are able to destroy both the Empire of Francia and the Kingdom of  Brittany at the same time. In an incredibly short period of time, at  that. Now it would be exceedingly difficult to split apart the human  society.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Dantalian.”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon leered at my direction as if she were admonishing me.\n</p><p>\n\t“How can such a monarch possibly exist? Even the speculation that a  human who is stronger than Sir Baal appearing is already a reckless  suggestion that was difficult to swallow, but for there to also be a  monarch who is powerful enough to nearly unite the entire continent with  one action. This lady is not particularly complaining, but is that not  impossible?”\n</p><p>\n\t“That is correct. Please think about it while taking in that impossibility as a premise.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Umm. Hmm. Mm.”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon chewed on the end of her fan with her teeth. By the looks of  it, that seemed to be an old habit of hers. If you display that sort of  habit, then your inner thoughts can be read by the opposition, making it  an incredibly bad habit. Does she not seem so experienced at times that  it makes it difficult for me to read her intentions, and yet, in times  like this, does she not seem immature like some child? Truly, this woman  was incomprehensible.\n</p><p>\n\tI wonder how much time had passed. Paimon laughed dejectedly.\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“Well, what else can this lady do? If that is the case, then this lady will resort to even <strong>selling her body</strong>.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\t“It does not matter whether that human is a man or a woman. Ehem,  despite how this lady may appear, this lady is the Queen of Mares. If it  is simply a single feeble-minded human, then this lady is confident  that she will be able to capture them with ease. This lady will approach  that human while pretending to be doing them as many favors as  possible. This lady will then utilize all sorts of means and methods in  order to make them fall in love with this lady!”\n</p><p>\n\tLike that.\n</p><p>\n\t“Ah, is that, perhaps, also not allowed? Haa. This lady surrenders.  It is this lady’s defeat. This lady is no longer able to think up of any  more plausible ideas. No, in the first place, Sir Dantalian was the one  who had brought forward too many absurd conditions. It is not this  lady’s fault. Even if you were to ask this question to someone that is  not this lady, they would all raise a white flag.”\n</p><p>\n\tAll of my questions have been answered.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ It is this lady’s first time meeting a man such as yourself.\n</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ This lady shall bestow upon you the right to steal this lady’s lips, Mr. Self-entitled Hero.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tAll of those things were an act.\n</p><p>\n\tIt was a desperate struggle in order to seduce the calamity known as the hero.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ Yes, this lady is a Demon Lord. This lady has deceived you, Hero.  However, is that a problem? This lady loves you. Leaping over all sorts  of favor and spite, be it race or status, enemy or ally, this lady  simply loves you truly. Ever since the moment this lady had first laid  her eyes upon you, and for all eternity.\n</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ Demons and humans living together. This lady had started to  dream of that possibility after meeting you. However, it cannot be  helped, can it? Since dreams are similar to that of the fluttering of  frail flower petals, this lady cannot blame you.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tIt was all a tactical deceit.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ Humans are truly amazing. Did you know that there is a country  referred to as a republic nation somewhere on the continent? This lady  heard that humans, fairies, and dwarves all live equally without  exerting or receiving any discrimination whatsoever. The day where even  humans and demons are able to live together harmoniously like that will  one day arrive. Yes, this lady has no doubts about it.\n</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ This is an already dying body. Could you not bestow upon this lady a final kiss?\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon.\n</p><p>\n\tEven when she was breathing her last breath, she implored love from  her enemy. In the exact moment the shadow of death had enshrouded her  face, the last thing Paimon felt was the hero’s lips. In the end, her  death was the enemy’s breath and kiss. For that to be someone’s last  moment, it was excessively cruel. Exactly what emotions were going  through Paimon’s mind as she requested for that kiss?\n</p><p>\n\tHer love, affection, confession, blushed cheeks that appeared as if  she were shy, the movement of her head as she shook it, the hundreds of  lines she had spoken, and the thousands of body gestures she had made,  what was going through the Queen of Mares’ head while she was doing this  entire performance on her own? Just what sort of venom did she have to  embrace in order to make her performance of affection, that was directed  towards the enemy of her kind who was standing before her,  possible?\n</p><p>\n\tOkay.\n</p><p>\n\tI will admit it.\n</p><p>\n\tFrom this moment on, you are no longer my political rival. A  cooperator. You are a political partner like Barbatos. How could I  possibly leave alone this rare model of an actor?\n</p><p>\n\tYour twisted lamentation. Your resolve that had soaked and tempered  that twistedness and struck it with a hammer until it was stretched out  properly. I had taken a liking to it. Even if I have to grab and drag  both you and Barbatos by the collars, I will lead you two on top of the  stage.\n</p><p>\n\tBe grateful. I am selecting you retired actors, who were once  destined to merely meet your ends while playing supporting characters,  to perform leading roles. The fact that you two treated each other as  enemies was of low importance to me. If you are going to fight, then  fight. Except, exchange blows and slander one another in an area behind  the stage where I cannot see. Since you both are now actors who will be  performing with me, you have the <strong>obligation</strong> to be beautiful while on stage.\n</p><p>\n\tAfter making a decision in my mind, I moved my lips.\n</p><p>\n\t“Your Highness Paimon.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Yes, Dantalian?”\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“Please come visit me at my prison once the morning sun has risen. I shall decide my position at that time.”\n</p><p>\n\tBe relieved, Paimon.\n</p><p>\n\tYou have escaped from my purge list.\n</p><p>\n\tHowever, you will have to be drenched in the blood of others just as much instead.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p><em>(TL note: Please do not read the  English translation of Dungeon Defense on any site that is not my own.

The soil, that had  compacted tightly because of the cold spring rain, was just barely able  to become disgorged after it had received the rays from the spring sun.  It was an unsightly spring since there were no flowers or trees in  sight. It seemed as if spring had yet to arrive because of that. Amidst  this season that felt as if it were still approaching, two people were  approaching from the distance.\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tTwo people were walking this way from the distance. The two noticed  each other and stopped momentarily. They then resumed their way towards  me while furrowing their respective brows.\n</p><p>\n\tThe first side to open their mouth was Barbatos.\n</p><p>\n\t“Fucking Hell. Dantalian, what’s this bitch doing here? Don’t tell me  you called her here. I advise you to tell me that you didn’t. Hurry up  and chase this bitch away. If you don’t, then there’s a good chance that  the answer, which I contemplated throughout the entire night to decide,  will change in less than a minute.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Oh dear, this side is the one who should be making a complaint.”\n</p><p>\n\tLike a piano that had come in competitively during an orchestra performance, Paimon then followed up.\n</p><p>\n\t“This lady had personally received an invitation from Dantalian to  visit around dawn. You coming here at this time is purely a coincidence,  is that not so? If anything, if there is a person who deserves to be  chased out of here the most, then would it not be you?”\n</p><p>\n\t“This bitch said some nonsense a couple of days ago about Dantalian  being hers, but it seems she’s completely nuts now. Seriously, it feels  as if the smell of shit is going to start flowing out of her mouth.”\n</p><p>\n\tBarbatos raised her middle finger on her left hand and made a V shape  with her index and middle fingers on her right hand. One side was a  gesture commonly used in the demon continent, while the other side was a  gesture often used in the human society. Regardless, both sides  contained the same implication of ‘respectfully, go fuck yourself’. By  the looks of it, it seems Barbatos thought that gifting only a single  ‘fuck you’ to Paimon would go against courtesy. That was why, in order  to make sure that anyone would be able to tell that they were being  given the bird, she had presented a ‘fuck you’ on a global perspective.\n</p><p>\n\t“Beasts that shit out of their asses are more aristocrat-like. There  is nothing that can be done for a crazy bitch who shits out of her  mouth. Listen carefully, whore. Dantalian is not your object. Regardless  of whether you invaded Dantalian’s dream and raped him or not.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Haa? What kind of preposterous delusion. Barbatos, although  this lady does not have the duty to go along with your vulgar tone, this  lady will at least clearly tell you a single fact. This lady did not  engage in a physical relationship with Dantalian. Purely in a mental  meaning, that is what this lady meant by having taken Dantalian. In  other words, it contains a psychological context that is so pure that  someone who is of a low birth like you cannot possibly be able to  comprehend it. It is all your foolish misunderstanding and prejudice.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Look at this? A female is clearly emitting an air that she had  bedded a male, so either my eyes are retarded or there’s absolutely  nothing to misunderstand. Aha, or did you two, perhaps, copulate using  the rear hole instead of the front? ‘That was what I had slightly  misunderstood from the air that was floating around you two fuckers  right now’, are you trying to tell me some bullshit that goes along this  line?”\n</p><p>\n\t“It seems you are still unable to comprehend words. Is it your ears  that are weird, or, as this lady had expected, is it your brain that is  rotten? If your hearing is broken, then that is understandable. If your  brain is out of order, then there is room for sympathy. However, if your  personality is the thing that is corroded, then that is beyond  redemption.”\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“This underhanded whore.”\n</p><p>\n\t“What will you do about it, gum-scab chest?”\n</p><p>\n\tHow beautiful.\n</p><p>\n\tThe path that must be crossed in order for life to become a single  melody was distant, but these two were able to extract tunes abundantly  by merely crossing each other with swears. They were gifted singers to  one another. Nevertheless, I had no other choice but to open my mouth  and cease the performance.\n</p><p>\n\t“The two of you, please calm down.”\n</p><p>\n\tIf possible, I wanted to keep watching over your argument, however  right now was the time to cooperate, not fight. The two heard my voice  and turned to look this way.\n</p><p>\n\t“I did, indeed, call the both of you here. It is fine to quarrel, but please do it after listening to what I have to say.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Ah, well, that bitch was the one who started it first since she  screwed me over by refusing the military trial, right? For starters, let  me receive an apology since it’s her fault and not mine.”\n</p><p>\n\t“This lady had advised you to not punish Dantalian in the first  place. But you were most likely unable to hear this lady’s words since  your ears, brain, and personality are corroded three times over.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Does this bitch want to die?”\n</p><p>\n\t“Go ahead and try.”\n</p><p>\n\tThis is troubling. I sincerely want to continue listening to this.\n</p><p>\n\tThus, I let them be for a single moment.\n</p><p>\n\tOnce an hour had passed, the two of them were breathing heavily due  to exhaustion. If I were to give my personal impression, then even if  you combined all of the profanities that I heard throughout my entire  life, that would still be lacking when compared to the profanities which  I had heard during the past hour. Also, consider the fact that I did  not receive only one or two obscenities from people. That was a  remarkable achievement.\n</p><p>\n\t“Is it fine for me to talk now?”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tThere was no objection so it was unanimous.\n</p><p>\n\tI cleared my throat.\n</p><p>\n\t“I, as well, am fully aware of the wrongdoing which I have committed.  A Demon Lord’s authority originates from the fact that they represent  all of demonkind. However, the war speech, which was only bestowed upon  Demon Lords, was stolen from them by a human. The Demon Lord, who should  represent all of demonkind the most, had passed on the right to give  the speech to a being, who cannot and absolutely should not represent  all of demonkind the most; a human. The demons would have no other  choice but to carry suspicions. Why did a human child have to represent  us? Has the Crescent Alliance lost its pride? In truth, was there no  other talented individual out there who could represent us besides that  human?”\n</p><p>\n\tI shrugged my shoulders.\n</p><p>\n\t“Even if the commoners did not harbor any doubts, the problems  continue. There are quite the number of Demon Lords who carry  dissatisfaction towards the current system of the Crescent Alliance  which is led by the Plains Faction-Mountain Faction-Neutral Faction  group. Those people will be the first ones to take action in order to  circulate doubt. They will claim that the current Crescent Alliance does  not have the qualification to act for the demon race. Your authority  itself will tremble.”\n</p><p>\n\tThere were many discontented elements. Rank 1 Baal, Rank 2  Agares. The Demon Lords with the highest amount of prestige did  not take part in the Crescent Alliance. They were most likely making an  implicit complaint.\n</p><p>\n\t“They are merely looking forward to the day we fail. The Demon Lords  who have started this war are us, and the Demon Lords who will have to  take the responsibility for the loss of the war will also be us. The  right to criticize us will be presented to the Demon Lords who,  from beginning to end, did not participate in the expedition.”\n</p><p>\n\tBarbatos and Paimon, they both fell under the category of being  faction leaders. Although their respective political ideologies were  different, because one side was a radical party and the other was a  moderate party, they both had the same single common ground, the fact  that they were both onboard the same boat known as the Crescent  Alliance.\n</p><p>\n\tWe were a group that shared a common destiny.\n</p><p>\n\tIt would be troublesome if I did not make them realize this soon.\n</p><p>\n\t“Your Excellency Barbatos. Your Highness Paimon. We must become one  and form an alliance as soon as possible. If we do not, then the only  thing that will be awaiting us in the future is ruin.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tAfter the two of them had adjusted their breaths, they glared at each other.\n</p><p>\n\t“But I lived until now just so I could torture this bitch.”\n</p><p>\n\t“What a coincidence. It is also this lady’s life goal to trample over you.”\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tIt took 30 minutes this time.\n</p><p>\n\tI beamed while the two panting people were standing before me.\n</p><p>\n\t“I understand that the two of you are alive because you have not  killed each other yet. However, what about this? Does killing each other  still have the priority even when there are backstabbers, who have been  selling the two of you out, brazenly walking around your military  camps?”\n</p><p>\n\t“What? Backstabbers?”\n</p><p>\n\t“For 400 years, the expedition of the Crescent Alliance has failed.  During those 400 years, you all have endeavored in order to obtain  victory, but the other Demon Lords in the back must have devoted  themselves just as much in order to make you all fail. Surely, you do  not believe that there would not be even a single traitor within your  factions?”\n</p><p>\n\tDue to the immensely realistic remark, both Barbatos and Paimon  became silent. There was probably something specific that had come to  their minds. To a certain degree, they were conscious of the fact that  there could be traitors, but they had purposely turned a blind eye to  it. Doing that put them more at ease, after all.\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon slowly opened her mouth.\n</p><p>\n\t“Dantalian, this is an action that can never be stopped once it  has started. The entire demon continent will be split into two sides  and a civil war will begin. It is unadvisable to make enemies in our  rear when we are currently in the situation where the Crusaders are  located right in front of us.”\n</p><p>\n\t“If anything, this moment is the golden opportunity.”\n</p><p>\n\tI declared.\n</p><p>\n\t“Our forces had suffered a defeat just yesterday. It may have not  been a crushing defeat, but a defeat is a defeat. ‘Surely in this  situation where we had lost to the Crusaders, they would not attempt to  purge the ones who, like themselves, are in the rear’, in the position  of those traitors, a purge is something that is incredibly difficult for  them to imagine.”\n</p><p>\n\t“A defeat on the battlefield is, on the contrary, a quick opportunity to clean out.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Yes. That is correct.”\n</p><p>\n\tI nodded my head. While Paimon was calmly dwelling on my words, Barbatos scowled her face at me.\n</p><p>\n\t“Wait. Setting aside the traitors, what are we going to do about  those Crusader bastards? In the end, a purge is just an act that cuts  off your own flesh. We’re already in a state where we’re being pushed  back, so we’ll reach a dead end if we become even weaker now.”\n</p><p>\n\t“It is fine. Currently, the side that is in more of a crisis is the Crusaders.”\n</p><p>\n\tAlthough I normally used informal language when speaking to Barbatos,  no matter how you looked at it, I was an outstanding gentleman since I  was going out of my way to use formal language because of the mere fact  that Paimon was with us. However, similar to how someone would not  notice some dirt stuck underneath their nails, Barbatos seemed to have  not noticed my consideration.\n</p><p>\n\t“Why’s that?”\n</p><p>\n\t“Recall the battle that had unfolded yesterday. Is something not  strange? Regardless of how many disparate groups may be mixed in with  their forces, the overall movement of the Crusaders was excessively  poor. They rushed in the instant Farnese tossed herself out as bait as  if they were all waiting for that exact moment.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tBarbatos’ eyes became narrow. She immediately understood what I was  trying to say. That made the story quick. As expected of Barbatos.\n</p><p>\n\t“Hoh. That means the speech that human child gave is showing  more results than I expected. In order to hold the soldier’s wavering  minds tightly, there was a need for them to kill that child.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Precisely.”\n</p><p>\n\tI raised the corners of my lips.\n</p><p>\n\t“The current situation within the Crusaders is probably severe. Even  if deserters did not particularly appear, the soldiers’ morales have  most likely fallen by themselves. On the other hand, there is a reason  why only the officers and men of Habsburg, who are led by the Imperial  Princess, are still firm.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Because the Imperial Princess’ speech was excellent.”\n</p><p>\n\tThat was so.\n</p><p>\n\tYesterday’s battle ended with the victory of Farnese and Elizabeth.  Farnese’s victory revealed the divided appearance of the Crescent  Alliance while Elizabeth’s victory reflected the dreadful morale within  the Crusaders. There was nothing more miserable than an army where only a  single hero has obtained victory.\n</p><p>\n\t“Moreover, multiple nations were nearly annihilated in yesterday’s  battle. The credit of saving them goes completely to the Imperial  Princess. From the generals to the privates, there is most likely  unrest looming over them within the Crusaders. Excluding Elizabeth von  Habsburg, there is no one else who is dependable. I am certain that this  sort of atmosphere is blowing violently through their forces.  Furthermore, the leading members of the governments of the other nations  would never forgive the spread of this sort of mentality. In the end,  before long, the Crusaders will.”\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tBarbatos and Paimon gazed at me, glared at each other, and then  turned to look at me once more before nodding deeply. The word that came  to mind within the three of our heads was coincidentally the same.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p><strong>Purge.</strong></p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tOur Crescent Alliance was not the only group that was going to arrive  at an internal conflict. Even the Crusaders, while embracing a  different reason, will leap into a state of civil war where the  victorious humans will purge all of the humans who had been defeated. In  other words, from now on.\n</p><p>\n\t“⎯⎯⎯⎯This, is a race against time. According to which army finishes  their purge the fastest, and according to how quickly and efficiently  they are able to carry it out, the outcome of the war will be decided.”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon muttered quietly.\n</p><p>\n\tIt was just as she had said. It was solely a race against time.\n</p><p>\n\tWe had to finish our purge as soon as possible and project a single  condensed military strength. Will the Imperial Princess Elizabeth be  first? Will we be first? The fate of the continent will be determined  according to that. I fumbled with the pocket watch that was in my  pocket. Although a moment of time was a person’s everyday time and the  time of war, from this point forth, time was simply a moment to  slaughter our kind for us. There was no room for hesitation here.\n</p><p>\n\t“Identifying the traitors is simple. The two of you both, return to  your respective encampments and criticize each other. The reason why we  were defeated in yesterday’s battle was because the opposite faction had  responded to the situation foolishly. You two badmouthing each other  whenever you have the time to spare is a daily occurrence anyway so no  one will suspect a thing.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\t“After doing so, ‘Ah, how good would it be if there was a trustworthy  ally?’, slip in this remark. In that moment, there will be a couple of  fellows who will quietly approach you and offer to liaise you with a  ‘Demon Lord who they personally know’. Those people are the traitors.”\n</p><p>\n\tThose who try to seize the opportunity of when the three factions are faltering in order to carry out a military takeover.\n</p><p>\n\tThose who act as the informant of someone specific and try to lure Barbatos and Paimon.\n</p><p>\n\tThey were all parasites that deserved to be exterminated.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tThat night.\n</p><p>\n\tBarbatos and Paimon made their way through the dark curtains and came  to visit me. Their faces, which were half in doubt when they left at  dawn, were now grim. After a long moment of silence, Barbatos began to  speak.\n</p><p>\n\t“There were three people on my side. What about you, whore?”\n</p><p>\n\t“Four people. Although they were mostly youngsters with low ranks.”\n</p><p>\n\tPaimon sighed.\n</p><p>\n\t“Each one of them was an informant for a different Demon Lord. Sir  Baal, Rank 3 Vassago, Rank 4 Gamigin, and Rank 6 Valefor.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Wow. Fuck, that’s nearly the same as me. I got Vassago, Gamigin, and  Valefor on my side. Those fucking bastards. There really is no  easy way to deal with these bat-like bastards.”\n</p><p>\n\tBarbatos gritted her teeth.\n</p><p>\n\tThere are approximately 30 Demon Lords who are participating in this  war. If 7 of them were informants, then that meant that nearly 1/4 of  the entire army were traitors. For leaders, who led a faction, that was a  ratio which they had no other choice but to grind their teeth with  vexation about. Referentially, this was also a number that did not  include the Neutral Faction. Paimon spoke in a worried tone.\n</p><p>\n\t“What will we do about Marbas? Since he has departed in order to  pillage for supplies in the rear, he will be unable to return for a  while.”\n</p><p>\n\t“With that old man’s personality, it’ll be a lot better if he isn’t  present when we carry out a purge. For someone who looks so sinister, he  dislikes shedding unnecessary blood, after all. Once he gets back after  the situation is over, we’ll explain it to him then.”\n</p><p>\n\tBarbatos made an invidious remark.\n</p><p>\n\t“All right. Purge. The Imperial Princess will be after that and then  you’ll be last, whore. Until then, I’ll cooperate with you.”\n</p><p>\n\t“That is something which this lady should be the one to say since we  will be forming an alliance only until everything has been settled. Keep  your neck clean until that moment arrives.”\n</p><p>\n\tBarbatos gave the middle finger and Paimon showed a V with her middle  and index fingers. These two had quite the pretty relationship.\n</p><p>\n\tOn this side of the cage, I watched the appearance of the two Demon  Lords who had snarling faces and appeared as if they were about to tear  each other apart. It seems that the moment to be released from this  prison has almost arrived. It was short, but it was a beautiful life in  prison.\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tI was still in this prison.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><h4>▯King’s Beloved Sword, Human, Laura De Farnese<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 9</p><p> Bruno Plains, Dantalian’s legion</p></h4><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\t“Farnese, you definitely said that you could play music, right?”\n</p><p>\n\t“Mmm? Indeed, that is the case, Lord.”\n</p><p>\n\tToday was the day that hung at the end of the week which His Lordship had forewarned about.\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady adjusted her clothes in front of the prison.  Different to other commanders, this young lady did not appoint an  attendant. This young lady had to manage life on her own, but since this  lady was going to consult with His Lordship about what she should do on  this day, this young lady was receiving an inspection from His Lordship  to see whether she had put on her military uniform properly or not  while she was at it.\n</p><p>\n\t“This is related to music, but. Oi, your mantle is crooked there.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Where?”\n</p><p>\n\t“There. Right there.”\n</p><p>\n\t“If Your Lordship only says ‘there’, then how is this young lady  supposed to know where that is? What method is this young lady supposed  to use in order to figure out where ‘there’ is, when it could be Your  Lordship’s eyes or balls? Instead of only saying ‘there’, give this  young lady some exact directions.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Haa, this troublesome child. I have always laid the right direction out for you. Come here so I can fix it myself.”\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady approached the prison and left the arrangement of her  clothes to His Lordship. His Lordship pulled on the edge of this young  lady’s clothes firmly. Tug, tug through the thick layer of cloth,  this young lady could feel His Lordship’s hands entwining here and  there. It almost felt as if it were this young lady’s first time  experiencing the sensation of having another person help put on her  clothes.\n</p><p>\n\t“So what do you mean by music, Lord?”\n</p><p>\n\t“Is it not your hobby to gather skulls and compose scores while those  skulls are spread out around you? However, you have only written  scores, never have I ever seen you perform them. What sort of conduct is  that?”\n</p><p>\n\t“This young lady did not feel the particular need to play them.”\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady answered honestly.\n</p><p>\n\tMusic was this young lady’s old habit. This young lady was gifted  with an excellent sense of hearing to an accursed degree. As this young  lady was unable to ever forget something which she had heard, it was  indefinitely piled up in a certain corner of this young lady’s skull  like oil. There were many, many days where the oil, that had accumulated  like that, would occasionally become a mirage on its own and play in  this young lady’s head as if it were an auditory hallucination. It was  in those very moments that this young lady would compose scores.\n</p><p>\n\t“Since the sound had already flowed through this young lady’s head,  what reason could there possibly be for this young lady to go out of her  way just to perform and repeat the same tune?”\n</p><p>\n\t“I am saying this because it seems I will soon be able to leave this  prison. I went through this precipitous state in order to protect you,  so would it not be your duty to welcome my release from imprisonment?  Any song would be fine when I come out so pick out the song that you can  play best.”\n</p><p>\n\t“The commemoration of Your Lordship’s release from prison, is it?”\n</p><p>\n\tAfter hearing the reason, it was logical.\n</p><p>\n\tSince this young lady has not even once performed for anyone  throughout her entire life, devoting that first experience to His  Lordship was sufficient enough to be a present. The fact that His  Lordship had to spend a week behind bars because he had covered for this  young lady was, as expected, this young lady’s burden. Referentially,  since His Lordship was a small-minded male by nature, he would never  forget a debt. Rather than living while in debt to His Lordship, being  able to call it even after devoting some good-for-nothing thing like a  first experience was much better.\n</p><p>\n\tRight when this young lady was about to nod her head, a question  abruptly appeared in her mind and made its way through her lips.\n</p><p>\n\t“Lord, this young lady does not mind performing a complimentary concert, but this young lady has a question.”\n</p><p>\n\t“It must be nice to be curious about so many things. What is it this time?”\n</p><p>\n\t“Is this young lady Your Lordship’s doll?”\n</p><p>\n\tSuddenly.\n</p><p>\n\tHis Lordship’s hand stopped.\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady turned her head back dubiously. His Lordship was  silently looking this way. His Lordship’s pupils contained a single  black color so it was relaxing to stare into them. Black was this young  lady’s favorite color.\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“Who said that to you?”\n</p><p>\n\t“The Imperial Princess of the Empire did.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\t“This young lady apologizes for telling Your Lordship this now. This  young lady did not go against your order, Lord. Something like fighting  against the Imperial Princess did not occur. However, after the previous  battle was over, the Imperial Princess had called for this young lady.  The Imperial Princess said this after calmly examining this young lady.  Are you a puppet? Are you a corpse? Or are you both? She claimed that it  was perplexing since all of the people, who Your Lordship tries to  embrace, have only remains left.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\t“The Imperial Princess said to pass on a message to Your  Lordship. That, after meeting your doll, I, Elizabeth von Habsburg,  think she is somewhat pretty.”\n</p><p>\n\tHis Lordship listened up to that point and let out a sigh.\n</p><p>\n\t“Were you shaken by those words?”\n</p><p>\n\t“This young lady did not waver. Since this young lady is neither a  puppet nor a corpse, she is a human who is living properly. Your  Lordship had given life to this young lady. That is something which this  young lady has never had a shadow of a doubt about.”\n</p><p>\n\t“However?”\n</p><p>\n\tHowever.\n</p><p>\n\tHowever.\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady nodded her head.\n</p><p>\n\t“As expected, this young lady wondered if she were a child who was wrongly born into this world.”\n</p><p>\n\tHis Lordship became silent. Even during muteness, emotions did not  emerge in His Lordship’s eyes. His Lordship, for someone who mostly  displayed trivial emotions to his heart’s content, never expressed even a  shred of any serious emotions. Even though people were generally the  complete opposite of that. Since His Lordship was quiet, this young lady  continued speaking comfortably.\n</p><p>\n\t“This young lady can guess why Your Lordship scrapes together only  remains. A ruin will not be lonely when within ruins. If there are only  collapsed remains in one’s surroundings, then the wreckage is not  something that had simply met its end there, but instead, it is  something that feels as if it can continue to stay there and something  that appears sufficient on its own. This young lady is able to consider  herself to be a normal individual when within that place since Miss  Lapis, Captain Humbaba, and the other witches are there. Your Lordship  must also be like that in your own right.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Regardless, we are able to breathe by going into Your Lordship’s  embrace, but what does Your Lordship plan to do? Even if Barbatos can  hug Your Lordship, is she not incapable of shouldering you? Even if  Paimon pulls Your Lordship in, is she not incapable of taking you in  whole? Miss Lapis and, as expected, this young lady as well are worried  that, on the contrary, Your Lordship may be the one to embrace those  two. Lord, is that okay?”\n</p><p>\n\tHis Lordship scratched his forehead. After sighing a couple of times,  His Lordship soon drew his brow together and flicked this young lady’s  forehead.\n</p><p>\n\t“Hoah.”\n</p><p>\n\t“That is why I have been telling you to quickly become independent,  you fool. Look at Lapis. Even if I do not give her any orders, does she  not get everything done on her own? It would be great if you all were  able to hastily follow Lapis’ example.”\n</p><p>\n\t“It feels like the horrors of the world would increase if people followed Miss Lapis’ example.”\n</p><p>\n\t“What nonsense is the person, who should have already easily slaughtered over 10,000 people, saying?”\n</p><p>\n\tThat was true.\n</p><p>\n\tHis Lordship took something out from his coat. It was a masquerade  ball mask. This young lady tilted her head, unsure of what His Lordship  intended to do by handing that mask to this young lady.\n</p><p>\n\t“What sort of mask is that?”\n</p><p>\n\t“Tomorrow, we will purge every last traitor within the Crescent  Alliance. When you perform your concert in celebration of my release,  the majority of the Demon Lords taking part in the Crescent Alliance  will gather momentarily under the pretext of holding a religious service  towards the Gods. Those who are wearing masks will live, and those who  are not will die.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tI see, a tool to identify friend or foe.\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady was curious as to why it was a music performance of  all things. This young lady’s performance was bait to attract attention.  The Demon Lords will take their seats and will all be watching this  young lady. That very moment, when they have lowered their guards, was  the prime opportunity to wipe out the traitors in one fell swoop.\n</p><p>\n\t“It seems it will be quite the special concert, Lord.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Of course, it is the day where I am being released from prison so it  should be special, should it not? The preparation of the stage will be  taken care of by Barbatos and Paimon. Do not be concerned and just  perform. By the time you hit the last key, the bodies of traitors will  be sprawled out there.”\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\tThis young lady nodded in approval.\n</p><p>\n\t“However, you have yet to answer this young lady’s question, Lord.  Trying to go past it evasively will not work on this young lady. Please  answer. Is this young lady Your Lordship’s doll?”\n</p><p>\n\tHis Lordship clicked his tongue.\n</p><p>\n\t“It seems only your pettiness has increased needlessly. If you are  curious about that, then come back after carrying out today’s battle. By  the time you return, you will have figured out the answer on your own.”\n</p><p>\n\tThus, this young lady set forth.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p><img data-attachment-id=\"48713\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2017/01/05/dungeon-defense-volume-4-chapter-1/25x25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png\" data-orig-size=\"25,25\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"25×25\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=25\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=25\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=25\" alt=\"25x25\" width=\"25\" height=\"25\"></p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tToday was a day where the short rainy season of early spring had ended and the sky had cleared.\n</p><p>\n\tAlthough there were pools of mud still  stagnated here and there on the ground, it felt as if they were going to  dry up soon because of the hot spring sun. Once the soil has become  firm, the war will most likely resume in earnest again. Currently, be it  the Crescent Alliance or the Crusaders, they simply sent out detached  units occasionally and had minor battles.\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady led a single squad and  wandered from this side to that side of the great plain. En route, we  encountered enemy scouts and assaulted them, but they were barely a  problem. It was at the moment when this young lady thought that today  was going to simply end like how the past couple of days had. From the  other side of the plain, a single group of enemy soldiers gradually  rushed towards us. This young lady held her breath for an instant after  glancing at the flag the enemy soldiers were carrying.\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tA pattern with a blue hydrangea and a buck.\n</p><p>\n\tThe House of Duke Farnese from the northern region of the Kingdom of Sardinia.\n</p><p>\n\tThe flag of the family that this young lady was born and raised in was there.\n</p><p>\n\t“Araa? For some small unit like that to try  and pick a fight with us, they have a lot of guts. What should we do,  General? If you tell us to wipe them out, then we will immediately.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\t“General? The likes of us can only move if you give us a command.”\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady merely answered the Captain  of the Royal Guard, Humbaba’s words with silence. Even while this young  lady was quiet, time steadily flowed and the enemy soldiers gradually  drew near. Then, the enemies soon stopped.\n</p><p>\n\tShortly after, a single man came out from  the center of the enemy group while riding on a war horse. The man, who  was brilliantly wearing a blue set of armor and helmet, spread his arms  out wide and shouted.\n</p><p>\n\t“Laura! My loveable child! This father of yours is here!”\n</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯⎯⎯By that one line, regardless of whether they were allies or enemies, every single common soldier stared at this young lady.\n</p><p>\n\tThe bewilderment on the soldiers’ faces was  evident. Especially the witches who were a part of the Royal Guard. The  witches were aware of the secret behind this young lady’s birth. The  fact that this young lady was the daughter of a slave and was also a  child who was sold off as a slave.\n</p><p>\n\tIndeed.\n</p><p>\n\tIndeed, it was exactly on the third day, Lord.\n</p><p>\n\tDespite not having seen him, the Imperial  Princess babbled smoothly as if she understood His Lordship, and His  Lordship as well was able to accurately predict what the Imperial  Princess would do because he understood her, despite not being able to  see her.\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady carefully observed the  elderly man. A deeply seamed face, a smile that appeared as if it were  overflowing with goodwill towards people, without a doubt, this man was  the biological father that had given birth to this young lady and had  also violated her.\n</p><p>\n\t“I rushed here urgently after I heard the  news that you were here. Aha, but what is this? This father of yours is a  human and you are the child of a human, and yet, why is the place where  you are standing at not among humans but in the center of demons?  Laura, return to the place where you rightfully must be.”\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady’s father.\n</p><p>\n\tThe place where she rightfully must be.\n</p><p>\n\tWas this young lady’s biological father  referring to that dust-filled library as the place where this young lady  must be? That small room where one had to offer their body once in  order to receive a single meal? The name of the prison where this young  lady had tried to disappear just like that by starving herself to death,  but without fail, her father would break down the door and keep this  young lady alive, and by keeping her alive, he kept her dead.\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady quietly closed her eyes. The  sound of cicadas that could still be vividly heard were there, and  between the bug cries that compactly resonated all around, a groan  crawled through.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ Laura, uh. Laura.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tWhen this young lady’s father violated her, this young lady was silent.\n</p><p>\n\tShe did not resist.\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady did not wish to raise her  nails and leave her mark by ripping into his shoulder blades. People who  do not want to disappear from the world are bound to grab onto  something, but the only place that this young lady could grab was her  father’s exposed back. Whenever this young lady’s father groaned  slightly into this young lady’s thigh, stomach, and face, the thought  that this human still fairly wants to live would cross her mind.\n</p><p>\n\tWell.\n</p><p>\n\tSince this young lady boasted an immense  amount of beauty, it was not like this young lady was unable to  understand her father. If there were a large rod attached to this young  lady’s lower body and, after throwing a slight amount of this young  lady’s ethical conscience away, this young lady had the ability to  freely penetrate the most beautiful woman in the world, then this young  lady would test out the effectiveness of her rod without any hesitation.  If you do not use it in times like those, then for what reason were you  born with one?\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ I love you, Laura. I sincerely love you.\n</p><p>\n\t⎯⎯ I am doing all this because I love you. What is wrong? You are acting strangely. What is it, you keep behaving weirdly.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tAah.\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady could say this confidently  now that she has met His Lordship. That was not love. That behavior,  which had harmed, turned, and twisted this young lady, was not and could  never be love. If there was love in the world, then it must not become  something like that. How could forcing yourself onto another person and  being in a position where you have no other choice but to embrace them,  be called love?\n</p><p>\n\tIf something like that was love, then this young lady will forever live cold.\n</p><p>\n\tThere was no one who could accept this young lady and there was no one this young lady could accept.\n</p><p>\n\tIn truth, there was only a single type of  love that people like His Lordship, this young lady, and Miss Lapis were  capable of. Not a love where we loved each other, but a love where we  all loved a single thing together. That alone was the one and only  livelihood that could avoid ruin. The one and only. In order for people  like us to survive, the one and only. As we would die if we loved  in a different method. As we would kill and would also die, the one and  only.\n</p><p>\n\tSomething quietly brushed against this young lady’s cheek and flowed by.\n</p><p>\n\tBeside this young lady, the captain of the Royal Guard muttered in a tone that felt as if it were crawling on the floor.\n</p><p>\n\t“Your Excellency Acting General?”\n</p><p>\n\t“The world is quite damned, Captain. This  young lady was not born because she wished to be born and she was not  raised like this because she aspired to be raised this way, and yet, why  must this young lady handle her entire life on her own? This young lady  cannot forgive anyone.”\n</p><p>\n\tShe must not even try to forgive.\n</p><p>\n\t“This young lady does not have that kind of strength.”\n</p><p>\n\tShe must not even try to think differently.\n</p><p>\n\t“No ability.”\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady is merely tempted to kill the human before her.\n</p><p>\n\tAah.\n</p><p>\n\t“This young lady is incompetent. This  young lady is, boundlessly incompetent. This young lady has no other  choice but to live the way she was born. Even if this young lady lives  in that regard, that is not living. The Imperial Princess’ words were  correct. This young lady is a corpse, a doll. However, it cannot be  helped. This young lady is incompetent.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tHumbaba, the Captain of the Royal Guard carefully grabbed this young lady’s forearm.\n</p><p>\n\tThe Captain uttered ‘Mm, mm’ for a long time  as if she were trying to audibly select her words inside of her  mouth before eventually, she smiled gaily.\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“Yup! That’s right. Really, the world is  damn jumbled! Moreover, the General is damn incompetent as well. Even if  you kill ten thousand and know how to slaughter a hundred thousand,  what can you do when you can’t even kill something like your own past?  Ah hah ha! But it’s okaaay. General, it’s completely fine.”\n</p><p>\n\tCaptain Humbaba laughed.\n</p><p>\n\t“If need be, then we can kill master and commit suicide all together!”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Ahahah. It’s a relief that there’s still a  lot of people in the world who are trying to kill our master. ‘How dare  someone like you attempt to take our master’s liiife?’, and we have to  be the ones to kill those people first, right? That’s why, General,  endeavor with all your strength and kill a lot! Until the day when there  isn’t even a single person, who wants to kill our master, left in the  entire world!”\n</p><p>\n\tThe witches shrieked with laughter.  Delightfully like devils and innocently like children, the witches  dispersed heated laughter throughout the air. This young lady was  certain that she had seen the spring sun, which thus far was only  stagnated on the pools of mud, had at last begun to flow because of the  sound of the witches’ laughter.\n</p><p>\n\tWas that it? Did this young lady simply need a person who would die together with her?\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady imagined herself being  killed by a person other than His Lordship. That was unforgivable. This  young lady also imagined His Lordship being murdered by someone other  than this young lady. That was unpardonable.\n</p><p>\n\tI see.\n</p><p>\n\tThat was so. That was it. That was the case.\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady nodded her head.\n</p><p>\n\t“That man. This young lady dislikes the sight of him. Sweep them away and bring him here.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Yeess, Your Excellency!”\n</p><p>\n\tThe witches jubilantly flew into the air.  The witches had a monopoly of the sky which had little vapor since the  rainy season was over. Throughout the air, the witches scattered the  gunpowder from their pouches and dropped flames. The enemy formation  instantly collapsed and dispersed.\n</p><p>\n\tDid they perhaps assume that this young lady  would not ruthlessly attack her biological father? The Imperial  Princess most likely sent him as a disposable card anyway. If this young  lady is persuaded, then that would be the best case scenario, if this  young lady’s heart wavers, then that was what the Imperial Princess was  aiming for, and if this young lady kills her own father, then the  Imperial Princess could utilize that politically as it is. This sort of  calculation must have been contained within this action.\n</p><p>\n\tIf this young lady was a single person, then she would have even considered realistic calculations.\n</p><p>\n\t“La-Laura! You, what are you?”\n</p><p>\n\tBut this young lady was not alone.\n</p><p>\n\tA man who was much, much more competent than this young lady was standing behind her.\n</p><p>\n\tEven if this young lady were to go around  stirring battlefields however she pleased, there was an individual who  was supporting her from behind and will always pick up after her.\n</p><p>\n\tTherefore.\n</p><p>\n\tRight now, this young lady will live however she pleases.\n</p><p>\n\t“Father.”\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady looked down at her father  who the witches had dragged before her after having bound his limbs. He  looked this way with a face that appeared as if he could not believe  what was happening. A pitiful man. Does he even know the fact that he  had been used by the Imperial Princess?\n</p><p>\n\tIf he was able to persuade this young lady  and bring her to the side of the Crusaders, then that was like  establishing an exploit that will remain throughout history. The man  standing before this young lady was most likely lured here by those  honeyed words. Blame yourself who was foolish enough to have been  deceived by that.\n</p><p>\n\t“Laura.”\n</p><p>\n\t“That is right, Father. It is your Laura.  The girl who was your Laura is here. For what reason did you  deliberately roll all the way to a perilous place like this? This is a  battlefield where devils salivate. This is not a place where a careless  man, such as you Father, should ever dare set your foot in.”\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady knelt down on one knee and  matched her father’s eye level. He must have felt kindness from this  young lady’s words as his face had brightened up. He seemed to have  sensed a hope that, at the very least, he will not lose his life.\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady lifted her father’s right  arm and pressed it firmly against her cheek. The arm that had violated  and suppressed this young lady. That monster’s strong and rough palm was  now ticklish.\n</p><p>\n\t“Thank you for giving birth to this young lady, Father.”\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“I-I am also happy that you are my daughter.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Mhm. Then you will also be able to depart happily.”\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady smiled brilliantly.\n</p><p><img data-attachment-id=\"57774\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2017/01/29/dungeon-defense-volume-4-chapter-4/_volume_4_-_page_313/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/volume_4_-_page_313.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"820,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"_volume_4_-_page_313\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/volume_4_-_page_313.jpg?w=205\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/volume_4_-_page_313.jpg?w=700\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/volume_4_-_page_313.jpg?w=700\" alt=\"_volume_4_-_page_313\"></p><p>\n\tJust now, this young lady may have made the most beautiful smile she has ever made since she was first born.\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady could feel it herself.\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady’s father blinked.\n</p><p>\n\t“What?”\n</p><p>\n\t“From this point forth, this young lady is  no longer Father’s Laura, but instead, she is simply His Lordship’s  Farnese. Although this young lady is not incredibly happy about being  His Lordship’s Farnese, it seems to be enough for this young lady to  continue living. This young lady was able to bask in this much  satisfaction thanks to you, Father, for having given birth to this young  lady, so how could she not possibly express her final gratitude?”\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady took out a dagger from her  clothes and before the opposition could even utter another word, she  slit the throat of the man before her. A crimson red line spread open  and blood splurted out. Although the man struggled, this young lady did  not let go of his right arm till the bitter end. This young lady kept it  pressed against her cheek firmly until the man went limp.\n</p><p>\n\t“Please die painfully. Duke of Farnese, this young lady is happy that she was able to kill you.”\n</p><p>\n\tAck, ack, the man vomited blood as he  collapsed. This young lady stroked the man’s head for a long time. The  witches were laughing together while taking the lives of the  other captives. ‘Kill and kill again’, the words which His Lordship had  once said to this young lady were occurring here. Since His Lordship’s  words were a verbal promise, there was never a day where his words were  never realized. The flag, which His Lordship had earlier bestowed, was  fluttering above our heads due to the gentle breeze.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tAuthority for blood.\n</p><p>\n\tBlood for authority.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tAh, the spring day amidst the screaming of  the captives was beautiful. This young lady sat down on the mud where  blood was being spilled and shut her eyes. The puddle of blood, which  this young lady’s father had shed, viscously received the weight of this  young lady’s body. For the first time in this young lady’s life, her  heart pounded in anticipation for the approaching seasons.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tThis young lady killed her biological father on this day.\n</p><p>\n\tAnd on this day, this young lady became His Lordship’s child.\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian<p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 10</p><p> Bruno Plains, Army of the Crescent Alliance, Simple Prison</p></h4><p>\n\tΟ\n</p><p>\n\tAn altar was set up at the bottom of the hill that was visible from  the prison. It wasn’t a fancy altar. As it was an altar that was made so  that the army, which had faced a poor defeat, could quell the anger of  the Gods, fanciness was a luxury that was unworthy of them. However,  even if it was not fancy, Barbatos was a woman who knew how to make  things pretty.\n</p><p>\n\t“I heard that the number of skulls your girlie collected in the  meantime easily reaches the thousands. If we erect a tower with those,  then that’d be the perfect decoration for the ancestral rites.”\n</p><p>\n\tIn short, it was a suggestion to make a tower of skulls. Although it  was a design that went so astray from being sane that it would make  someone’s head feel dull, performing an ancestral rite with the skulls  of the enemy was appropriate to use as a justification. Above all,  Farnese was very pleased by it.\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“Mhm. Your Lordship’s lover has good taste. The skull has the most  beautiful physical form in the human body. When holding a religious  service, is it not obvious that displaying only the most beautiful  region of the human body is appropriate? This young lady supports the  tower of skulls.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Don’t try to buddy up with me, you human girlie. What do you, who  was born with muddy blood, think you’re doing by thoughtlessly speaking  informally with a monarch? If you weren’t Dantalian’s acting general,  then you would have died by my hands a hundred times over.”\n</p><p>\n\tAlthough Barbatos complained, she prepared the stage anyway. She  utilized her troops and stacked the skulls in a neat pile. Farnese  possessed the skulls of privates, the skulls of noncommissioned  officers, the skulls of captains, and the skulls of commanders, all  separated by category, so the tower was piled up according to ranks. The  privates were at the very bottom and the commanders were at the very  top. Alas, that was the chain of command, it was the chagrin of military  personnel who were treated according to their ranks even after death.\n</p><p>\n\tHumans held their ancestral rites at dawn and demons held theirs at  dusk. The rain had ceased and the evening sun was seeping into the  transparent sky. Each skull that was smoothly cleaned, received the  setting sun and glowed a bright red, and occasionally, amber.\n</p><p>\n\t“Hmmm.”\n</p><p>\n\tBarbatos stretched.\n</p><p>\n\t“Now the preparations are over. Let’s quickly spray some blood over  the ancestral rites table and get this over with. We have to kill the  Imperial Princess as well, and also torture those snakes lurking in the  rear. Iyaaah, since there are so many bastards we have to kill, this  year is going to be an abundant year.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Barbatos, if you do not attach an obscene word at the end of every  one of your sentences, then do you perhaps contract malaria? Regardless  of whether they are traitors now, they were once one of our followers.  Please be a bit more solemn.”\n</p><p>\n\t“Whether they die by a solemn bastard or a frivolous bastard, in the  position of the guys who are going to die, they’re sons of bitches and  those sons of bitches are them, so what’s the point?”\n</p><p>\n\t“Haa. At any rate, people like you. Oh well. This lady will go down first, Dantalian. This lady will see you later.”\n</p><p>\n\tThe two Demon Lords went down the hill side by side. Their shadows stretched out all the way to the prison where I was seated.\n</p><p>\n\tTime passed and the Demon Lords from the Mountain Faction and the  Plains Faction slowly started to gather down below and took their seats.  Eventually, all of the Demon Lords were finally present at the time  when the sunset was at its zenith. Although the Demon Lords were talking  in whispers and chatting away, they all closed their mouths once the  ancestral rite had begun. The bottom of the hill became still.\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tSeveral priests came forward and started to recite sutras. The  memorial service progressed calmly. Each time the priests kowtowed, the  Demon Lords would stand up and do a deep bow as well. After several bows  in worship, which meaning could not be understood.\n</p><p>\n\tStep.\n</p><p>\n\tFarnese walked out into the center of the ceremony. Farnese was  barefooted. Farnese stepped on the soil, that was still wet, with her  white feet. Even though I was far away in this prison and could not see  Farnese’s face, it felt as if the sound of pitter-patter resonated each  time she took a step.\n</p><p>\n\tFarnese sat down in front of the piano without even greeting the  Demon Lords. I felt as if I could hear the sound of a portion of the  Demon Lords voicing their complaints. According to Barbatos, it seems  there were quite the number of people who considered the very act of  letting, not a demon, but a human participate in our memorial service as  blasphemous. Barbatos declared that, since those soldiers were killed  by that little one, it would only be correct if she were the one to play  the melody and soothe the Gods. Since those were not incredibly wrong  words, the other Demon Lords said that they understood and looked over  it.\n</p><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tFarnese slowly placed the end of her fingers on the keys.\n</p><p>\n\tI did not offer any particular words to Farnese who must have  probably returned after having killed her own father yesterday. I  believed that she was able to think on her own now, and I also believed  that she will be able to overcome it on her own.\n</p><p>\n\tTherefore, as this was a recital to purge the long-standing traitors.\n</p><p>\n\tAt the same time, this was also a concert that announced Farnese’s farewell to her past.\n</p><p>\n\tI rested my chin on my hand while sitting in my chair and gazed at  Farnese. Today was the day that officially marked the fact that I have  been in this prison for over a week. Although I was still in this  prison, I was watching over Farnese closer than I have ever done so  before.\n</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>\n\t“.”\n</p><p>\n\tAnd.\n</p><p>\n\tThe performance of blood began.\n</p>"

She then dragged me outside and got upset at me. Are you nuts? You’re doin’ things just because they tell you to? Do you have no shame? Will you be able to become&nbsp;a man at this rate? That’s what she said to me. When I, who was standing there vacantly and felt like his head was going to explode, heard those words.</p><p>I, I, I hit Minhee’s hand away.</p><p>I cried.</p><p>I got on my knees. I cried.

For what, what reason? A lot of time was required before words that barely sounded like a language, that had a hint of logic in them could be spoken.</p><p>During that long period of time, Minhee didn’t utter a single thing.

Vomit and internal organs that couldn’t be wiped clean, flesh and blood hidden in places where rags couldn’t reach, these terrible smells emanated from these things as they dried and dug their way into my nose. However, there was a different fragrance mixed in this time. It was the smell of leaves and stamens, the smell of trees and the sap on the trees.</p><p>I heard the sound of a door closing behind me.</p><p>I raised my head. At the same exact time, Sophna, who was confined within a steel cage, lifted her head as well.</p><p>“What are you here for?”</p><p>Sii hesitantly took a step back. That was how penetrating Sophna’s eyes were. It felt as if her falling apart earlier was a lie. It felt like I could hear her denying it herself as well. That it never happened. That that was nothing more than a momentary illusion, Sophna Radgrinkle was soundlessly making that declaration.</p><p>That was something that had definitely happened. That memory remained in my mind as well. That was most likely engraved in your eyes as clear as the crack in your pupils.</p><p>I knew this, so I talked with an attitude that clearly displayed that I was aware.</p><p>“I’m here to interrogate you.”</p><p>Sophna made a face that appeared as if she had heard a joke.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>I dragged a chair forward and sat down on it. I hung my beads around my wrist and took out a pen and notebook.</p><p>“I received an order to cooperate with the guard in order to figure out who had carried out the assault within the castle while either acting as a part of the Gongshik or pretending to be one of them. The Earl didn’t retract this order either. Roroa, the Vice-captain of the guard, transferred the task of interrogating the suspect over to me. Therefore, interrogating you, the prime suspect, would simply be following procedures and lawful as well.”</p><p>Sophna let out a ‘hah!’ sound and laughed.</p><p>“Do you think this nonsense will work? Do you truly believe so? Are you that dim-witted? Mii is a bright child. Although there is a problem with her learning capabilities, how much do you think I have taught her? Do you believe that we are incapable of resolving a misunderstanding between us?”</p><p>“It will be difficult. The mask and dagger are quite the indisputable pieces of evidence. They’re completely identical to what was discovered next to Alshi.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“A trivial ploy like that! Were you not the one who had planted those!?”</p><p>“Did your magic not prove otherwise?”</p><p>“You most likely didn’t plant them yourself! That sort of childish trickery!”</p><p>“Then who could have planted them?”</p><p>“It was probably Ariya! Or that Roroa girl could have done it! Or······.”</p><p>Sophna paused in the middle of her sentence. She stared at Sii, who was standing beside me, for a moment before speaking in a weak voice.</p><p>“So it was you.”</p><p>Sii didn’t back off this time. She took in a deep breath.</p><p>Sophna glared at me as her body trembled.</p><p>“There is truly no other ponce like you. How could you do such a cruel thing!? Do you know what sort of severe reprimanding Sii will receive once Mii learns of this!?”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>I spoke&nbsp;and wrapped my arm around Sii’s shoulder.</p><p>“You obviously know as well. That’s why you won’t be able to accuse anyone of having planted these pieces of evidence.”</p><p>A smile which resembled a poisonous mushroom spread across Sophna’s face.</p><p>“Do you truly think that? How laughable. Do you think I’ll keep my mouth shut for the sake of an illegitimate child······?”</p><p>“Yup. That’s right.”</p><p>Sii uttered.</p><p>Sophna paused. Sii continued to speak and didn’t back down.</p><p>“Miss Sophna, is a good person.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>“Yup~~ w-when I learned Korean, when I adjusted my way of speaking in Korean to make a character, Miss Sophna helped me······ many times, she······ she’d show me kindness. That’s why, that’s why I, this narrow-minded and timid girl, kept judging Miss Sophna to be a ‘good person’. Because she cherished me.”</p><p>Sii dropped her head and ended her words with a trembling voice.</p><p>“Because I-I inherited my father’s blood.”</p><p>The Head Vassal who had protected the Earl’s bloodline for over a century bared her teeth.</p><p>“That’s a very generous interpretation. If that were the case, then,”</p><p>“I-I know.”</p><p>“What exactly do you know?”</p><p>“That Miss Sophna isn’t a ‘good person’······ rather than that, you’re ‘a person whose priorities are clear’. In other words, if you put me and Her Excellency the Earl on a scale, then Her Excellency would be first.”</p><p>Sii and the Earl were similar in this regard. They were sensitive to the direction of the affection that was directed towards them.</p><p>“I-In other words, even while knowing that I was being harassed, even though you could have easily done something about it, unlike Zia, yup, instead of doing that······ Be it the pre-established faction maids who follow Miss Sophna or anyone else, no one took my side. If anything, when my arm was going to be severed after being framed, they stood as witnesses.”</p><p>Furthermore, Sii and the Earl were different in this regard. Whenever their emotions went rampant, the Earl’s eye rims would dry up, but the edges of Sii’s eyelids would become red. Along with her red pupils, it felt like I was looking at a desert sunset.</p><p>“There’s⎯⎯⎯There’s no way that something like that would have happened without Miss Sophna’s approval. Since for Miss Sophna······ for Miss Sophna, rather than my arm, rather than something like my arm, Her Excellency’s will had precedence.”</p><p>Sophna averted her gaze as if she had been dyed in flames.</p><p>“That time······ that is not the only reason why that had happened.”</p><p>I could feel Sii tremble. I pulled her into a hug.</p><p>I stuck out a single finger while comforting her.</p><p>“What goes around comes around. I believe that you won’t cause a commotion for having been betrayed by a girl who had taken part in pressing false charges against you when you yourself had played a part in pressing false charges as well. An inflexible person who had lived for 187 years probably wouldn’t display such shameful behavior. Thus, you can say that Sii was the only one who had the qualification to hide those pieces of evidence. This is one reason.”</p><p>I extended another finger.</p><p>“Just as Sii had said, there’s a difference. If you compare Sii and the Earl, then the Earl would come first. As expected, you’ve probably given a higher priority to the Earl, the direct descendant, rather than an illegitimate child like Sii, right?”</p><p>Sophna didn’t answer.</p><p>Although I had a theory about this, I didn’t bring it up. It wasn’t the right time.</p><p>“However, if you’re more inclined towards the Earl and not Sii, then what would happen if you compared Sii’s safety with your own self-preservation? I don’t believe that you, who had protected the Earl’s bloodline for the past 187 years, could possibly place Sii in a deadly situation just for the sake of your own self-protection. Thus, you can say that Sii was the only one who had the qualification to hide those pieces of evidence.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Believe what you want to believe. Let us see what happens when you try to confirm it.”</p><p>Even though she had said those words provokingly, there was no strength in her voice. She must have realized this as well as she quickly supplemented her words.</p><p>“Even if that were the case······ even if you were right, do you think that something as simple as that dagger and mask would be enough to be such decisive pieces of evidence? There is no reason for me to go out of my way in order to point at Sii. Anyone could have hidden those items in my office. All I have to do is say this. If I had done it, then why would I do something as foolish as placing such obvious pieces of evidence under my desk? I’m saying this once more, but Mii is a bright child.”</p><p>“I also think that. The two of you will probably arrive at the truth. The two of you will most likely manage to work out this misunderstanding. All of this is similar to incidents that would normally happen in episodic drama series, so it will probably be resolved faster than what one might normally expect.”</p><p>I adjusted my glasses and spoke sternly.</p><p>“That is to say, if I’m not at the Earl’s side.”</p><p>Sophna froze.</p><p>I sat down comfortably with my legs crossed.</p><p>“I’ll tell you what’s going to happen after this point, Miss Head Vassal.”</p><p>I tilted my head and lowered my voice.</p><p>“The Earl isn’t going to come here.”</p><p>As if I were whispering.</p><p>“After tonight, even after she’s become sober in the morning, she will not be coming here. Be it the next day, the day after, or even a week after, she won’t come here to meet you. She won’t summon you either.”</p><p>Sophna’s body shook.</p><p>“Do you······ do you think that you can make that happen? Do you think that you can control Mii? Do you think that you have such an ability?”</p><p>“Those are quite the strange questions. If you consider the fact that you were thrown into this prison because I was able to do so.”</p><p>“You will not be able to do so!”</p><p>Sophna shouted. I didn’t mistake this as a refutation that came from anger.</p><p>“I shouldn’t be able to. Because you have to look after the central water source. Because there are maids who are loyal to you. Because the end of the month is approaching.”</p><p>Since the city will be sent flying if she doesn’t look after the central water source, she has to relieve it beforehand, since the pre-established faction maids loyal to Sophna will do anything in order to rescue her, and more than anything else, since the Earl was going to send me back to Korea for a day because her summoning limit was going to reset. Because of these reasons, no matter how much I attempted to act behind the scenes, there was a limit to keeping Sophna confined.</p><p>Normally this would be the case.</p><p>“But you said it yourself, didn’t you? That you had come up here after having taken measures so that you don’t have to go down to the central water source for quite the long time. I can just obstruct the pre-established faction maids by utilizing the other maids and the guard. The other issue is the fact that I will be gone for a day to go on vacation, but that won’t be an issue if I just don’t go on my trip.”</p><p>“Are you saying that you won’t go back to your original world!? If the proofs of summonings are renewed, then you will no longer be able to······.”</p><p>“When I went back to Korea for the first time, I brought back a catalyst that belongs to a person I know. I just have to make the Earl summon him next month, grab onto something that can be summon canceled with him, and go back like that. Why are you saying that when you already know all of this?”</p><p>Sophna’s expression changed like dried firewood. I shifted my words into embers and continued.</p><p>“I could do this. I could stand by the Earl’s side while kneeling, servicing,&nbsp;massaging her shoulders, and while being kicked and hit by her. By pushing her very slightly, by pulling her very slightly, I’ll prevent you from reaching her by continuously altering her direction by incremental amounts. Until the day you have to go down to the central water source, I’ll utilize all of that time. Then you’ll be lonely for quite a long period of time. Here. By yourself. Albeit, you supposedly enjoy shutting yourself in, so solitary itself should be enjoyable for you.”</p><p>I spoke.</p><p>“You’ll probably feel uneasy.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>“I was able to move Borg, a branch manager of the Black Dragon Street, within a short period of time. The guard are in my grasp. I wonder how far I could spread my roots while you’re being held captive here. I wonder how much that uneasiness will eat away at you. Do you think that you’ll be able to endure it?”</p><p>“······ I will endure it.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Are you sure? If you were capable of that, then you wouldn’t have tried to kill me so hastily. You would have been patient and waited longer. You overdid yourself in order to take care of the water source and come up for a long period of time just because you lacked that in the first place.”</p><p>Firewood always made a sound whenever they burned. I continued to toss the embers known as words on top of Sophna’s heavy breathing.</p><p>“You should know. It’s because you wanted to kill me, and because you did try to kill me that all of this was possible. In the end, it’s because your murderous intent was real, because that was an undeniable fact that all of these false charges were possible.”</p><p>If she didn’t, then it wouldn’t have been possible to reach this far.</p><p>I wouldn’t have tried to come this far either.</p><p>“It’s really late for self-introductions, but I actually don’t like stimulating things. I wouldn’t have gone this far if you didn’t set a time&nbsp;limit.”</p><p>“I······.”</p><p>“I know. You were probably nervous. Roroa was like that as well, but the fact that the fear of otherworlders had spread this much, although no matter how much I think about it, it’s probably because of that Ahyeon fellow······ since making sly remarks about someone I don’t really know well about would be rude, I won’t do that for the time being. So let’s skip that part for now. No matter what your reasons were, that was something which you shouldn’t have done. You’re your own biggest enemy since you were the one who had cornered yourself into this state.”</p><p>“······Are you saying that I was narrow-minded?”</p><p>“Yup. There is a total of 4 different ways for people to deal with other people. Make an exchange with them, follow them, win them over, or get rid of them. You had no intention to make a deal with me. You obviously didn’t plan to follow me. You didn’t even intend to win me over. You simply tried to get rid of me. The issue is the fact that you weren’t able to do so.”</p><p>I spoke.</p><p>“Now it’s your time to pay the price.”</p><p>A silence fell over us.</p><p>Sophna looked back and forth between me and Sii before closing her eyes. The Earl’s Head Vassal spoke with a voice that sounded like a dried leaf crumbling under a foot.</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>“I’m going to rehabilitate the Earl.”</p><p>I rolled a bead.</p><p>“That I have potential, that there is a possibility for me to achieve this, I believe that you already know all of this. You felt anxiety because you knew this, didn’t you?”</p><p>I rolled another bead.</p><p>“Help me and I’ll let you out of here immediately.”</p><p>Sophna didn’t show any response. Sii pleaded.</p><p>“Miss Sophna, please believe in Yujin.”</p><p>With a sincere voice, the Silver Lion Earl’s half-sister confessed.</p><p>“I, I have a grudge towards Her Excellency the Earl. I still do. S-So······. But I won’t take her life. Although I’ll probably do severe things to her, it won’t be too severe. Yujin will stop me from doing so. Yujin is kind. Yujin, in the end, everything that Yujin does will all be beneficial for Her Excellency the Earl.”</p><p>Sophna opened her mouth slowly.</p><p>“Is that what you believe?”</p><p>“Yup, that’s what I believe. That’s what I think. That Yujin will achieve it. I believe that Yujin will change Her Excellency the Earl completely. Miss Sophna thinks so as well, right?”</p><p>“I know······ Naturally, I am aware.”</p><p>Sophna Radgrinkle spoke as if she were whispering.</p><p>“However, I am also aware that it is dangerous.”</p><p>There was a loud sound.</p><p>The noise had come from behind us.</p><p>Sii flinched and turned around. Her eyes opened widely. I stood up, pulled Sii into my arms, and followed her line of sight.</p><p>The sound was that of the iron door of the torture chamber breaking.</p><p>To be exact, it was the sound of the door being crushed completely.</p><p>“Good day.”</p><p>While stepping on the remains of the iron door which had changed into iron fragments, Yudia Batsand gave that greeting while wielding his spear which was wrapped in a purple glow.</p><p class=\"fix-link-focus\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-38827 aligncenter\" src=\"https://images2-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&amp;gadget=a&amp;no_expand=1&amp;resize_h=0&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fshalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com%2f2016%2f11%2f1gap.png%3fw%3d700\" alt=\"1gap\" data-attachment-id=\"38827\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2016/11/26/your-and-my-asylum-volume-1-chapter-1/1gap/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/1gap.png\" data-orig-size=\"55,55\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"1gap\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/1gap.png?w=55\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/1gap.png?w=55\"></p><div></div><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“You don’t seem very surprised.”</p><p>Yudia let out his signature ‘guhuhu’ laugh and twirled his spear with his hand. Sii let out a shriek and shrunk back.</p><p>And I,</p><p>“I knew it would be you.”</p><p>And I put more strength in my arm that was wrapped around Sii.</p><p>“Borg knew that Sophna intended to kill me before the end of this month.”</p><p>The information must have flowed to him through Ashya. That’s why I was able to comprehend this flow of information.</p><p>“The problem was that you knew as well. You, who didn’t care about anyone and didn’t come to the castle unless you wanted to charge the smartphone. There is no such thing as a causeless outcome. I thought about how, and through what route, you had found out about it.”</p><p>“How detestable. In other words, you had predicted my arrival.”</p><p>“Although I considered you coming here at this moment the worst-case scenario.”</p><p>“Guhuhu, as expected. Regardless, worst-case scenarios are destined to happen. I am here to kill you.”</p><p>“D-Do you think you’ll be able to get out unharmed!?”</p><p>Sii, who had been trembling up to this point, exclaimed. He must have not been expecting that as Yudia raised a single brow.</p><p>“Hmm? Well, would that not be the case? Yujin is not a citizen of this world. He has no civil rights and cannot receive any legal protection. Above all, this isn’t me acting arbitrarily, but a request from Sophna.”</p><p>“Her Excellency the Earl would······!”</p><p>“Additionally, even the Silver Lion Earl’s hatred would follow after. Yujin’s iPad and generator included. How could I refuse such a detestable proposition?”</p><p>Sii froze up with a stifled look on her face. I slowly closed and opened my eyes after comforting her.</p><p>“You most likely couldn’t refuse.”</p><p>I also don’t believe that you had the ability to refuse.</p><p>“You know me.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“I see⎯⎯⎯then you will not get upset for some unknown reason if the arm of that maid over there were to fall off again. Since you know me, Mr. Yujin.”</p><p>Yudia.</p><p>“Guhuhu, that is quite the impressive gaze. This is why I say that one’s true blaze is hiding within oneself.”</p><p>Yudia Batsand.</p><p>“Aah, truly amazing⎯⎯⎯Yujin. In truth, I am detestably sad. How amazing would you have become if I were to let another year pass!? How thrilling would the hate from you at that time be!? Aah, Yujin! I am sincerely excited! Is there,”</p><p>After laughing as if he were intoxicated, he pointed his spear at me.</p><p>“Is there nothing more!?”</p><p>From his purple eyes, a sensuous glint emitted through his monocle.</p><p>“As the Royal Courier of the Martial Origin, there are only 10 people in the world who are capable of beating me in a test of strength. As an ascended-being, I can change the composition of my body and nullify all physical attacks. As a creator of transcendent skills, from slashes to self-protection, I can use all sorts of transcendent skills. A person of this caliber is going to kill you right now. Utilizing every violent ability which I am capable of. Now then, how,”</p><p>With a face dyed with anticipation, Yudia Batsand shouted.</p><p>“How do you intend to stop me!?”</p><p>······.</p><p>“You were making plans for after this month, were you not!? That means you are confident with your chances of survival! Do not tell me that you intended to browbeat Sophna and persuade her, win her over before I got here, and make her cancel the contract after having done so. Is this everything!? Oh, please. Do not say such detestable words! At this moment, I am truly expecting······.”</p><p>Yudia, who was being driven by his enthusiasm, closed his mouth.</p><p>Sii had stepped in front of me.</p><p>“Is there a problem?”</p><p>As if his enthusiasm had been dowsed, Yudia spoke in a low tone. Sii spread her arms out and clenched her teeth.</p><p>Haa, haa. Sii didn’t stand down even though her shoulders were trembling while she was trying to steady her breath.</p><p>Sii.</p><p>“You have been a hindrance since earlier. Get out of the way. I do not want to end up feeling bored as a result of killing you.”</p><p>“Miss Sophna······!”</p><p>Sii exclaimed.</p><p>“I-If Yujin dies, then the false accusation on Miss Sophna would become true! Since Yujin would be dying because of your instigation! Even now, while you’re being imprisoned, if that were to happen, then Her Excellency the Earl seriously won’t······!”</p><p>No.</p><p>That’s not it, Sii. That logic won’t work on them.</p><p>It would be great if it did, but it won’t. Sophna is,</p><p>“······It does not matter.”</p><p>Sophna Radgrinkle spoke.</p><p>“It is just as this Yujin fellow had said earlier.&nbsp;······In order to protect you, Sii, this lady will not say anything in regard to the pieces of evidence. As this is the case, even if Her Excellency the Earl comes to dislike this lady, despise this lady, I will be able to endure it. Any sort of harm that this lady receives is trivial.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Sii let out a sound.</p><p>“But you were in pain!”</p><p>“Although I was in pain.”</p><p>“But you cried······!!”</p><p>“Although I cried.”</p><p>Sophna bit her lips.</p><p>“I can endure it.&nbsp;······This lady is really good at these sorts of things.”</p><p>The Head Vassal of the earl’s household dropped her head. However, her voice was still as clear as day.</p><p>“That’s right, Yujin······ I had abandoned Sii. Even though I knew that Sii was being harassed, I did not stop it. Not only did I remain as a spectator when Sii’s arm was severed, but I gave my approval as well. Sii resented me and I was able to endure it now. Mii will most likely resent and despise me, due to your death. I will also endure that. Mii will one day come to terms with the fact that I had done this for her sake.”</p><p>Sii cried out.</p><p>“Why!? Why do you hate Yujin that much······!!”</p><p>There was a smack.</p><p>“Kahak······!”</p><p>Sii, after being hit, fell to the ground. Yudia brushed the handle of his spear with an irked look on his face.</p><p>“I did not cut you. It would become troublesome, then. Just stay shriveled up over there.”</p><p>“No······!”</p><p>Sii pushed herself back up and clung to Yudia. Yudia let out a sigh, adjusted his monocle, and towards Sii, he,</p><p>“Yudia Batsand.”</p><p>I,</p><p>I spoke.</p><p>“If you lay your hand on Sii one more time, then.”</p><p>If he did,</p><p>If he did, then,</p><p>“What will you do?”</p><p>Tens of thousands of ideas brushed through my head. There was only&nbsp;one effective measure which I could carry out.</p><p>“I won’t do anything for you.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>“I won’t move anymore. I won’t say another word. Of course, I won’t hate you either. I will spend whatever time I have left saying farewell to Sii. You probably don’t want that, Yudia Batsand. You were hoping for something, were you not?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>“If you want to see me struggle for my life, then just stay there.”</p><p>Yudia lowered his leg which he had pulled back in order to kick Sii.</p><p>“How detestable. That is certainly a threat which you can carry out unquestionably while also being effective. You truly do know me now. However, Yujin, how do you intend to struggle?”</p><p>I closed my eyes and opened them.</p><p>“I came to a realization after watching you fight at the arena. In my current state, I cannot win against you no matter what personal connections I use and methods I utilize. Although I could avoid the problem for a moment if I were to hide behind the Earl, that wouldn’t be a fundamental solution. Therefore, I only have one option left to choose.”</p><p>“Are you referring to what I said?”</p><p>“Yup. Nullifying the cause. What you said. Winning Sophna over whether it be by force or persuasion. After doing so, I’ll make her cancel the contract.”</p><p>A look of disappointment appeared on Yudia’s face.</p><p>“As I expected. Then that means there is nothing more to,”</p><p>“Was the area not empty while you were on your way here?”</p><p>Yudia tilted his head slightly.</p><p>“Did you remove them yourself?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Why? Did you think that I would violently kill everyone who was standing guard?”</p><p>“No way. I told you that I saw you fight in the arena. You don’t kill people thoughtlessly. Only when there is enough pretext would you kill them.”</p><p>“Indeed, it would be detestable if something bothersome were to occur. If that is the case, then why did you get rid of them if you already knew that? If you blocked the entrance with a bunch of guards, then there is a chance that I could have delayed this by a day due to it being a hindrance.”</p><p>“Why do you think I did?”</p><p>“You didn’t want to put forward fruitless strength? It could also be dealt with if I don’t kill them but paralyze them all instead. In any case, did you think that it would be over if I appeared?”</p><p>“To be precise, it’s the exact opposite reason.”</p><p>I rolled a bead.</p><p>“I, don’t trust Roroa completely yet.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“This is the most important part. I can’t leave&nbsp;a part like this to a person who I can’t trust. If I order her to place some guards, then Roroa might comply with that order. However, there is a chance that she could get rid of the guards in order to betray me in this crucial moment. If this were to happen, then even I would be affected by it. I would end up using my head in order to deal with this as well. I wanted to prevent this. That’s why I told her to get rid of the guards. Regardless of whether the worst possible situation was to occur.”</p><p>Yudia, even if you were to appear.</p><p>“In order to soundly exhibit myself.”</p><p>I,</p><p>“I came here with the one and only person I trust.”</p><p>“Yujin······.”</p><p>Sii became teary. I pushed up my glasses and turned to face Sophna.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I won’t give up.</p><p>“I’ll persuade you until the very end.”</p><p>Yudia was looking at me while puckering his lips······ He spoke.</p><p>“Do you believe that is going to be possible?”</p><p>“I only do the things which I am capable of.”</p><p>“Do you think that doing that would have any significance? Do you think I will stop if you manage to persuade her?”</p><p>“People like you,”&nbsp;I spoke.&nbsp;“Have a peculiar sense of aesthetics when it comes to things like this.”</p><p>Yudia chuckled.</p><p>“Aha, that’s right. How impressive. Truly magnificent. However, since giving you an infinite amount of time would also be a detestable thing to do.”</p><p>Yudia lifted Sii up. He was holding her in a bridal carry pose. Although the panicking Sii struggled, Yudia calmly received her flailing and tilted his head.</p><p>“Let us say that this will be until I am standing before you.”</p><p>Bead.</p><p>Processing start.</p><p>Processing end.</p><p>“Sophna Radgrinkle.”</p><p>Sophna was closing her mouth shut.</p><p>Step, the sound of a single footstep approached us.</p><p>“If you want to kill me that much, then okay. However, I realized something after hearing what Sii said just now.”</p><p>Sophna didn’t respond.</p><p>Clang. I heard the sound of the end of a spear hitting the ground.</p><p>“Your hatred is unnatural.”</p><p>Sophna paused.</p><p>Grrrrk. The end of the spear drew closer as it scraped the floor.</p><p>“You aren’t biased? You aren’t stereotyping? You looked at me in my entirety? You made your judgment after seeing me? Are you sure that was the conclusion that came up after a realistic assessment?”</p><p>Sophna raised her head.</p><p>Another footstep.</p><p>“If you saw me, then how did you end up seeing me? What was the reason behind why you paid attention to me in the first place?”</p><p>Sophna furrowed her brow.</p><p>The sound of a spear hitting the floor resonated once more.</p><p>“At first, I thought it was because you had a bad experience with Ahyeon. That you were overreacting because of that trauma. But there was something more than that. It’s here right now. Think about it.”</p><p>Sophna was looking at me.</p><p>Once more, the sound of the spear drawing closer as it scraped the floor.</p><p>“Think.”</p><p>Sophna was thinking.</p><p>Another footstep.</p><p>“Around the end of last month, Abriya Mikatni had come to the castle. On that day, that fellow, Yudia said that he was going to go down to your research lab. Did you not hear something about me from him on that day?”</p><p>Sophna jerked.</p><p>And then, silence.</p><p>“Was it not since that moment on that you started to feel an unusual amount of threat from me? Similar to what I had done to the Earl, can you say that someone didn’t lead your train of thought towards a specific direction? Through a couple of passing comments that felt unimportant but had their first impression and firm beliefs towards me⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>“Guhuhuhu.”</p><p>I could hear the sound of laughing.</p><p>I raised my head. Yudia Batsand was laughing.</p><p>“Aah, truly amazing!”</p><p>I don’t want to be praised by you.</p><p>If you consider the fact that I treated you like a good person&nbsp;around that time, I don’t want to be praised by you even more.</p><p>“You are truly amazing. Nevertheless, you are about to be out of time. Is there nothing more?”</p><p>I held my beads tightly.</p><p>“Sophna.”</p><p>“Even so······!!”</p><p>In the end, Sophna Radgrinkle exclaimed spasmodically.</p><p>“Even if I was lead······! Even if it’s prejudice······! Still······! You, you are dangerous······!!”</p><p>Sophna started to catch her breath while lowering her head.</p><p>“This, this is for the best. This is the best way······ For Sii, Her Excellency the Earl, I······ One day, one day you two will also understand.”</p><p>“What are you saying is the best way!?”</p><p>It was Sii.</p><p>Sophna gritted her teeth before grabbing the steel bars of the cage which was confining her.</p><p>“Have you not seen it already!? Do you not know already!? Have you not witnessed that boy deceive people!? Have you not seen him plot things!? How could you trust that sort of fellow!? How could you believe in him!?”</p><p>“Miss Sophna, Miss Sophna did it first! It’s because you were the one who tried to kill Yujin first!”</p><p>“That is not the case! In case something like this would happen, I,&nbsp;I tried to kill that boy! Because he couldn’t be trusted!”</p><p>“Yujin, Yujin can be trusted!”</p><p>“What are you saying is trustworthy!? Sii, what do you know about this boy!? How long has it been since you’ve met him!? I’ve, I have watched over you since the day you were born! From a distance! But, what are you saying that you know about a boy who you’ve only known for less than 2 months!? Do you know what trust is!? Do you know what belief is!? That sort of irresponsible blind faith! Blind belief! You’re simply being intoxicated by your own self that wants to believe in that boy! You should also know that that’s nothing more than arrogance······.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“You already know······!!”</p><p>It felt like a thunderbolt had just struck.</p><p>Even Yudia, who was raising his spear, and Sophna, who was shouting heatedly, froze in place.</p><p>I paused as well.</p><p>Sii began to cry.</p><p>“You already know······ that it’s arrogance······.”</p><p>Sii.</p><p>“Yup~~······ Miss Sophna······ how is that exactly for my, for Her Excellency the Earl’s sake? Something like that, that’s just arrogance······ you’re just satisfying yourself······ What exactly are you sacrificing? What do you mean by it doesn’t matter if you’re hated? Who’s the one pretending to sacrifice things, but refuses to sacrifice a single thing that they’re trying to arrogantly hold······? Yeah, Miss Sophna.”</p><p>Sii Garno Mikatni.</p><p>“Something like that, you’re just drunk&nbsp;on yourself······.”</p><p>Sii,</p><p>Sii······.</p><p>“If you really care about me, if you’ve really been watching me since I was born, then······ at least once is fine, Miss Sophna, believe in me and Yujin······.”</p><p>“You.”</p><p>Sophna opened her mouth. She shut it.</p><p>She opened it once more.</p><p>“Sii, if that belief turns out wrong, how do you intend to bear that shock······?”</p><p>“That’s also, different······.”</p><p>Sii continued while sniffling.</p><p>“Yujin, Yujin said so. Since this is the most important part, he came here with the person he trusts the most······ He trusts me that much······ But, but yup, I’m different······ I’m also different to what Miss Sophna had said······ I, I don’t trust Yujin that blindly.”</p><p>With eyes wet with tears, Sii turned to look at me.</p><p>“Yup, in the end, I’m that person’s sibling.”</p><p>Sii cleared her throat. It wasn’t until after she sobbed a couple more times did she call out to me.</p><p>“Yujin.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Ah.</p><p>“Don’t betray me. Don’t abandon me. Don’t break, your promise with me. I-If you do.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Aah.</p><p>“If you do, then I’ll tear you apart with my own hands.”</p><p>“Yes, Miss Sii. I will die by your hands.”</p><p>Sii was great.</p><p>Truly great.</p><p>“Yup, Yujin······ Yujin. Yujin······.”</p><p>When did she become this amazing?</p><p>No.</p><p>I most likely realized that she was this great of a child the instant I met her for the first time.</p><p>“I have to admit that I underestimated you.”</p><p>Yudia Batsand spoke.</p><p>“Maid······ Sii. I thought that you were weak. But that does not seem to be the case. I thought that you did not have the right to possess hatred. But that seems to have been wrong. I thought that you were a piece of trash consumed by fear. But it is different. Aah⎯⎯⎯You were actually a strong and marvelous person!”</p><p>He grinned widely and raised his spear.</p><p>“If I kill Yujin right now, then how much would you detest me!? How much would you grow for me!? You! The Earl! The half-siblings who detest one another would combine their strength and detest me! How would it feel to be detested by both sides like that!? Aah, Sii! As expected, you are······.”</p><p>“Stop······.”</p><p>Yudia paused abruptly.</p><p>It was Sophna.</p><p>“You can······ stop now.”</p><p>Sophna kneeled.</p><p>She raised her head.</p><p>She looked up at me and Sii.</p><p>And then at Yudia.</p><p>“Yudia Batsand······ you may leave.”</p><p>Yudia let out a groan. He glared at Sophna while grabbing his chest as if he had been struck by a poisoned arrow. However, shortly after, he set Sii down and patted her head. Sii dodged his hand in disgust, but Yudia didn’t seem to mind as he put his spear away. He then turned around.</p><p>“I will see you next time.”</p><p>Similar to when he had arrived, Yudia left the prison in an instant.</p><hr><p>TL note: Thanks for reading the chapter. I’m sorry for taking so long with this chapter. A lot of things sort of happened at the start of this month, so I couldn’t really focus on translating. I know I’ve been giving these kinds of excuses a lot for the past couple of chapters, but it’s honestly because I haven’t been really feeling that great. And I don’t mean health-wise. I just need some time to sort my thoughts out. I guess I’m sort of relapsing in a way.</p><p>In any case, I’m fine now so you guys don’t have to worry. I just need to get back into my groove. I’ll see you guys in the next chapter. The last two chapters are fairly short.</p>"

Let’s see here. It’s about time.”</p><p>“Yes. Let us begin.”</p><p>Without needing the other side to say so first.</p><p>This lady and Barbatos took out our masks and put them on.</p><p>It was not only the two of us. The majority of the Demon Lords who were watching the performance put on masks as well. Only the 7 betrayers were dubious and started to whisper among one another. They were people that ridiculed not only the factions&nbsp;but the ideal of the Crescent Alliance itself. The embrace of the world is not sufficient enough to forgive them.</p><p>⎯⎯ What is this fuss?</p><p>⎯⎯ Do they intend to hold a surprise concert······?</p><p>⎯⎯ In any case, that child’s performance is rather······.</p><p>It was at that moment.</p><p>Blood splattered here and there from the seats that were arranged for the Demon Lords. The ones wearing masks stabbed, impaled with swords, and hacked with axes the bodies of the ones who were not wearing masks. The ancestral rite ceremony that was tranquil with music instantly turned into a realm of Hell.</p><p>⎯⎯ Wait, what are you······!?</p><p>The traitors rolled on the ground and stretched out their arms. Their bodies were half covered in dirt and half covered in blood. Even if they stretched out their arms and requested for someone to rescue them, be it the Mountain Faction or the Plains Faction, there was no one who would show them mercy. Their fingers were soon stabbed by spears and severed by blades, making them fly throughout the air one finger at a time. Screams and groans mixed together, causing the auditorium to descend into being a slaughterhouse in a flash.</p><p>Those trying to kill people.</p><p>Those trying to not be killed by people.</p><p>Those who are trying to block the people that are attempting to escape.</p><p>Those who use the people beside them as a sacrifice and try to run away.</p><p>This lady spoke emotionlessly.</p><p>“······How should we absorb the military troops of the traitors?”</p><p>“It’d be difficult to manage them, so is there really a need to absorb them?”</p><p>Barbatos yawned. She lifted her wine glass to take a sip, but she then remembered the fact that she was wearing a mask and&nbsp;cursed.</p><p>“Fuck. In any case, just finishing them off would be fine since it’d be easier on the mind. There’s probably a lot of spies hidden among them, anyway. Picking each and every one of them out would be a chore.”</p><p>In that moment, a single Demon Lord rushed to us and groveled on the ground. He was not a member of this lady’s faction. This lady recalls that he was one of the low ranking Demon Lords that Barbatos led around.</p><p>⎯⎯Your Excellency Barbatos! S-Save me! Those people went insane and are······!</p><p>However, before he could even finish his sentence. The air was split by Barbatos’ light downward hand gesture, and that formless blade decapitated the man’s head just like that. With its head gone, the body shook back and forth before falling backwards with a thud. Barbatos yawned once more.</p><p>“Haamm. We should have done this sooner.

And remember guys, if you want to say hi to me, then feel free to drop by the Discord(Link on the left). Moreover, if you appreciate how I’ve been translating things, then I’d be more than glad if you guys left something at my patreon! I’ve been receiving&nbsp;a lot of support from you guys and it feels great to know that you guys have been really enjoying my translation style.</p><p>In any case, I wish you guys all have a good day and look forward to more from me later on!

      "title": "Chapter 34 - Volume 4",
      "url": "https://novgo.net/dungeon-defense/chapter-34-volume-4.html",
      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><h4><strong>Afterword</strong></h4><hr><p>Nowadays, I have been writing while going to and leaving the office together with my friends. Since I cannot write well at home, let’s write while outside of home, with that thought in mind, I made a mutual understanding. After leaving for work at 7AM and typing away at the typewriter, just at the moment when I felt delighted because of the fact that I am able to write better here than when I am at home, a sudden realization came to be a step late: I started writing because I didn’t like commuting every day to a company, but isn’t this no different to working at a company······?</p><p>However, realization has always been something that came late to me, and since I have already made a contract, I have no other choice but to continue this office life for at least 1 year. For that reason, this is an afterword that is being typed out much after the main text.</p><p>First things first, my gratitude towards the illustrator of 〈Dungeon Defense〉, cocorip. And also my unstinted worship and praise. Although I always contemplate on what I should write in the afterword, there is a single thing that does not require any thought, and that is my compliments towards cocorip. That’s because, similar to how we don’t hesitate whenever we write self-evident facts like ‘1+1=2’, my fingers do not waver even slightly whenever I write praises about cocorip’s illustrations. Although cocorip’s color illustrations and monochrome illustrations have always been top-tier since a long time ago, the illustrations in volume 4 almost felt as if they were pointing at the other illustrations until now and emanating a last boss-like dignity while uttering “That was not merazoma. It was a mera······.”. Since even the weather and scenery, which should be difficult to express in a black and white illustration, were done perfectly, I am contemplating on whether I should go and make a religion where we worship the illustrator. Even if I don’t particularly spread the belief, there are already several believers among the other authors who have gathered so it’s not impossible. Ah, oh mighty God! Please continue to look after me.<em>(TL note: ‘Merazoma’ and ‘Mera’ are skills from Dragon Quest. Merazoma being the stronger version of Mera)</em></p><p>An audio drama CD is being released along with this volume 4. The events that happen in the drama CD occurs around 1 month before Laura De Farnese gives her speech. Since it was my first time working on an audio drama, I was watching the voice actors/voice actresses, musicians, and directors working on scene, with anticipation. Compared to other audio dramas, I tried writing the script with a feeling that’s close to that of a general comedy, but if other people were all able to enjoy the recording process, then I couldn’t be any happier. Voice actor Nam Dohyeong who played the role of Dantalian, voice actress Jeong Hyaewon who played the role of Laura De Farnese, and voice actress Kim Chaeha who played the role of Lapis Lazuli, thank you all for your hard work!</p><div></div><p>As expected, the opening song and the ending song that were included with the audio drama were splendid beyond description. Although the two songs have a different feeling to them, I believe that they both magnificently have an aspect of &lt;Dungeon Defense&gt; contained within them. (The ending song, &lt;Desert Rose&gt;, was even sung passionately by the voice actor Nam Dohyeong, during the Anime Sound Festival!)</p><p>I express my thanks to the director, singer, voice actors/voice actresses, composers, lyricists, production director, design director, and the editor who was able to connect all of this together.</p><p>This manuscript was late beyond imagination. The responsibility for the late manuscript is completely on me. I thought that I would be able to complete the manuscript by September, but what’s this? It became late and late again and at some point, it had become December. During even September, October, and November, I asked the editorial department if they could wait a bit longer······, and on all such occasions, my editor waited patiently. I have no excuse for this delay that lasted for no less than 3 months. I can only feel apologetic towards the editor that is in charge of me.</p><p>The last people who I wish to thank is, just like always, you readers.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, the manuscript for volume 4 was postponed several times. Despite that, towards the readers who waited, picked this book up, and read all the way to this point, I can only say that I am sorry for the late release and also that if you were able to have even the slightest bit of an enjoyable read, then it is a relief······. Thank you. Just the thought of volume 01 to volume 04 of &lt;Dungeon Defense&gt; being placed in a row on one of my reader’s bookshelf, fills me with deep jovial thought. As much as how the days of commuting to an office will continue for me, I will endeavor to release the next volume faster than the previous ones.</p>"

This is possibly the shortest volume in the series, but that doesn’t make it any less impressive than the other volumes. It was an amazing read through with a lot of twists and revelations.&nbsp;There’s actually a LOT of bants in this volume so look forward to those, since I’ll be looking forward to translating those lines.</p><p>This volume might actually take me longer to translate since the format is rather complex in places. Like how this entire prologue was in black pages in contrast to the white pages. Between each chapter, there’ll be these black page segments, so I’ll need to figure out how I’ll portray this to you guys properly. I also didn’t expect each image to stick right next to each other, so I had to manually put a space between each page. If I didn’t, then you’d see these unnatural gaps in between the lines. By manually spacing it, you guys can tell where the page ends and where the next page starts. I’ll make the next black page section a bit different and see how you guys like that. After that, I’ll ask which format you guys prefer.</p><p>I apologize to those of you who have the tendency of copying and pasting certain lines to threads or forums. Only the black page sections will be like this, so please bear with it.</p>"

Live solely through avarice.</strong></h4><hr><h4><strong>Prologue</strong></h4><h4>▯Blood Relative Killer, Imperial Princess of the Empire,&nbsp;Elizabeth von Habsburg Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day&nbsp;10 Polles, Bruno Plains, Army of the Crusaders</h4><p>The night became cold once the spring rain had abated. Puddles of water that were left behind by the rain were scattered here and there throughout the camp and were slowly drying. I see that water dries well even during the night.</p><p>Ever since that day I played Black and White Flags against Demon Lord Dantalian, I have picked up the habit of carefully listening to the sound of nothing. If you inadvertently listen to these nothings, then you will come to realize that those nothings are actually beating as something. It was night. The candlelight wavered firmly as it burned my body, and while it wavered, it also shed light on the words that I had held in my hand.</p><p>— Month 4, Day 10. Late evening. Enemy camp, in the middle of holding an ancestral rite, a purge was carried out. Although it felt as if an internal strife was about to occur, it was quickly quelled. It can be assumed that Demon Lord Barbatos and Demon Lord Paimon are behind this. The surveillance is strict.</p><p>It was a note that was torn into a smaller piece of paper because the writer could only write a few lines. This spy had pressed down on a shard of graphite in order to write this, but considering how the letters were jagged, it is clear that this was not written on top of a flat surface. I could feel this spy’s desperate loyalty from these ruggedly written words.</p><p>······I see that this is a secret message that was sent after being hastily written. Beautiful.</p><p>Several crows were obediently lowering their bodies on top of my desk. Demonkind treated crows auspiciously, so they did not hunt them down carelessly. I had planted spies deeply into the shadows of the things that the enemy treated with caution. I removed another note from the ankle of a different crow and spread it out before me.</p><p>— Month 4, Day 10. Evening. A disturbance occurred amidst the enemy forces. As Demon Lords took the lives of other Demon Lords, the enemy forces were split into several parts. While they split apart, mixed together, and struck back, the enemy general, Laura De Farnese, performed. It is chaotic. It is difficult to conjecture more from what can be seen.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>The words were neat and straight. It was a report that was written leisurely. I carefully peered at the sight of the note being dyed yellow as the candlelight continued to&nbsp;burn.</p><p>I opened my mouth and spoke to my head maid.</p><p>“Julia.”</p><p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p><p>“Do you know when I became aware of the destiny of an emperor?”</p><p>“How could this one dare speak about the duty of an emperor?”</p><p>“It was when I was little.”</p><p>The head maid bowed deeply. The head maid was a girl who would quietly keep me company even when I would pass the time talking to myself. To this child, that was her duty as my loyal subject.</p><p>“Evening after evening, every corner of the imperial palace would be radiant due to the abundant number of candlelights. As I thawed my body, I would become curious about something as I stared at a candle that was lighting up a corner. Why, if you go to look at the candles that should have melted the day before, you will see that, on the day after, all of the candles would have recovered completely and be burning once more. My young self was in awe.&nbsp;······So they resurrect. Ah, every night, the candles resurrect in order to brighten the next approaching night.”</p><p>As I unfolded the news that the crows had brought from several distances away one note at a time, I continued my story.</p><p>“That was what I had regarded as evidence of God’s descent. Because I was in both awe and astonishment, be it my tutor or my elder brother, I had told everyone about it. Impious fellows would go around clamoring that God did not exist, but that was merely the foolish mumblings of the people who have only lived during the day. God is a very shy individual, so he only wanders around the palace at night.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“No one believed me. If anything, they jeered at me.”</p><p>Thus I decided to confirm it.</p><p>“It was night.”</p><p>I snuck out of my bedroom and hid in a hallway where many candles had melted. My heart was pounding because of the thought that I was about to bear witness to the sight of God roaming around at night.</p><p>“Even the attendants had gone to sleep, so while the palace was silent, the sounds of the guards’ footsteps, the sound of an old soldier coughing up phlegm, and the whir of the wind, these nothings remained quiet as they continued to be nothing······.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>It was when I was little.</p><p>The sounds of the guards’ footsteps were simply a clamor of steps within the halls, and as the sound of coughing up phlegm was a noise that ominously shook the air, the whir of the wind was the sound of time being wasted tediously. I had yet to learn how to carefully listen to these nothings. During that season where nearly everything was nothing, my heart pounded furiously at the thought of seeing God, and at that time, the entire world was playing a variation of the tune which came from my beating heart.</p><p>How long did I have to wait?</p><p>“Someone approached the candlelit hall. The footsteps were much too normal for them to be called the footsteps of God. The person’s form was also much too pitiable for it to be called the appearance of God. Regardless, before the man had drawn closer to the candles, I still believed that he was God. I simply thought that God was magnanimous enough to be comfortable with even normal and pitiable things. Soon after, once I witnessed God extinguish the dying ember of a candle, replace the melted candle with a new one, and set the new candle ablaze, I came to a realization⎯⎯⎯that that wasn’t God.”</p><p>He was just a normal attendant.</p><p>He was simply a pitiable human.</p><p>Before I knew it, I was ruminating over the past with my eyes closed.</p><p>“Julia. That night was quite dreary. What I had seen was a normal and pitiable attendant on night duty, but what I had done was conjecture something more than what could be seen. The candles did not resurrect. They were merely replaced.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“Since the candles were replaced every day, it is clear that there was someone who made those candles every day. Since there was a person who made a living by solely making candles every day, it is also indisputable that there was another person who cultivated, harvested, and handed that candlemaker their food.”</p><p>I was not aware that those subjects, those jobs were a major part of the crown land. I have never seen the artisan who made a living by making candles. I have never seen the farmers and I have never seen the blacksmiths who made those farmers their farming equipment. However, as the candle was replaced right before my eyes and shining brightly⎯⎯⎯similar to how the burning candlelight was clear and certain, the subjects that I couldn’t see with my eyes were also clear and certain.</p><div></div><p>The people existed.</p><p>From that point forth, every world shone as lights in my eyes.</p><p>People and people were just connected over flames and flames.</p><p>I only learned what that clear and evidently burning candlelight was called later on.</p><p>“Do you understand, Julia?”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“On that day, I lost God and gained a nation.”</p><p>I opened my eyes.</p><p>Once my eyes were open, I turned to look at the maids.</p><p>“The monarch which you all serve does not believe in the resurrection of God. I am not religious. If I were to have a doctrine, then it would simply be the doctrine of a candlelight. My creed would be for the candlelight to protect the night perennially, without end. As I look into my candlelight, I unravel and fathom the people from a distance. Do you all consider me to be blasphemous?”</p><p>Julia knelt down and the other maids followed suit by lowering themselves.</p><p>“We humble servants have always been in awe of Your Highness.”</p><p>“Although I may have many duties as an emperor, once you have conjectured more from what can be seen, that is when it can be finally established. I shall ask you this. Do you all believe in my perception?”</p><p>“Please command us. We shall obey.”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“Summon the commanders. Since it is the middle of the night, you will have to wake them up with caution. If they ask why they are being called, then tell them to bring their weapons. If they ask for a deeper cause, then inform them that the Imperial Princess has forbidden you from answering any more questions.”</p><p>“Should we summon all of them?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The commanders had all gathered by the time it took for a candle to melt by half of a handbreadth. The night was chilly because the spring rain had receded. Because they did not know the reason why they were gathered during the night, the lips of the commanders were dry. I gave a command.</p><p>“I heard that a wicked booklet has been circulating within our forces. They say that the speech of the enemy general was copied down and is being passed around among the common soldiers, nurturing traitorous thoughts within their minds. If these traitorous thoughts grow, then will they not eventually become a rebellion? It is said that a nation is a giant tree where the roots are placed within the hearts of the people. Do you all not think that the roots would become firm if you remove the weed before they can cause corrosion? Commanders, heed my words.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p><p>“With my concern for those roots as the cause, I command you. I shall allow you all to take a leave of absence tonight. Utilize the subordinates who you believe are trustworthy and raid every single tent. Turn them inside out. If you find one of these booklets within a tent, then execute every single soldier that was assigned to that tent. Do not take their lives while causing an uproar. You must not allow the farmers to&nbsp;needlessly&nbsp;sing as you pull out the weed. Behead them.”</p><p>The commanders lowered their bodies to the ground.</p><p>“All of them?”</p><p>“All of them.”</p><p>It was night.</p><p>There were flames billowing here and there throughout the military encampment, brightening the dark night. There was a decapitated corpse submerged within each puddle of water which the moisture of the spring rain had left behind.</p><p>The soldier who was raising his voice in order to claim that he was innocent was beheaded in the middle of his assertion. His head fell into a mire and muddy water flowed into his gaping maw. The surface level of the puddle shrank accordingly to the amount of muddy water the mouth of the corpse had swallowed. Like so, the puddles all around dried up completely.</p><p>I see that water dries well even during the night.</p><p>—O Goddess of All who resides in the clearest of skies, please do not toss away these deeply sinful children even if they arrive at your doorsteps, and simply look after them with mercy and tolerance. We shall bury their earthly corpses, so, O Goddess of All, please reap their heavenly spirits. Although we know how to bury the dead, we do not know how to bury their souls, so we can only look up at you, O Goddess of All, for your wisdom······.</p><p>Priests chanted reclusively as they roamed around the camp. Because a saintess who claimed to be from the Temple of Artemis was leading the Hymn of the Faithfully Departed, the commanders apathetically left the group of apostles alone. As expected, I had no reason to obstruct the hearts of the priests who wished to soothe the spirits with their hymn.</p><p>I passed the note that was written by the second spy to my head maid.</p><p>“Julia. The person who had written this is a traitor who has submitted to the side of demonkind.”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>“As the day was chaotic, how was this individual able to find the time to write down their words so neat and properly? A disturbance had occurred and this person should have also been caught up in that disturbance, but as you can see, they had tipped off the people above them and obtained the time to leisurely write their report. Attach a separate spy on this person. Kill them before half a month can pass.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>The head maid bowed.</p><p>“As you command.”</p><p>I turned my head and gazed out towards the other side of the Bruno Plains. It was deep into the night so the enemy encampment could not be seen. Although the enemy encampment was not visible, solely the outline of the tower of human skulls which the demons had piled up towards the sky could be vaguely seen under the moonlight.</p><p>Laura Farnese must be performing there. I see that the child who was nothing had barely become something after being taken in by Dantalian. Therefore, the child was performing for Dantalian who had molded her into something.</p><p>In the end, can that be beautiful?</p><p>Even a life that is completely dependent on someone else.</p><p>······.</p><p>Even that.</p><p>As I listened to the sound of flames flowing through the night, I pondered that thought.</p><hr><p>TL note: Thanks for reading the chapter. This prologue was rather difficult to translate partially due to me still being sick and also because Elizabeth is often vague with her words and uses a lot of metaphors. So yeah, this prologue may be confusing for some of you guys.</p><p>In any case, similar to volume 4, I don’t plan to split the chapters for volume 5 into parts (The chapters are all 15k+ words). The chapters are quite long, longer than the ones in volume 4, but I prefer a more coherent reading experience. I may make exceptions if some real-life problem occurs down the road, but I’ll make a post about it if that does happen.</p><p>I can’t give an accurate estimate on how long it’ll take me to translate chapter 1 since I have such a chaotic schedule this month, but I’ll do my best. I’m free from public service on the 20th, so my chaotic schedule should vanish at that point. You can check for progress updates in the #announcement channel of my discord server.</p><p>P.S Welcome the return of DD!</p>"

My father wanted his household to be a hunting ground that raised the strong. Even a gap where opium could be planted was not allowed in his household.</p><p>My father had once sat at the dining table and said this:</p><p>“The trend of religion has passed. To be a little more exact, even now, the trend is in the middle of withering away.”</p><p>It was obvious what my father wanted from his children. He wanted us to grow up into beasts that could rip through anything. Religion was the easiest livestock to rip the flesh off of. My father’s scoffing was easily passed down onto us.</p><p>At that time, besides us, our mothers were also seated at the dining room table, but there was one among them who was religious. From what I can remember, she was from a family that had very strict religious traditions. Nevertheless, I have never seen her give a retort to my father’s jeers.</p><p>She would simply pray by herself for 5 seconds before every meal. By doing so, she would narrowly overlook the various responses. My father would end up smiling bitterly before saying,</p><p>‘Well. It can’t be helped.’</p><p>At those times, his tone would nearly sound as if he were simply allowing his silly lover to have her few seconds of freedom.</p><p>She behaved like a heretic with deep sins. She didn’t raise her voice when memorizing scriptures, nor did she meet up with other believers in private. No, she didn’t even preach to her own child about religious doctrines. A silent tribute before a meal. 5 seconds. It felt as if that was all there was to her faith.</p><p>The time I witnessed the sight of her praying was almost close to a coincidence. Looking back at it now, I’m uncertain whether that was actually a prayer or not. Every once in a while, trivially peculiar things happen to me. During those times, I have trivially peculiar thoughts. This story is like that as well.</p><p>I had shut myself in the study on that day. I had done so because the mothers were occupying the living room and having a large quarrel. They were so loud that the sound of the argument between mothers had even seeped through the door crevice of the study.</p><p>— This is my home. My and that person’s home. How dare you uneducated people thoughtlessly set foot······.</p><p>— If someone here is going to leave, then it should be you! It’s all your fault after all. Last time and this time as well, all of it······.</p><p>— Please, if we think before we speak, then······.</p><p>Arguments like this occurred at the drop of a hat.</p><p>There was nothing significant about it. No matter how loud their dispute on whether I’m the whore or she’s the whore got, the mothers were consistent when it came to turning a blind eye to what was actually the most important conclusion, in other words, the fact that it was my father who was the worst motherfucker in the universe. At the very least, it was like that when they fought among themselves. In this house, as my father was like an inviolable existence, to them, everyone excluding themselves was a whore.</p><p>In that moment, someone had run into the study. It was her. She must have been struck by someone as her lips were bleeding. Soon after, something bewildering occurred. The moment she and I made eye contact, she burst into tears.</p><p>I calmly comforted her and stroked her shoulder. I wonder how much time passed. She grasped my hand and wept.</p><p>“Forgive your mothers. Forgive your father. Forgive us. Every day, aah. Truly, I repent my sins every day······ Truly······.”</p><p>It felt as if I had been slapped since my head went blank.</p><p>She continued to mutter while keeping her head lowered.</p><p>“Please forgive us. As I shall repent my sins, please take pity on the sins which I could not repent. Please forgive us······.”</p><p>The person who she was pleading for forgiveness from was most likely not me. She wasn’t crying to me, but to her God after all.</p><p>At a glance, it felt as if she had succeeded. As her cries traveled an incredible distance when she wept, it almost sounded as if it were not here.</p><p>How desperate her voice was. It was to an extent that it nearly fooled even me. If she had not shed her tears on me, if her tears had not stained my clothes, then there was a chance that I might have actually believed that God had heard her cries.</p><p>At the very most, the only place where her tears could drench was my clothes. The only place that would willingly be drenched by her tears was also my clothes. I then understood that this was the problem of everything.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I comforted her for a long time before sending her back out of the study. I sat down on a chair and fell into deep thought. Who could forgive that person’s sins?</p><p>She had cried to God. Or maybe she had cried towards her entire life. However, as I am not a God, it was not her entire life even more. No matter who it was. What can anyone do for her? Who can declare the innocence of a human?</p><p>The place outside of the door was still dreary with the sound of fighting.</p><p>— Last time as well, because we had done everything the way you wanted······.</p><p>— No, it’s because you were so needlessly persistent······.</p><p>— Please, if you’re going to fight, then do it outside······.</p><p>I picked up the book that I was reading earlier.</p><p>The words were not registering in my eyes. Only sound. As it was the sound of fighting that had started before I was born and will be the sound of fighting that will continue even after my father’s death, this continued to echo in my head.</p><p>Even the cry that had been burying itself into my clothes a second ago was mixed in over there. The sound of crying and the sound of voices feasted upon each other and disgorged one another. I felt dizzy. There were only a few words that reached my ear and could be heard distinctly.</p><p>All your.</p><p>No, you.</p><p>Please.</p><p>That was it.</p><p>The musical melody of Beethoven, which I had turned on, was flowing through the study. ‘From darkness to light’, this was supposedly a quote from Beethoven. I did not know how many gaps I had to cross, nor did I know how many the gaps had to be in order for my life to become a single melody.</p><p>This was what I was simply unaware of.</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st,&nbsp;Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 10</p><p>Polles, Bruno Plains, Army of the Crescent Alliance</p><p>“Sinner Dantalian, listen.”</p><p>My trial was carried out in a simple fashion. It happened late in the night.</p><p>Once the afternoon sun shone down on the season where the spring rain had just ended, the world became humid. That humidity continued on even into the evening. As I was still seated inside of the prison, I received the steam that was wandering somewhere between the late spring and early summer with my bare skin.</p><p>According to the judge,</p><p>“A few days ago, you had basked in the glory of being selected as the representative to give the speech of the Crescent Alliance to announce the start of war. You, however, had dared to nominate the lowly blood of a human and, as a result, you had disgraced your blood allies. Although you are the representative of all of demonkind, since the one you had chosen to act in your place was a human, at the very least, you have thrown away your obligations, and at most, you have sullied the customs of demonkind. Your sin is tremendous.”</p><p>is what I had done.</p><p>I don’t know if my sin is tremendous or not, but the only thought that was going through my head was that the camp was tremendously noisy even during the night. The purge was currently in a present progressive form. Although the Demon Lords who were revealed as traitors were all beheaded, there were still soldiers who were loyal to those decapitated heads, so a slaughter of the highest acclaim was occurring at the bottom of the hill.</p><p>— ······.</p><p>Farnese was still performing there. The performance that had started late in the evening did not stop even when a quarter of a day had passed. It happened late in the night. In the center of where soldiers were killing soldiers and soldiers were being killed by soldiers, Farnese’s fingers flew across the piano keys as she relied on the torches that were lighting various areas of the camp.</p><p>The witches were convoying my trial from a distance and muttering to each other.</p><p>“Seriously, if she’s going to keep that up, then how long does Miss General intend to perform—?”</p><p>“I don’t know. A lot of stuff must have piled up in her mind as she lived her life. If she can release her large amount of stress by doing that, then it’d be a relief.”</p><p>“Do you think I asked that question because I didn’t knooow that? I asked that because her song is shady. From a good perspective, it’s a song overflowing with madness, and from a bad perspective, it’s just a crazy song. Either way, it doesn’t change the fact that our general is a slightly crazy bitch.”</p><p>“You’re hearing it like that because your knowledge of art is exceedingly lacking. Even if the things you’re lacking in isn’t just one or two things, among those things, you’re overwhelmingly lacking in your knowledge of art. Similar to how only humans appear in the eyes of humans, only crazy bitches appear in the eyes of crazy bitches, so the phenomenon where General Farnese appears like a crazy bitch to you just proves the fact that you’re a crazy bitch. Wow. I was really fucking logical just now.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Aha. Do you want to be fucking logically beat up?”</p><p>“If you want to prove me wrong, then try composing a decent song yourself.”</p><p>“Aaall right. I’ll start composing right away. You provoked me. For starters, once you play my song, then thooose corpses that died over there will spring up and start dancing, and even Master Dantalian’s penis will stand up and dance fancifully. Just you wait······.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>I wonder if it’s because the witches were rattling on endlessly. The judge’s expression changed into a frown. Similarly, the demon soldiers the judge had brought also had quite the bad complexion. The witches were no different to outcasts. It must be unpleasant. Although it should be my role as their master to stop them, who cares? I left them alone.</p><p>Because the girl who came here as the judge was a bit annoying.</p><p>“Haa.”</p><p>In the end, the judge stopped reading out my sentencing and let out a sigh.</p><p>“······Heey. It’d be nice if you listened to me a bit seriously. This isn’t someone else’s sentencing but yours, Skinnybones. No matter how much this may be just for the sake of formality, goofing off so blatantly like that is going too far, isn’t it?”</p><p>The judge was none other than Demon Lord Sitri.</p><p>Paimon’s close aide, the girl who had at one point tried to poison me to death was reading my crime to me. Sitri’s expression would become vague when she rebuked me for my wrongdoing, but it felt like that was because she herself knew that she had nothing to be ashamed about. If that weren’t the case? Then she’s a fucking bastard.</p><p>The problem was the issue regarding whether Sitri was a fucking bastard or a fucking bitch.</p><p>“I have no idea what you may be talking about, Your Honor. I am already focused. In truth, I am so focused that it almost feels as if I cannot be any more focused than this. I am so concentrated that if I were to be any more concentrated than this, then, on the contrary, I would no longer be able to concentrate.”</p><p>“Yeah, so that’s why you’re fervently staring at my crotch even now?”</p><p>“It is a territory that deserves to be academically researched.”</p><p>“You mean a territory that deserves to be pervertedly indulged in, you pervert.”</p><p>Rank 12th, Demon Lord Sitri was a hermaphrodite. This meant that she possessed both a pΟnis and vΟgina at the same time, but a king can’t possibly utter such vulgar words like simultaneous possessor of a pΟnis and a vΟgina, so I am making do by elegantly referring to her as a hermaphrodite. I am a gentleman who knows courtesy after all.</p><p>“How is it like, Your Highness Sitri? Is there a difference between the pleasure you bask in when using your male genitalia and the bliss you experience when using your female genitalia? Although I have heard many times before that the pleasure which the female genitalia experience is much greater than its male counterpart, there is not much to that statement if I am not provided proof. There is a possibility that the type of sexual pleasure itself is different. Since the sensation of being rammed and doing the ramming are completely different, the very act of ruthlessly lumping those two together and calling it sexual pleasure may possibly be mistaken. If that is the case, then it would be an issue of preference. Your Highness Sitri. Your Respectable Honor. It may be presumptuous of me to ask, but between being rammed and doing the ramming, which act is more to your taste, Your Honor?”</p><p>“Yup, you pervert. You’re already perverted and not only are you perverted to the point that it feels as if you cannot be any more perverted than this,&nbsp;you’re so perverted that if you somehow do become more perverted than this, then at that point, you’d have already stopped being a pervert and have become something else.”</p><p>This was a ridiculous slander. Honestly speaking, I was slightly shocked. Even if this woman⎯⎯⎯this man⎯⎯⎯no, this woman, no this man, in short, this person who could either be a fucking bitch or a fucking bastard, this Demon Lord who I have yet to determine if they’re a fucking bastard or a fucking bitch so, in short, I’ll refer to them as Schrodinger’s fuck⎯⎯⎯even if she was simply reading straight from the untampered manuscript which was written by both Barbatos and Paimon, if you consider her statement just now, it was dubious as to whether she was actually maintaining neutrality as the judge or not. To be honest, it was also doubtful as to whether there were enough brain cells stored inside that skull or not. However, this might be a bit of a rude suspicion to have. Whenever I find myself in a situation where it is difficult to tell whether the opposition in front of me has brain cells or not, I was on the side of believing that they did. I am still a gentleman who knows courtesy after all······.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“That is certainly true. Our Master Dantalian is indeed a perverted pervert.”</p><p>“Yup. Our master and the word pervert are so closely connected to one another, that it’s quite difficult to claim that he isn’t a pervert. Not only is it incredibly difficult to do, but if you deny the fact that our master is a pervert, then it’d feel like you’re denying our master’s very being. In other words, this means that Master Dantalian’s very essence is perverted. Ah. I was really fucking logical just now.”</p><p>“How strange. It seems logic has changed without my knowledge.”</p><p>“By the way, what are you scribbling on that parchment? How dare you do something else even though we’re discussing the fact that our master is a pervert.”</p><p>“I’m writing a song. What’s so new about the fact that Master Dantalian is a pervert that you girls need to babble about it? If anything, you all might as well babble about the fact that the sun will also rise in the morning tomorrow and also set at night tomorrow since that will at least bestow upon all of your lacking sense of&nbsp;culture a smidgeon of new knowledge. More importantly, in order to prove my knowledge of art, I’m in the middle of composing an amazing song, a song that humanity has never heard of thus far and never will in the future.”</p><p>“I wonder about that. From what I can tell, I feel like your statement just now is actually the bullshit that humanity has never heard of thus far and never will in the future······.”</p><p>“Now that I think about it, I heard a rumor that Master Dantalian slept with General Farnese.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>“What do re mi did you say?”</p><p>“Beautiful. A magnificent chorus. Good. If we add our ensemble to the general’s performance, then it’ll make it even better. It’s only right for crazy bitches to sing for a song played by a crazy bitch. Sing, you bitches. Dance, you bitches. Let us hold our own Walpurgis Night by ourselves.”</p><p>“What did you say la ti fa mi re dooo—?”</p><p>“Damn it, that’s a bit too much. You went too far. The chorus ended up coming to a halt as soon as it had begun because of some psychotic bitch. This is why singing with crazy bitches is quite the difficult task. They’re quite the crazy bitches after all.”</p><p>“Wait a second. If that rumor is true, then why doesn’t Master even look our way even though he’s slept with the general? Though I shouldn’t be the one to talk,&nbsp;from our and the general’s appearances, our ages don’t&nbsp;look that far apart, right? To be honest, we’re pretty much the same. We’re similarly young. Why am I hearing this rumor about our master sleeping with General Farnese for the first time?”</p><p>“That can be answered with a very simple response. Because it’s a rumor that I made up just now.”</p><p>“This fucking bitch?”</p><p>“So what were we talking about?”</p><p>“We were talking about Master Dantalian being a pervert.”</p><p>“We were talking about how Master Dantalian slept with the general just now.”</p><p>“Dear Lord. Is that true? Really, Master. You can’t live like such a pervert. A person should live with some courtesy.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>And my witches were fellows who had shoved something like courtesy into a food waste disposal bin. These damned girls.</p><p>“These sluts who wouldn’t even be satisfying to chew to death⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>Rustle.</p><p>It was at the instant that the commander whom Sitri had brought pulled out his sword.</p><p>The witches who were chatting and cackling among themselves raised their staffs and aimed them at the throats of the soldiers. It was night. Shadows that were clearly not cast by the night wrapped around the necks of the soldiers like octopus tentacles. They wickedly flicked around as if they could lick the necks of the soldiers and deprive them of their lives at any moment.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>The commander gulped. In the distance, although the slaughter under the pretext of purging was still noisy and the song that Farnese was performing was also prominent, this place, because this hill where my prison cell was located was like the eye of the storm placed at the very center of all the clamor, the sound of someone gulping was bleak.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Well?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The witches tilted their heads. The angle and speed with which the witches had tilted their heads were identical. While obliquely tilting their heads at the same speed and angle, the witches smiled gaily.</p><p>“Is it your first time seeing crazy bitches?”</p><p>“······,&nbsp;······.”</p><p>“Mm. Sir. You. Mister. I don’t think this is our first meeting. I remember seeing your face somewhere. Where was it? Ahahah. Where did I witness this punk’s faaace?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Aha, the witch then uttered.</p><p>“Yotvingian Plains. The assembly area of the Crescent Alliaaance.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“That’s right. That’s when I saw you. That’s when you showed your face, while moving those trivial eyes. While wagging that dirty mouth. Yup. I saw you then. What did you prattle on about at that tiiime? My dear comrades, my beloved ladies. Do you remember—?”</p><p>“I remember.”</p><p>“I remember.”</p><p>“I remember well.”</p><p>“His Highness Dantalian was leading the troops and passing through the humble encampment, but they obstructed our path. They threw snowballs at us. It was piles of snow that were smeared in mud. We had no other choice but to protect His Highness with our lowly bodies. We didn’t even hope that someone would wipe our bodies, but His Highness personally wiped our clothes clean.”</p><p>The witches giggled in a low tone. Their laughter easily seeped into the low air of the night sky. The laughter flowing from the witches was uniquely light. I believed that that was the case because they had thrown away their lives somewhere. As their proof for having thrown it away somewhere, the witches cackled as they pulled up something that had happened a fair while ago.</p><p>— For Your Honor’s mistress to be an outcast, general to be a human, and royal bodyguards to be witches, Your Honor’s good faith impales the sky. Indeed, it’s befitting of the King of Peasants.</p><p>— You must be very fortunate to be so popular with women, Your Honor! Please teach the people how to bed lowly harlots and spread the information throughout the world.</p><p>— Does Your Honor plan to cut us lowly subjects down? That’s fine. Since Your Honor had stabbed the throat of His Highness Andromalius in order to save the life of a succubus whore, then killing dozens or hundreds of us lowly subjects for the sake of those witches should also be possible, right?</p><p>— Please step over our corpses with Your Honor’s grace.</p><p>Although it was something that had happened a fairly long time ago, the witches remembered it well as it was not something that had occurred quite a long time ago.</p><p>Each witch took a role and they&nbsp;recited to each other the lines which the soldiers had uttered on that day. As they continued to recite the lines, the shadows that were digging into the necks of the soldiers dug in further. The sound of gulping resonated here and there.</p><p>“Master?”</p><p>“Our master.”</p><p>“These fellows took out their swords first so how should they be tortured?”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“How unsightly. But how can they be used if they are killed just because they are unsightly?”</p><p>“Then what should be done?”</p><p>“Kill only one.”</p><p>Blood scattered.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>It happened late in the night.</p><p>The front of the spring rain had battered the Habsburg Empire and it wasn’t until three or four days ago that the rain had departed a bit towards the south. The rain clouds had sprayed an abundant supply of water on the ground, allusively proving its legacy. On the horizon of the Bruno Plains, only the puddles of water heading south were infinite. When the numerous torches spread throughout the encampment shines on those surfaces of water, it becomes beautiful as the puddles become radiant.</p><p>At the bottom of the hill, in that nirvana that was half-water and half-dirt, unknown soldiers were shouting fiercely. Although I could not see the soldiers, the torches displayed their shadows and those shadows shouted with their black maws.</p><p>— Kill the traitors!</p><p>The legs of the shadows were buried up to their calves in each pool of muddy water. Within the vicinity of their buried calves, as one might suspect, the mouth of some unknown corpse was submerged. The mouths could not possibly drink all of the muddy water. Be that as it may, they could not disgorge the water either.</p><p>They were merely submerged underneath the surface of the water.</p><p>They merely sank as if they were in a swamp.</p><p>Muddy water entered the opened mouths of the corpses and the surface levels of the pools shrunk according to the extent of those mouths. It felt as if that was the corpses’ way of digging their own graves. It was a gravesite all around.</p><p>—&nbsp;······.</p><p>In the center of the land that was filled with graves in every direction, Farnese continued to perform her song. The night sky overshadowed the world, making it seem as if everything was wrapped in black vinyl. On that surface, Farnese’s performance became gloss and simmered. In each spot that the starlight shone down upon, the girl’s performance crawled up like a snake’s tongue and licked the lower parts of the starlight.</p><p>Thus, as the spewed up clamorous cries from the shadows formed a low key and Farnese’s escalating sound formed a major key, the already dead corpses occasionally sunk down to the bottom as silence, resulting in music resonating throughout the land that was filled with graves.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>— Kill them!</p><p>The shadows shouted. Or perhaps, their mouths did.</p><p>—&nbsp;······.</p><p>Farnese performed. Or perhaps, her fingers did.</p><p>— Slaughter them······.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-97302\" src=\"https://images2-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&amp;gadget=a&amp;no_expand=1&amp;resize_h=0&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fshalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com%2f2017%2f10%2feb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-40.jpg%3fw%3d700\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" srcset=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-40.jpg?w=700 700w, https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-40.jpg?w=103 103w, https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-40.jpg?w=205 205w, https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-40.jpg?w=768 768w, https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-40.jpg 820w\" alt=\"던전 디펜스 - Volume 5 - Page 40\" data-attachment-id=\"97302\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/dungeon-defense-volume-5-chapter-1/%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-5-page-40/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-40.jpg?w=700\" data-orig-size=\"820,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"던전 디펜스 – Volume 5 – Page 40\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-40.jpg?w=700?w=205\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-40.jpg?w=700?w=700\"></p><p>Perhaps the eyes being black with rage would be preferable. While the corpses were stepped on along with the mud and the mud rotted away along with the corpses, eyes that were useless no matter what they looked at, maws that could not be quenched no matter what they drank, and fingers that did not particularly matter regardless of what they pointed at. As they pointed at those unpardonable traitors.</p><p>The sound itself was shouting.</p><p>As a result of using Farnese as my proxy to spread poison throughout the world, they were shouting while gaping their mouths wide open and the corpses passed away with their maws stuck in the ground. As the torches illuminated brightly due to that sound, clamor, and silence⎯⎯⎯when they become a single shadow and swell⎯⎯⎯ah, at that time, my life knew&nbsp;nearly&nbsp;no bounds.</p><p>All of that was the state of enlightenment which I had brought about during the single week I was in prison.</p><p>Victory was nice.</p><p>Furthermore, it was occasionally beautiful.</p><p>“That,”</p><p>After breaking the long silence, Sitri spoke.</p><p>“was a subordinate I cherished quite a bit.”</p><p>“Is that so? This is unfortunate.”</p><p>I turned my head with difficulty after staring at that nirvana for a while. Turning my head was quite the strenuous task. If I had gazed at it any longer, then I might have completely forgotten the fact that I was still imprisoned.</p><p>“They had died because they ended up serving a bad lord after all.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>The thing which I gazed at instead of the nirvana was a Demon Lord’s feverless face.</p><p>Sitri, the Demon Lord of the Mountain Faction who was much superior to me in terms of position as she was ranked 12th, was staring blankly at me. Her eyes were telling me that she wished for nothing more than to be able to twist the neck of the cocky male who was sitting before her. She was so fearsome that I almost involuntarily apologized to her. I am serious. If she had glared at me a bit more seriously, then I might have even forgotten the fact that she had once tried to poison me to death.</p><p>······It is always another person’s rage that drags someone who is trying to slightly prolong their stay in nirvana back to reality.</p><p>I slowly opened my mouth.</p><p>“I am aware as to why Your Honor of all people has come here after having been assigned the duty as a judge. Yes, I know. Her Excellency Barbatos and Her Highness Paimon are most likely currently at their busiest.

As long as the Plains Faction and the Mountain Faction are now allied, there is a need for the vestiges of my imprisonment to quickly&nbsp;be&nbsp;erased.

No, shall I be a bit more honest?”</p><p>I chuckled slightly.</p><p>“This is not the only time it has been like this, the Crescent Alliance has always been in the state of being on the edge. Instead of being sacred, the Crescent Alliance has been barbaric, and instead of being blood allies through the meaning of shedding blood and tears while fighting together in order to face a common enemy, it is blood allies through the meaning of making your own allies shed some blood.”</p><p>“You.”</p><p>“Am I being too crude? Have I gone too far? I apologize. Nevertheless, Your Excellency Sitri, it is already a Crescent Alliance where 7 traitors were brought to light. From the start, half of the Demon Lords did not even participate in the Crescent Alliance. They have positioned themselves way back in the rear and the sole thing they are praying for is our failure. This one is asking this out of pure curiosity, but is now the right time to be heavily discussing sanctity and celestialness?”</p><p>The Demon Lord Allied Forces as of late have become weaker than ever. Demon Lord Belial died after having his face peeled off by Elizabeth, the Imperial Princess. Several Demon Lords whom I have never met before have either died in battle or were chased out of their castles. Adding to that, although there being traitors was a given, it turned out to be 7 Demon Lords.</p><p>The sacrifice was immense. The human alliance before us was in good condition. The area behind our backs was swarming with traitors, no, traitors to our kind. On that list of traitors to our kind, there was even the Rank 1st Demon Lord, Baal. Special countermeasures were necessary.</p><p>“We must group together more firmly than ever before. Until we have tortured the swines that are living idly in the backline, the plains and the mountain ranges are a single world. We must make haste and withdraw to the inner parts of the mountains, but there is no operation more difficult than withdrawing while already being torn to tatters. Even if the two parties have wronged each other, they must forgive one another. Only then can trust finally be established.”</p><p>“So? What are you trying to tell me?”</p><p>“It is simple, Your Highness.”</p><p>I spoke.</p><p>“If you had made an attempt at a whimsical ally’s life by poisoning them, then what I am trying to say is that you must start off by lowering your head and giving an apology. How could you be discussing this one’s sins with such a brazen look on your royal&nbsp;countenance?”</p><p>Sitri shut her mouth.</p><p>A long period of time passed before she opened her smooth lips.</p><p>“I do?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“To you, Skinnybones?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I’m the Demon Lord of the 12th rank and second-in-command of the Mountain Faction. I have exclusive possession of Big Sis Paimon’s affection.”</p><p>“I am aware.”</p><p>I know that you are fanatical about Paimon.</p><p>“You’re nothing more than rank 71st, and not only have you made a half-breed your fiancée, but you made a human your acting general. If I were to punish you the usual way, then you would have died twice over. You want me to apologize despite that?”</p><p>“Apologize despite that.”</p><p>I spoke.</p><p>“Similar to the time in the past when Her Highness Paimon wept as she apologized in the council chamber of Niflheim despite being the head of the greatest faction in the demon continent.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“Or is Your Excellency’s head heavier than Her Highness Paimon’s?”</p><p>The silence continued.</p><p>Blood flowed on the ground where the torch was illuminating. The neck of the beheaded corpse was completely gone as if it had simply been deleted, making it appear as if it were never there to begin with. As the blood flowed and soaked Sitri’s feet, it went by the way of her toes&nbsp;and flowed between the bars before pushing its way to where I was seated and pooled underneath me. I was asking her if she was prepared to stand in the same pool of blood as me.</p><p>“Skinnybones.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“You look quite smart so you should know already by now. I don’t particularly think what I did to you was bad. I don’t feel sorry either.”</p><p>“I am aware.”</p><p>“The Mountain Faction and the Plains Faction will most likely have to start cooperating from now on. At that time, you’ll become quite important. You’re Barbatos’ sex friend and someone Big Sis Paimon reveres after all. Regardless, my instincts are telling me something. Skinnybones, you, no matter where or how I look at you, you’re nothing more than a&nbsp;<strong>slaughterer</strong><strong>&nbsp;who’s simply</strong>&nbsp;<strong>mad for authority</strong>. It’s to the point that I don’t want to know why Big Sis Paimon regards you highly.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>My word. A slaughterer?</p><p>I laughed. I did so louder than earlier. It wasn’t just me. The witches around me had started to giggle as well. Although we all had different throats, the laughter that came out from them easily mixed together. When the laughter blended together, the shadows shone by the torches also danced promiscuously. Sitri was vacantly staring at the sight of us having intercourse with our voices and shadows.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“This is, well. Ehem. That is quite. Dear me. It is rather difficult to assure you that I am not that sort of personage. O Your Respectable Honor. I had heard from the rumors that you are an individual who is interested in nothing but martial arts, but it appears you have outstanding observation skills as well.”</p><p>“Yup. I know a lot of the things that you don’t know.”</p><p>Sitri spoke.</p><p>“Even if I apologize to you, I can’t do it sincerely. No, I won’t apologize sincerely. Ever. Do you want to receive my apology despite that?”</p><p>“Pardon? I apologize, but I have absolutely no interest in Your Excellency’s sincerity. Did Your Excellency perhaps think that if you apologized sincerely that I would sincerely forgive you? Oh dear.”</p><p>The witches laughed.</p><p>“Your Excellency. Please think about it cordially. If Your Highness sincerely apologizes to this one, then would this one not have to also sincerely forgive Your Highness? How troublesome is that? I am already suffering due to the threats on my life, but do I now have to even pretend to be sincere? If we warmly apologize and forgive one another, then would the world become beautiful? That beautiful world would be for Your Highness, but would it be for me?”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“That is not the type of apology which I am requesting. I am ashamed to say this, but I do not have even the slightest intention to sincerely forgive Your Highness. Whether there is sincerity in the apology or not, that does not change the fact that Your Highness had made an attempt at my life.”</p><p>“Then?”</p><p>“Get on your knees.”</p><p>Kneel.</p><p>“Lower your head.”</p><p>Bow.</p><p>“Utter the words of apology. Endure the ridicule and bear with the indignity. Accept defeat as defeat. Promise me that Your Highness will no longer attack me for a preposterous reason ever again.”</p><p>Apologize, endure, bear, accept, and promise.</p><p>“And in return.”</p><p>In return⎯⎯⎯.</p><p>“Despite being aware of the fact that Your Highness is not being sincere, I will forgive Your Highness.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>I will forgive you.</p><p>You who had casually tried to kill me.</p><p>“I shall believe Your Highness’ promise. Of course, my wariness will not disappear, but why would that matter? Promises are bound to last long if they are bound together with sound suspicion rather than groundless trust.”</p><p>Traditionally, this much must be done in order for one to utter ‘Ah, I did well winning’ and beautifully bask in the victory.</p><p>How humiliating it is when you have to apologize no matter what even though you do not mean it.</p><p>Furthermore, how delightful it is to watch the humiliation of a failure.</p><p>As that is what apologies essentially are, it had to be like that. It was only appropriate for the one who is being forgiven to be disgraced and the one who is doing the forgiving to be jovial.</p><p>Regardless of whether they knew that or not, the witches held their sides with laughter after hearing my words.</p><p>“Yup, Master is······ Master really is, yup······.”</p><p>“Crazy”</p><p>“Insane.”</p><p>“Mental.”</p><p>“Overall, he’s our master.”</p><p>“He’s crazy and crazy that he’s crazy for three generations and thirty-three generations.”</p><p>“How lovely. How adorable. How pretty. With what confidence is His Greater Being so cute? It feels like even if he licks, covets, rams, or violates, he’ll be declared innocent if he goes to trial. Yup. I was perfectly logical just now.”</p><p>“You’re a perverted bitch who’s logical.”</p><p>“I acknowledge the verdict.”</p><p>“But it can’t be helped since he’s a eunuch.”</p><p>“Yeah, since he’s a eunuch with single-minded devotion to his attendant, Miss Lazuli.”</p><p>“⎯⎯⎯Finally finiiiiiiiiiiished!”</p><p>“Butt?”</p><p>“You bitch?”</p><p>“Damn it, I can’t win with shiritori. They’re crazy bitches after all.”</p><p><em>(TL note: Shiritori is a game where you say a word that begins with the final letter in the word that was said previously. So here it was 완서어어어<strong>엉</strong>-&gt;<strong>엉</strong>덩<strong>이</strong>-&gt;<strong>이</strong>년이)</em></p><p>“In any case, that was a surprise.”</p><p>“What have you been scribbling on that parchment since earlier? Do you even know how important the conversation we’re having right now is? For you to be doing something else even though we’re discussing something this important, I can’t believe it.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“I was composing a song? I had just now finished writing a masterpiece of the century? I had finished my preparation of making everyone piss themseeelves? Is there a problem? In any case, how important of a conversation was it that you’re acting like that?”</p><p>“I don’t know. What were we in the middle of talking about?”</p><p>“We were talking about our master being insane.”</p><p>“We were talking about our master being a eunuch.”</p><p>“Haa? What’s so new about the fact that our master is insane and also a eunuch that you girls are not only babbling about it as if it were important, but also as if it were a situation that could be corrected or changed? More importantly, everyone, I have finally finished the masterpiece that will prove my knowledge of art. Ahaha. If you listen to this and aren’t moved, then not only does that mean you are&nbsp;all&nbsp;lacking in culture, but it may also possibly prove that you all lack a brain. In that regard, you all must&nbsp;naturally&nbsp;listen to my song and be moved. Since no one has ever proved the existence of your brains until now, today, on this day, I shall prove the fact that a brain does indeed exist in your skulls⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Once that was said, the witches went quiet.</p><p>It wasn’t a witch who had said no. It was Sitri.</p><p>Sitri stared straight at me and said it again.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“As I thought, I can’t apologize to you. I can’t. Before quibbling over whether I can or not, yup, I don’t want to. I don’t want to apologize and I don’t want to express my remorse. Why should I?”</p><p>Sitri tilted her head slightly and smiled. Her grinning face looked so pure that it felt as if she were innocent since birth.</p><p>“Really, why should I? Accept defeat as defeat? Heeh. Skinnybones, you were only locked up for about a week, but have you already gone insane? I have never lost to you, Skinnybones.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“Yeah. I tried to assassinate you. Big Sis&nbsp;Paimon has an unusual interest in you for some reason. But it’s because of that very reason that I had tried to kill you. Me, big sis’ close aide. In any case, even if she has some interest in you⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>Sitri tilted her head a bit more.</p><p>“In the end, the one who is precious to big sis isn’t you but me. If the moment where big sis has to choose either you or me arrives, then she’ll choose me, not you.”</p><p>Surely.</p><p>She was not a bastard who lived without thinking nor was she a bitch who lived without thinking.</p><p>“Ah, you over there.”</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Before the short exchange could even&nbsp;fully&nbsp;happen, Sitri swung her blade and slashed one of the witches’ shoulders. Blood erupted. A cry erupted.</p><p>Srrrrck.</p><p>The blade part of Sitri’s weapon shrank down all on its own. It was a blade that could freely contract and extend. In my life before this, before I was brought to this world, I had seen that blade through my computer monitor.</p><p>The Connecting Blade. Rank 12th, Demon Lord Sitri’s favorite sword.</p><p>Sitri beamed at the witch.</p><p>“Hehe. You shouldn’t do that. You shouldn’t record this. What? Did you plan to record everything and hand the recording over to Big Sis Paimon, like you did before?”</p><p>Thud.</p><p>Sitri approached the collapsed witch. The witch was flailing about on the ground and continuously groaning in pain. Sitri put her hand inside the witch’s clothes, and shortly after, she pulled out an artifact that resembled a pocket watch.</p><p>“Uh, huuk······! Kuh, eh······,&nbsp;······uu, huuh······.”</p><p>“Reeaally, for you to use something like memoria magic without permission. You can’t do that. Dantalian, your witches have really bad habits. Is it perhaps because they weren’t educated properly when they were young?”</p><p>A blue flame burned. It happened within Sitri’s palm. Once the pocket watch was engulfed in the flame, it burned easily. Without even leaving behind a metallic stain, the artifact had crumbled into small particles of ash and floated into the night sky.</p><p>“I won’t kill her. It seems my subordinates were rude during a previous occasion after all. Okay. Can we call it even by saying that, by not having killed this witch just now, I had apologized for what I had done previously?”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“Skinnybones?”</p><p>This woman.</p><p>Is declaring war against me.</p><p>“Are you truly sorry?”</p><p>The torches shined and revealed half of Sitri’s body. Once the torches became shrouded, half of Sitri’s body was buried in darkness. I am uncertain as to whether she was like that since birth or not, the color of Sitri’s hair half resembled fire and half resembled water. Her eyes were also captured half in light and half in darkness. My current appearance is most likely reflecting like that to Sitri as well. I assumed that.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>While assuming,</p><p>— It will not be easy.</p><p>I looked back at the conversation that I once had with Lapis in the past. It was back during the time when I thought that I&nbsp;would have to assassinate Paimon if need be. On that night where we had held a ballot on the Crescent Alliance expedition and led it to its approval, Lapis called Paimon ‘that person’ and warned me.</p><p>— Sitri is always by that person’s side.</p><p>— Sitri?</p><p>—&nbsp;The Rank 12th Demon Lord. If one were to rank them by personal strength, then Rank 2nd Agares is at the highest, Rank 8th Barbatos is second, and after that is Sitri at third. Since she follows that person like an elder sister and does not leave their side for even a moment, it will be difficult for an assassin to get through.</p><p>Is that so.</p><p>Is she a rabid dog that is always beaming like an idiot but bares her teeth solely for Paimon?</p><p>My instincts were noisily raising an alarm in my head. I thought while putting away the alarm.&nbsp;······As the head of the Mountain Faction, Paimon led the greatest faction in the demon continent for no less than 400 years. She raised the demon continent on the outside, while, in the background, she secretly established the Republic of Batavia at some out-of-the-way shoreline on the continent ruled by the humans. People have to use their own brain a fair amount even when just trying to maintain two households, but how extremely difficult must it be for a monarch to manage two nations? I am speaking from the heart, but while Demon Lord Paimon’s popularity was virtuous, she had somewhat insufficient resources.</p><p>······A&nbsp;<strong>different person</strong>&nbsp;filled that lack of resources and assisted her. Paimon did not inform me that she had some other chancellor like that. The fact that she did not tell me despite it being something that did not need to be hidden, meant that even Paimon did not know she had a chancellor like that.</p><p>I carefully examined the woman before me.</p><p>It was this bastard.</p><p>It was this person, this person whom I didn’t know whether to call them this bastard or this bitch, that was secretly assisting Paimon.</p><p>Similar to how I indulged in disguising myself as a crazed debauchee by making Lapis my lover and pretended to be the world’s stupidest man by making Farnese my acting general.</p><p>This fellow, Demon Lord Sitri, voluntarily became a hermaphrodite and habitually committed all sorts of perverted eccentricities.</p><p>“······Hmm?”</p><p>In order to plant a prejudice against herself into the people&nbsp;whom she meets and make them disregard her.</p><p>“Ehehe. Don’t glare at me like that so much, Skinnybones. I said I was sorry, all right? I apologized saying that I was sorry. Honestly, you plotted together with Barbatos and started this war, right? You did all sorts of terrible things! A lot of it!”</p><p>The Mountain Faction’s shade.</p><p>If Paimon was simply a woman who was trying to spread out the sunlight, then this rabid dog in front of me was a girl who only acted in the shade.</p><p>“At the lowest, the number of soldiers who had died because of you is in the thousands. Wow, just saying thousands is really······ on the other hand, I just simply tried to poison you alone. And yet, I’m saying sorry to you right now. I feel really conscientious. You’ll forgive me, right?”</p><p>I answered.</p><p>“······I shall forgive you.”</p><p>“Yup, good. We’ve reconciled now, all right?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Nonsense.</p><p>“Good. You forgave and I was forgiven. One person was hurt and one person was killed. Although it feels slightly unfavorable for me, well, since Skinnybones is the rather inexperienced protege, I have no other choice but to overlook it as your senior. Hehe. Then let’s continue the trial.”</p><p>Sitri took out the piece of parchment that had my sentencing written on it. While she was clearing her throat and getting ready to read, the witches were patching up their injured comrade. Sitri soon began to speak.</p><p>“Sinner Dantalian, listen.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“A few days ago, you had basked in the glory of being selected as the representative to give the speech of the Crescent Alliance to announce the start of war······ ah, I’m going to read from the beginning, okay? What am I supposed to do when I forgot where I had left off because some cheeky bitches interrupted me? That’s okay, right, Skinnyhead whom some cheeky bitches call master?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>I vow. I shall make you kneel down to me.</p><p>“Okay.&nbsp;······You, however, had dared to nominate the lowly blood of a human and, as a result, you had disgraced your blood allies. Although you are the representative of all of demonkind, since the one you had chosen to act in your place was a human, at the very least, you have thrown away your obligations, and at most, you have sullied the customs of demonkind. Your sin is tremendous.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I shall make you bow.</p><p>“Sinner Dantalian, heed my words once more. The court has closely inspected your past, therefore, it has become clear that you had only committed your crime due to your own foolishness and not because you had borne any ill will towards the Crescent Alliance. Although you may have made a dirty member of humankind into your acting general, the person in question has massacred a countless number of her own kind.”</p><p>I shall make you apologize.</p><p>“The way of the world asks you whose blood has been passed down to you. However, the customs of the battlefield ask you who you had shed your blood for. Thus, even if the blood one was born with is different in the Crescent Alliance, we are blood allies because that blood flows towards the same place. As your humble-blooded subordinate,&nbsp;after having inherited the blood of that lowly race,&nbsp;has served us by adding another vein to our blood allies, is that not also praiseworthy?”</p><p>You will have to endure indignity.</p><p>“The people of the past once said that dispensing justice and achieving victory cannot be one and the same. However, the council has judged that this is a battlefield. How could one possibly differentiate justice and victory as separate entities in a battlefield? Achieving victory in a war is always as valuable as justice. That is the custom of the battlefield. It would only be appropriate if the broadness of the nature of your crime is counterbalanced by the steepness of your meritorious service in war. That too is the law of the battlefield.”</p><p>You will also have to bear with the humiliation.</p><p>“When one must first consider the urgency of the battlefield before the way of the world, that is called mercy. If one must rely on mercy while granting amnesty to a sinner, that is solely done in the hopes that the criminal possesses loyalty. Even if your sins are pardoned, from this point forth, you must be cautious as to not disgrace this mercy and betray our faith.”</p><p>You will be unable to endure before you are able to endure at last, and you will have to cope with something that cannot be coped with.</p><p>“You must continue to achieve victory and be the one to prove righteousness. You must bear in mind the reason why we are granting you mercy and why we have boundless faith in you.”</p><p>Because you will fail irreparably.</p><p>“As the defendant has committed their crime in the battlefield, they deserve to be judged according to the customs of the battlefield. Dantalian, as the commanders leading the Crescent Alliance, we, Barbatos of Immortality and Paimon of Benevolence, have hereby made their verdict and it shall be conveyed to you through this Sitri of Devotion.”</p><p>Look forward to it, Sitri. I promise you.</p><p>“⎯⎯⎯You are declared not guilty.”</p><p>I shall teach you what an apology is.</p><p>······Creak.</p><p>Sitri opened the iron door of the prison with a key. The witches approached and wiped my body with the towels they had prepared beforehand. Every nook and cranny. As the girls clothed me in my garments, I stayed silent as they cleaned and clothed me like that. Once I was fully in my attire, I put the straw which I had lived together with for the past week behind me and stepped forward.</p><p>It was night.</p><p>Because the spring rain had left after having disposed of a lot of water, the world was glimmering with moisture during the night. As what was connecting this side with that side was first darkness and moisture second, it was the torches trembling due to the moisture that came third. Breathing lives and dead lives were emitting steam in the area beyond the shaking torchlight, and Farnese was performing above everything as if she were dancing. On this night where the season solely spread a foul stench, I was discharged.</p><p>Sitri grinned.</p><p>“Congrats on being discharged.”</p><p>I bowed.</p><p>“Your grace is immeasurable.”</p><p>“Yup. You should know that it’s immeasurable. You go overboard because you don’t know your limit, so if you want to suppress that, you have to be aware of the fact that there is a boundless net spread out above your head. Don’t try to tear it. It won’t tear. It’s a net that has been casted over the history of the Crescent Alliance for 500 years. Don’t raise your head too much. You’ll get caught if you do.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>Sitri was pleasantly talking in an affectionate tone. She was smiling in a way that wasn’t excessive or lacking. Similar to how a farmer has no need to swing their plow excessively while cultivating, or how a fisherman has no need to use less strength while gathering, Sitri was not excessive or lacking when pressing her foot down on the thing that was trying to oppose her. It felt as if to Sitri, this was as natural as farmwork was for a farmer.</p><p>“Yes, Your Excellency. I will bear that in mind.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Ehehe.”</p><p>It was at that moment. Sitri reached her hand out and pulled me by my necktie. While forcefully raising my head which I had meekly lowered, Sitri brought her face close to my own. Right in front of my nose. It was a friable distance where I could feel the opposition’s breath around the rim of my eyes.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-97303\" src=\"https://images2-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&amp;gadget=a&amp;no_expand=1&amp;resize_h=0&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fshalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com%2f2017%2f10%2feb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-61.jpg%3fw%3d700\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" srcset=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-61.jpg?w=700 700w, https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-61.jpg?w=103 103w, https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-61.jpg?w=205 205w, https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-61.jpg?w=768 768w, https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-61.jpg 820w\" alt=\"던전 디펜스 - Volume 5 - Page 61\" data-attachment-id=\"97303\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2017/10/17/dungeon-defense-volume-5-chapter-1/%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-5-page-61/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-61.jpg?w=700\" data-orig-size=\"820,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"던전 디펜스 – Volume 5 – Page 61\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-61.jpg?w=700?w=205\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-61.jpg?w=700?w=700\"></p><p>Sitri quietly whispered in the general area of my eyes.</p><p>“⎯⎯⎯If you act up again, then I’ll make you bite the dust without a single trace, all right, Skinnybones?”</p><p>And I, believed that I could vividly see the halves of flames burning in her pupils.</p><h4>▯King’s Beloved Slave, Berbere Witch Sisters, Captain of the Royal Guard, Humbaba</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 10</p><p>Polles, Bruno Plains, Army of the Crescent Alliance</p><p>Sheesh, hey. Sheesh. I thought I was going to kick the bucket.</p><p>As I thought, the aura of high-ranking Demon Lords is something else. Seriously, their aura.</p><p>Despite my looks, you know? As I lived my life, you know? I’m a girl who’s experienced every fucking thing that can be described as fucked and what happened just a second ago was really fucked. I believed that the O Goddess of All had personally created this single enunciation and presented it to us lowly people exactly for situations like this.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>Master Dantalian was still deep in thought. Even though a fair amount of time had already passed since Sitri had left and it was nearing midnight. If our master goes quiet then we also have to be quiet.</p><p>Lord and vassal of one mind. As his loyal subjects, we can’t possibly dare to interrupt our master’s thinking.</p><p>“How difficult. It is abstruse. We must withdraw to the demon continent as soon as possible, but when there is someone&nbsp;among our allies who is still trying to interfere······.”</p><p>That was the only thing our master had muttered, and, without saying anything else, he continued to think in silence. He was definitely plotting an immensely profound scheme that the likes of us couldn’t possibly imagine since the contents of our brains were lacking. Yup. I know. I am well aware.</p><p>The problem iiisss, this is damn&nbsp;boooring.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>A dark night.</p><p>Only the torches which the guards had set up and abandoned were leisurely burning to nothing. Tic, tic, the sound of sparks flying······.</p><div></div><p>I could see the lips of my dear fellow witches twitching and wriggling, making it obvious that they wanted to utter nonsense, overflow with bullshit, and make the world vastly tremble both high and low. Aah, fatigue is a scaaary thing. It has a side that is more terrifying than torture. Torture and fatigue even have sides that are parallel to some extent.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The fact they have no end.</p><p>The fact they have no bounds.</p><p>Ah, truly, the fact that they have no end or bounds.</p><p>It’s okay. I’m, confident in enduring torture. That’s why I’m so good at even playing with boredom.</p><p>I reminisce the past whenever this happens. Me, you know, despite how I look, you know, I’ve experienced a lot of fucked up things as I lived. Since there is no end or bounds when it comes to fuckery, it’s the perfect thing to dwell on when bored.</p><p>If there’s only mud no matter where you place your foot and if there’s only muddy water no matter where you shove your mouth, then that means that people have no other choice but to live after having thrown away a certain amount of their lives somewhere······there was a senior witch who had once said this while smiling sweetly.</p><p>That senior had said that and was burned to death in a plaza.</p><p>If we’re lowly beings no matter where we go and if we’re lowly beings no matter where we head, then let’s just become the lowest of beasts and gather all of the gold in the world······there was a witch who was the same age as me that had said this while cackling.</p><p>That witch had said that and died after having all of her limbs torn off in a marke</p>"

Dantalian, I believe that this proverb roughly translates to this.”</p><p>Barbatos spoke.</p><p>“When you’re screwed, you must quickly realize the fact that you’re screwed.”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“That is correct. What is important is how fast you realize this. However, the issue is, Your Excellency Barbatos, is that in order to know whether you are currently screwed or not, you must have had the experience of it beforehand. If one has not already experienced being screwed, then they will either end up being incapable of realizing that they are in a screwed situation, or even if they do realize it, they will realize a step too late. Therefore, in order to know thyself, you must experience being screwed many times.”</p><p>“Hm. If you consider the fact that I’ve experienced an incredible amount of screwed up situations in my life, I can’t really disagree with you there.”</p><p>Barbatos nodded.</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>“Yes, Your Excellency. In conclusion, the term ‘Know thyself’ roughly translates to ‘Be screwed as many times as possible’. However, what is the reason we are trying to listen to proverbs in the first place? Is it not precisely because we do not wish to be screwed? Not only is the proverb ‘Know thyself’ meaningless, but it also destroys the&nbsp;meaning of existence for proverbs themselves. You could also say that it is the most worthless proverb in the world.”</p><p>“Dantalian. You’re reasonably good at sex and your face isn’t that bad either, so you have a lot of talents, but among your many many talents, the talent you’re best at is your technique to disguise bullshit so it doesn’t sound like bullshit. Even if the most nonsensical bullshit in the world were to flow through your tongue, it would sound like rubbish that is somewhat&nbsp;worth&nbsp;listening to, or it might even sound like trash that is really worth listening to. I, Barbatos, Rank 8th Demon Lord and the lord who boasts immortality, acknowledges this fact. Your smooth talking is easily on the level of being extraordinary.”</p><p>“I am honored, Your Excellency.”</p><p>Paimon, who was quietly listening to our conversation from the side, appeared as if her mind was blanking out. She then muttered.</p><p>“······What exactly are you two currently discussing?”</p><p>We both turned to look at Paimon.</p><p>“Nothing, whore.”</p><p>“Nothing, Your Highness.”</p><p>We then turned back to each other and continued.</p><p>“If you think about it, proverbs aren’t particularly useful. Proverbs are, in other words, pieces of advice that were made to be useful to as many people as possible, right? Then that means tons of people already know about these proverbs, and in the end, proverbs provide us with pieces of advice that you, I, and everyone else already know, so there’s no actual need for these pieces of advice in the first place.”</p><p>“Your words are reasonable beyond measure, Your Excellency.”</p><p>“Let’s say that I had said that the last thing which you can trust the most is money. If you simply listen to this line, then you’ll probably think that this is a somewhat obvious fact. However, if I were to splendidly write ‘<strong>The last thing man can trust the most is money’</strong>&nbsp;and engrave this line into a pillar of a temple, then not only would this strangely sound like it wasn’t obvious, but because it feels obvious at a glance, it’ll instead appear as if it didn’t sound obvious at all. I, Barbatos, Rank 8th Demon Lord and the most distinguished lord in the demon continent, present this opinion. Are proverbs not all like this?”</p><p>“Surely. As expected of Your Excellency Barbatos. A wisdom that befits the lord who boasts immortality and is also the most distinguished Demon lord. Lowly foot soldiers would have no other choice but to stand in awe at Your Excellency’s insight. Let me try testing it out as well.&nbsp;<strong>You cannot win a war with tired soldiers, more so with hungry soldiers.”</strong></p><p><strong>“The enemy of my enemy is my ally.”</strong></p><p><strong>“If you think that you are an idiot, then you actually are an idiot.”</strong></p><p><strong>“Play. You will have fun.”</strong></p><p><strong>“Live. If you really want to live.”</strong></p><p>Paimon looked at us with a face that appeared blanker than earlier.</p><p>“This lady has no idea what the two of you have been doing since earlier······.”</p><p><strong>“Paimon is a whore.”</strong></p><p>“This damn bitch······?”</p><p>Paimon struck Barbatos’ left cheek. Barbatos kicked Paimon’s right shin. Paimon struck Barbatos once more. Barbatos kicked Paimon once more. The space was then infinite.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>10 minutes flowed by.</p><p>It was a meaningful 10 minutes.</p><p>“In any case, we have to know the fact that we’re screwed.”</p><p>Barbatos spoke while massaging her left cheek with some ice.</p><p>“That’s all I wanted to say. That we’re screwed. That old and bald-headed Marbas may be mad, but he’s firmly upset right now.”</p><p>“That is your problem, Barbatos. The fact that you talk&nbsp;needlessly&nbsp;crudely.”</p><p>Paimon wrapped a bandage around her right shin.</p><p>“Truly. Do you know how inefficient you are when speaking to people? Every time you utter a word, it becomes a waste of time.”</p><p>“Like how you waste your life every time you utter a word, bitch?”</p><p>“See? Again with your crude manner of speaking······. When this lady was going out with you in the past, this lady believed that it was because you were still young, that your way of speech had become aggressive&nbsp;because you had gone through a lot of perilous experiences at a young age.&nbsp;Thus, this lady thought that,&nbsp;with great magnanimity, she should be understanding of your behavior. However, seeing as there was no change despite 500 years having passed, it was not your experiences that were the problem, but simply your personality itself that was the issue. Your tongue is unnecessarily promiscuous.”</p><p>“Heeh. Like how your crotch is unnecessarily promiscuous?”</p><p>Paimon slapped Barbatos’ right cheek. Barbatos kicked Paimon’s left shin. Paimon slapped Barbatos once more. Barbatos kicked Paimon once more. Time was then eternal.</p><p>15 minutes flowed by.</p><p>It was a beautiful 15 minutes.</p><p>“Old man Marbas sent a letter a short while ago.”</p><p>Barbatos spoke while rubbing her right cheek with some ice.</p><p>“Should I even call it a letter? Plain and simple, it’s an ultimatum.”</p><p>“Marbas has always been a bit hard-headed.”</p><p>Paimon wrapped a bandage around her left shin.</p><p>“Although the things which he thinks are allowed do not always have to be allowed, the things which he has determined to be not allowed are unallowed no matter what. In good terms, he is a principlist.”</p><p>“In better terms, he’s a damn&nbsp;aggressive old fossil.”</p><p>Paimon nodded.</p><p>“And he is a bald old man.”</p><p>Barbatos nodded.</p><p>“And he’s a bald old man.”</p><p>Was that last comment absolutely necessary?</p><p>While internally giving all of the bald people in the world my deepest sympathy, I spoke.</p><p>“What was written in the ultimatum?”</p><p>“Seeing is believing.”</p><p>After unnecessarily uttering that line in a cool fashion, Barbatos tossed me the piece of parchment that was rolled up into a scroll. On the piece of parchment, a&nbsp;rage-filled handwriting was grandly strewn about it.</p><p>······I have set up camp in the fields and mountains a fair distance away from the battlefield. When you two had sent me to these fields and mountains, we had discussed a stratagem to strike at the enemy supply lines in order to create breathing room for our kind. However, looking at things now, you two had cast me away in order to strangle our kind.</p><p>The military order I was given was to smite the enemies. Now that you two have killed our comrades, I shall ask the two of you who my enemies are.</p><p>You two, who had unbecomingly argued when discussing the subject of conquering the human armies, became harmonized when slaughtering our own troops. Did you two start this war in order to behead our own kind? I ask you two this, is it the territory of the humans which you two desire or is it the territory of the demons?</p><p>Saying that my faction has the most cavalry, you two are the ones who had assigned my troops as the detached force. I now intend to gather this large number of cavalry units together and direct them towards the two of you. Do I have a reason why I should not do so?</p><p>Striking you two from behind and straightening the laws of the demon continent is an easy task. However, as we have fought together on the same battlefields for the past several hundred years, I have sent you two this final letter in order to tell you.</p><p>Be ashamed of yourselves. Wear the clothes of criminals and crawl your way to these fields and mountains and await your judgment. Answer everything which I have asked. If you two await your judgment and answer my questions, then I shall decide whether to behead you two or not······.</p><p>“I see. I understand now.”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“So this is why Your Excellency had mentioned the saying ‘know thyself’.”</p><p>“This is why you said that when you’re screwed, you have to realize the fact that you’re screwed.”</p><p>“Since we have grasped the situation, let us immediately discuss countermeasures. How does Your Excellency plan to resolve this? I recall that before carrying out the purge, Your Excellency had said that you would handle His Excellency Marbas.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p><strong>“Even if you believe that things will work out, not everything will be resolved—.”</strong></p><p>“Although I do want to continue listening to Your Excellency impersonate the voice of some middle-aged old man since it is interesting, the situation is a bit too dire for it to be ignored by simply saying a proverb.”</p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p>Barbatos stuck out her lips and nodded.</p><p>“I don’t understand. How did he hear about the purge&nbsp;already? According to my calculations, no matter how fast the news got to him, we should have still had another quarter of a day left before he found out. This means that someone had secretly sent him a letter and told him about it.”</p><p>“A secret letter, huh······.”</p><p>For an instant, Demon Lord Sitri came to mind. The only reason for this was because I had clashed with her only a short while ago before coming here.</p><p>It was just after midnight.</p><p>Barbatos and Paimon were seated in chairs that were prepared for them outside. Even now, the subordinates of the traitors were being dragged in front of us before then being executed. From time to time, when the executioners turned to glance at Barbatos and Paimon with a ‘Should we really kill them’ look on their faces, the two Demon Lords would nod lightly. Barbatos and Paimon had nodded their heads several times&nbsp;already since a short while ago, and each time they did, the heads of the subordinates would be sent flying.</p><p>One of the subordinates had a frantic look on his face as he stretched his arm out towards us.</p><p>“Y-Your Highness! O Greater Being! This one, this one had met Your Highness when he was little! In Niflheim! When Your Highness was carrying out a triumphal celebration⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>“Yeah, a confidential letter. If one of us didn’t hand over the information beforehand, then there’s no way that old man Marbas could have reacted this soon.”</p><p>Barbatos nodded.</p><p>There was a death throe and then there was the sound of something falling and rolling on the ground.</p><p>I stroked my chin.</p><p>“Does Your Excellency have an assumption on who it was?”</p><p>“I have noooo idea. In the first place, didn’t we do this purge in order to get rid of those types of bastards? How is it that the instant we wipe them out, there’s already another bastard present to sell us out? Is it perhaps that? Do the other Demon Lords have a hobby of selling people out whenever they’re bored? Is betraying your comrades trending right now?”</p><p><strong>“Comrades refers to enemies who have yet to betray you.”</strong></p><p>“Ah. That sounds somewhat like an actual proverb. It’s a bit fucked though.”</p><p>Haaa, Barbatos let out a sigh.</p><p>“Forget it, fuck. Let’s just forget everything. Those human bastards are swarming at the front and those traitors to our kind are flocking at the rear. Furthermore, among those who you think are your comrades-in-arms, there are insects who hastily write secret messages. Makes me wonder why I’m making myself go through this much hardship by going to war······.”</p><p>“This lady had told you so back when we were going out. That you should not behave impetuously with everything. You must broaden your mind a bit, Barbatos. The problem is that your mind is unnecessarily stiff.”</p><p>“And your problem is that your crotch is unnecessarily loose. Your crotch is so broad that even if all of heaven and earth went in there, it feels like there’d still be enough space for the universe. The foul stench which flows throughout the world every time you spread your legs can probably make those already dead corpses come back to life before twisting their limbs and dying once more.”</p><p>“Aha.”</p><p>Paimon smiled.</p><p>“In other words, you mean those corpses that had died because of the convulsions which had occurred due to having intercourse with your incredibly stiff crotch? This lady heard that the numbers reach approximately seven thousand. They say that the God Hades sends his regards to your crotch annually in order to show his respect, but have you considered visiting the underworld in order to express your gratitude to him? Right this instant, if you must.”</p><p>“This whore?”</p><p>“What are you going to do about it, you barren girl?”</p><p>“Why is it that there’s never a time where our opinions match? Since our opinions are the complete opposite no matter what the topic is, whenever we talk, it feels as if there’s a demon continent inside of us that’s split in half.”</p><p>“This lady has to reveal that she too feels the same way. That is why it feels as if the demon continent could live in unity if you were to disappear. However, this lady does not wish to go out of her way to dirty her hands&nbsp;so it would be wonderful if you went to some location unseeable to this lady and died on your own.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“What’s worse is that our opinions differ even here. I want to just kill you with my own two hands after all. Even if you commit suicide, I’ll be happy if you do so after getting hit by me a bit first, and if you commit suicide before I can even hit you, then I’ll feel so cheated that I’ll just hit your corpse.”</p><p>“Boor.”</p><p>“Hypocrite.”</p><p>“Murderer.”</p><p>“Sex maniac.”</p><p>“Most rotten thing in the world.”</p><p>“And you’re the biggest bitch in the world.”</p><p>“Y-Your Hiiiiiiighnessss!”</p><p>And then another obscure nobody shouted.</p><p>“This humble servant has an old mother and a young daughter waiting for him back home, so this servant cannot possibly die yet. Please show mercy and⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>“Do you truly wish to live like that? Barbatos?”</p><p>Paimon nodded.</p><p>There was a death throe, and then there was the sound of something rolling.</p><p>A marvelous staccato.</p><p>“Can you not live a life that is a bit better? This lady is referring to a more beautiful life. An elegant way of speaking. If you do so, then even your irremediable personality will become slightly beautiful.”</p><p>“I wonder. I’m not sure if I’m living like this because I want to live like this, but the fact that I don’t want to live like you, bitch, is clear. Rather than how I want to live my life, not wanting to live like someone else is the staple of leading my life. Especially when I look at you, the thought ‘let’s not live like this bitch’ is so strong that, in that regard, you’re the bitch who’s continuously extending my life and, in that regard&nbsp;only, are you a bitch that’s of any use.”</p><p>“The fact that your life is like trash is not surprising at all.”</p><p>“Yoour Hiiiiighnessss!”</p><p>Barbatos and Paimon nodded at the same time.</p><p>“So how should we deal with this?”</p><p>“So how should we respond to this?”</p><p>There was a death throe, and then the obvious sound of something rolling followed after.</p><p>A beautiful harmony.</p><p>“Marbas has military insight. He is experienced. If he becomes our enemy, then it would become troublesome for us in no small measure. Normally, we would resolve the situation through dialogue⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>“He’s firmly pissed off right now. More than anything else, we don’t have a lot of time. The news about our purge will soon hit the entire region of the demon continent hard and the Demon Lords in the back will hastily try to gather troops. We have to cross the Black Mountains as fast as possible and return home before that can happen.”</p><p>Paimon nodded.</p><p>“We do not have enough time to persuade him.”</p><p>“And we don’t have the leisure to fight and win against him even more.”</p><p>“Although there is the possibility that he will forgive us if this lady and Barbatos were to wear white mourning garments and prostrate ourselves before him⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>Barbatos nodded.</p><p>“We can’t. If we do that, then that would end up meaning that our purge was wrong. Why are we apologizing? Didn’t we just kill traitors? People who doubt us will start to appear and we’ll lose our justification. I don’t like that. We have to lead our punitive expedition through the demon continent with a fight of justifications anyway, but we’ll be at a disadvantage if we apologize.”</p><p>“Dantalian.”</p><p>“How are we going to deal with this problem?”</p><p>The two Demon Lords then gazed at me.</p><p>Me, the very person who had set this purge in motion.</p><p>“Of course, I’m not telling you to give us a solution right this instant.”</p><p>“However, we are pressed for time.”</p><p>If by a very slim chance the purge were to end in a failure, me, the one who would receive a blow more severe than anyone else.</p><p>With cold eyes.</p><p>“Midnight has passed. I’ll give you until&nbsp;<strong>midday today</strong>.”</p><p>“At the least, we will also have to devise a countermeasure before Marbas takes action, after all.”</p><p>“Until then, we’ll be handling the after-measures of the purge.”</p><p>“This lady apologizes. The time limit is excessively pressing.”</p><p>One of them was my sex partner,</p><p>and the other was my political partner.</p><p>The two were also figures of authority who&nbsp;both&nbsp;could purge 7 Demon Lords without any hesitation whatsoever at the same time.</p><p>As they were figures of authority that could blame someone without any hesitation if they had to blame someone, they could be cold when they had to be cold, and they were well aware of when to set themselves ablaze if they had to be hot. In other words, the lords of all of demonkind were obliquely staring at me.</p><p>“No matter how smart you are, I’m aware that this is a difficult request. But.”</p><p>“We must ask this of you, Dantalian. All of our fates are on the line.”</p><p>Therefore.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“······.”</p><p>Tap.</p><p>I pressed my thumb against my chin as if I were patting it.</p><p>⎯⎯⎯Slowly.</p><p>The scenery of the night flowed smoothly.</p><p>As if time had forgotten about its own speed.</p><p>Soldiers roamed around the encampment while holding torches. The military camp was illuminated by the torches located here and there, making it seem like summer fireflies were randomly flying about. Below each light, the subordinates of traitors had been caught and were being dragged. They were either dragged off and killed or dragged here and killed. A single group of soldiers snickered. A dark night. The snickering easily spread from the shadows. The underlings howled until their heads were severed, and in an instant, a death throe would resonate before coming to an abrupt halt.</p><p>Who is it?</p><p>Who is trying to bite me right now?</p><p>The purge had proceeded with extreme secrecy. If you did not have a high-ranking post like a Demon Lord, then you could not have found out about it. The traitors were all punished without exception, and yet, a letter had still reached Marbas. Although there were no traitors, there was a betrayal. Who was it? How?</p><p>Marbas had gathered his dispatched force and traveled a long distance away. Since he was constantly on the move, it was difficult to pinpoint his exact location. Despite that, the letter had properly gone straight to Marbas and⎯⎯⎯Marbas immediately believed the report of treason that was written in the letter. Why? Who was it?</p><p>How could he have trusted the report which stated that his comrades-in-arms of 500 years, Barbatos and Paimon, had caused a disaster without doubting the report even slightly? Is there someone he trusts more than Barabtos and Paimon? If there is, then who exactly is it? Who could possibly receive that much trust?</p><p>The last thing a person can trust the most is money.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>Tap.</p><p>I tapped my chin with my index finger.</p><p>Within the sensation and velocity of touching my skin, time became slower. I hastened my thought process.</p><p>Money. Military funds.</p><p>In the end, Barbatos, Paimon, and Marbas occupied the top government positions in their provinces. The financiers of the armies. Even this expedition of leading our troops for barely half a year had wasted a tremendous amount of supplies. However, these leaders had repeated expedition after expedition for more than 400 years. They should all be well aware of how important military funds are down to their cores.</p><p>You cannot win a war with tired soldiers, more so with hungry soldiers.</p><p>Thus there were a lot of firms throughout the demon continent. Groups of merchants that took full charge of the provisions and supplied them. Firms that loaned money to those who were lacking in military funds. There was a firm that was in charge of each respective Demon Lord, and in my case, it was the Keuncuska Firm. In the first place, the reason why Lapis Lazuli and I had met was due to that.</p><p>To merchants, war is an opportunity to make money.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>Tap.</p><p>I tapped my chin with my middle finger.</p><p>I searched through my memories. There was no doubt. There was a time and place where I had heard this. The information regarding which firm and merchant were in charge of Marbas. It was not because I had a particular interest in Marbas. It was a survival instinct. The firm and the merchant were coincidentally both quite important to me at that moment, and they were also in charge of ‘the person who was once severely hostile towards me’. Impressively, my survival instincts were forcing me to remember⎯⎯⎯.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>I then looked at the Demon Lord before me.</p><p>Paimon.</p><p>Rank 9th Demon Lord.</p><p>The woman who had accused me of the matter regarding the Black Death.</p><p>Once I looked at her, Paimon opened her mouth.</p><p>With a voice that sound three or four times slower than usual.</p><p>“······–······? Dan-tal-i-an?”</p><p>Paimon tilted her head ever so slowly.</p><p>I then remembered.</p><p>— Your Highness.</p><p>It was around the time I had met Lapis for the first time.</p><p>—&nbsp;If Your Highness does not repay the debt and interest or declare bankruptcy, then the Keuncuska Firm will have no other choice but to take Your Highness’ property and body by force.</p><p>The me at that time was in a completely different situation compared to now. I had no money. My life was hard-pressed. The urgency of my life had brought upon the criticality of time. I had to escape from my debt as soon as possible. In order to survive, I had hunted the game that was the easiest to tear apart.</p><p>— The Keuncuska Firm has a countless number of supporters. Amongst them, there are other Demon Lords like Your Highness.</p><p>— Rank 5th Demon Lord Marbas.</p><p>— And Rank 9th Demon Lord Paimon are also included.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>A dark night.</p><p>Soldiers were going back and forth throughout the camp while holding torches. Similar to how the light was lengthily connected from torchlight to torchlight, my thought process was connected from point to point.</p><p>Underlings let out their final cries of agony. Decapitated heads fell endlessly. Lapis Lazuli’s voice flowed between the endless screams and boundless cries.</p><p>— Our firm is famous for being merciless to debtors who fail to make their payments.</p><p>—&nbsp;In the past, there was an incident where Rank ······ Demon Lord Glasyalabolas received a loan of ······Libra and did not pay back the interest for ······.</p><p>Screams. Cries. Noise.</p><p>But not yet.</p><p>Similar to a steel sword that had rusted due to the passage of time, my memories were scratched in various places. Since a long time ago, I have always been weak at memorizing numbers and doing calculations. Those parts of my memories were always the first to be worn down.</p><p>However, as a steel sword was still a steel sword even when rusted, it was sharp enough to kill a person and save my own life.</p><p>Think.</p><p>Remember it.</p><p>There are still words left for Lapis, for my memories, to tell me. What was said? What did Lapis tell me?</p><p>It was a dark night. Because Lapis was standing in a place that could not be seen, the sensation of her opening her mouth and whispering&nbsp;silently&nbsp;flooded over me. Within the space where torchlights and torchlights connected and swayed, I solely connected the light within the light.</p><p>— Your Highness.</p><p>— At that time, our firm had hired a small number of 9,000 mercenaries.</p><p>— And left them in the command of Rank 12th Demon Lord Sitri.</p><p>— Glasyalabolas could not even hold out for ······ before surrendering.</p><p>Tap.</p><p>I tapped my chin with my ring finger.</p><p>The wind blew. The torches flared up.</p><p>As they flared, the light created a long line.</p><p>Who wishes for the war to not end? Merchants.</p><p>Who is trying to interfere with the war right now? Marbas.</p><p>Which firm is in charge of Marbas? The Keuncuska Firm.</p><p>All right.</p><p>If that is the case, then who rules over the Keuncuska Firm?</p><p>I asked myself this.</p><p>I immediately answered.</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok.</p><p>An ancient vampire who has lived for several hundred years,</p><p>and the merchant who held the most hostility towards me before anyone else.</p><p>Oho. Oh dear. Would you look at this?</p><p>I quietly gazed at the band of light that was surging in our military encampment. Barbatos and Paimon, while slowly drawing their brows together, no, they were still endlessly drawing their brows together slowly, stared at me as I did that.</p><p>As I thought, Barbatos, Paimon, you two are clever. However, I shall offer you two my deepest condolences. The two of you have wound up misunderstanding something at a decisive area.</p><p>It was not a Demon Lord who had sent Marbas that letter. Ivar Lodbrok. It was the vampire who was in charge of Marbas and also did not desire for the war to end who had sent it.</p><p>I cannot blame these two Demon Lords for this misconception. Barbatos and Paimon had sincerely kept the matter regarding the purge under strict confidentiality. Only their close aides knew about it. If the information was leaked, then it was undoubtedly another Demon Lord who had done it, these two had jumped to this conclusion as if it were an obvious fact. This was their mistake.</p><p>Even if the only people who knew about the purge beforehand were the other Demon Lords⎯⎯⎯there is no reason whatsoever that the person to have sent the letter to Marbas had to have been the Demon Lord themself.</p><p>Instead of personally informing Marbas about the secret, all the information leaker has to do is lightly toss the information to the merchant who Marbas trusts. Because.</p><p>The enemy of my enemy is my ally.</p><p>That’s right.</p><p>Rank 12th Demon Lord Sitri.</p><p>Paimon’s close aide. The person who had learned about the purge faster than anyone else.</p><p>Most importantly, the enemy who is hostile towards me and is trying to bring me down.</p><p>— Your Highness.</p><p>— At that time, our firm had hired a small number of 9,000 mercenaries.</p><p>— And left them in the command of Rank 12th Demon Lord Sitri.</p><p>I do not know exactly when, but it was definitely since a very long time ago.</p><p>A relation that was close enough for the Keuncuska Firm to hire an army and leave them in that person’s command. A rare relationship that was so close that the person would strike other Demon Lords for the Keuncuska Firm&nbsp;and make those Demon Lords cough up money.</p><p>Since a very long time ago⎯⎯⎯the Keuncuska Firm and Demon Lord Sitri were ‘accomplices’ with a cozy relationship.</p><p>After Sitri had passed on the information regarding the purge to Ivar Lodbrok, Ivar Lodbrok had sent the letter to Marbas.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“······.”</p><p>Tap</p><p>It was at the moment my pinky had tapped my chin.</p><p>The world finally released an anxious sigh. The light returned to the light. The many sounds returned to the throes of death. Time had recovered its beating pace and flowed quickly.</p><p>As expected, Barbatos and Paimon stopped slowly drawing their brows together and spoke to me.</p><p>“Dantalian? What’s up with you all of a sudden?”</p><p>“Are you perhaps unable to hear this lady’s words?”</p><p>No.</p><p>I hear you loud and clear. So clear that I cannot hear you any better than this.</p><p>I raised the corners of my lips and smiled.</p><p>“Your Excellency ordered this one to take care of this matter before midday, correct? It is all right. Do not worry. I have a rough grasp on how things have proceeded after all.”</p><p>Both Barbatos and Paimon tilted their heads in the opposite direction from each other.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>As expected of the two women who were each other’s first love, their thought processing speed was also similar. Even the angles which they had tilted their heads in were alike. In short, they were the exact same degree of slowness.</p><p>Albeit, despite this fact, their thought processing speed was on the fast side. Is this not regrettable? The original speed is bound to be relative.</p><p>I spoke once more while matching their pace.</p><p>“Your Excellency Barbatos. Your Highness Paimon. This one has a general grasp of the situation. There is no need to wait until midday today. I shall take care of it within an hour, so please handle the preparations to withdraw with haste.”</p><p>“······Whaat? No, wait. Wait a second.&nbsp;······What? You grasped the situation? What are you talking about? Don’t tell me, are you saying that you figured out who it was that leaked the information?”</p><p>I knit my brows slightly.</p><p>“That is the case, Your Excellency. I have said that with that exact meaning in mind. What other meaning could it possibly have? Have I ever ridiculed Your Highness with nonsense before?”</p><p>Barbatos shut her mouth.</p><p>Paimon spoke up from beside her.</p><p>“······How exactly? We have yet to carry out any sort of investigation. There are over 10 Demon Lords who could have possibly leaked the information. How could you have figured out who it was without having interrogated anyone?”</p><p>“My apologies, Your Highness Paimon, but investigations are actions that are carried out when one lacks information. Although this one may not know a lot of things, this one at least knows enough to figure out what must be known.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence.</p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p>“All right. When this one was born, this one was born possessing reasonable intellect. This one can easily figure out things which Your Excellency and Your Highness still do not know. As this is simply a fact, please accept it as so. For what reason is it that this one, who is at the tail end of ranks among Demon Lords, is able to have a private audience with lords and monarchs such as Your Excellency and Your Highness? Is it not because my noggin was appraised highly? It is nothing new. Please accept the fact that my brain has more creases than Your Excellency and Your Highness’ and let us first discuss countermeasures.”</p><p>“······That’s right. I completely forgot because I shoved you in a cell for the past week. Dantalian, although you’re reasonably good at sex and have a reasonably good-looking face, more than anything else, you’re a fucking annoying bastard.”</p><p>Barbatos sighed heavily.</p><p>“The Heavens are quite disturbingly fair. Even though they gave this bastard a good head and tongue, they forgot to package him with the most important thing, a good personality. Hey, you black lamb, if you were a bit more modest, then we would probably have had sex a hundred more times every time we did it.”</p><p>No.</p><p>I don’t need that kind of bonus. Seriously.</p><p>The ‘play’ which you forced me to do was so extreme that I honestly got freaked out every time we did it. Master or whatever. Telling me to treat you like a slave or whatever. It felt like she had a few loose screws in her head. I apologize, but even someone like me, who&nbsp;has both common sense and refinement, finds this to be difficult to endure.</p><p>“······So who is the culprit?”</p><p>It seems Paimon had regained her composure as she covered her mouth with her fan.</p><p>“No, rather than that, what did you mean when you told us to handle the preparations to withdraw with haste? Please explain it to us in a more calm and orderly manner.”</p><p>“I apologize, but I cannot tell Your Excellency or Your Highness about the culprit yet. Just know that this one promises to handle this issue perfectly.”</p><p>“Ah. Again. Look at this bastard roll his tongue again. Fuck, it wasn’t just once or twice that that had gotten the best of me.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Barbatos scowled.</p><p>“How do you plan to deal with it? Are you telling us to simply believe in you with no questions asked? And what do you mean by withdrawing already? Do you not see us still dealing with those remaining pieces of garbage over there? Just those guys alone number in the thousands. The thousands. It’ll take the entire day just to wipe them all out.”</p><p>“That is what I wished to talk about, Your Excellency.”</p><p>I grinned.</p><p>“Do we really have to go out of our way to&nbsp;cumbersomely&nbsp;kill them all?”</p><p>“······?”</p><p>“Your Excellency and Your Highness. Please allow me to borrow your ears for a moment.”</p><p>Barbatos and Paimon looked straight at each other’s face.</p><p>They then, as I had expected, leaned their ears towards me at the same angle and speed.</p><p>I smiled benignantly as if I were presenting enlightenment to a couple of people who were lost in a cloud of thick dust.</p><p>Shortly after.</p><p>“⎯⎯⎯Crazy bastard. Insane bastard. Fucking bastard. No, seriously, when did you make something like that? You’re crazy, right? You’re insane, right? Fuck. How could you do that without my permission?!”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>Barbatos struck my cheek as if she intended to chew me alive right this instant. Paimon was simply gazing at me with a ‘woooow······ wow, woooow······’ expression on her face. Even though the directional nature of the two was the complete opposite, what they actually wanted to express was the same.</p><p>The fact that I was a crazy bastard.</p><p>“No! Absolutely not! Are you insane, you son of a bitch? Do you think I’d just sit here and allow that?! Get rid of it right this instant. No, hand it over. Hand it over to me!”</p><p>“Dantalian, this lady also believes that that is a bit too much······. No, of course, this is a fact that this lady was already aware of, but for your information, the only ones in the world who know of this fact are you, Dantalian, and this lady······. Barbatos had killed the rest.”</p><p>“And I’m going to kill you now!”</p><p>Barbatos grabbed me by the collar and shook me intensely.</p><p>Mm.</p><p>A man like myself was a man that had found that reconciling two Demon Lords who were once lifetime enemies was not enough and had the caring heart to even bring their personal opinions together in perfect harmony, but before I could be in awe with my own greatness, mm. I felt nauseous. I felt like I’d really throw up if she continued to shake me any more than this. My gastric fluid was shouting that they wanted to see the outside world as well.</p><p>I spoke calmly.</p><p>“Nevertheless, even if you say that. The method which this one had informed Your Excellency and Your Highness about is the most effective.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>Barbatos froze in place.</p><p>Thanks to that, my urge to vomit was able to subside. I displayed a fresh smile. Every time I smiled like this, Lapis Lazuli would advise me in a serious tone, ‘······Your Highness, since that smile easily calls upon one’s desire to commit murder when witnessed, please refrain from doing so as much as possible’, but how could that possibly be the case? Since a long time ago, Lapis’ aesthetic sense was somewhat lacking in certain parts. When I smiled refreshingly, I knew how to actually smile refreshingly.</p><p>“Is that not so?”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“Most importantly, there is no political burden whatsoever. What could people possibly say on the outside after having witnessed it? Could they even go around to places telling people about it? There are no losses and only a lot of merits. Even if Your Excellency requests me to suggest a stratagem that is more splendid than this, it would only trouble this one······.”</p><p>Barbatos frowned.</p><p>“······Shut up. Damn it. Since you’re the one talking, this bullshit doesn’t sound like bullshit.”</p><p>“Of course, that is because this is not bullshit. Your Excellency, accepting the truth as the truth is also the virtue of a sovereign.”</p><p>“I told you to shut your damn mouth!”</p><p>Barbatos let go of my clothes and groaned. She had started to contemplate while pulling at her hair, but it felt as if she was quite Bhuddistically exploring who I roughly was, where I had come from, and where I was going.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>Thinking.</p><p>“······Uuuuuu······.”</p><p>Anguish.</p><p>“Fuck······.”</p><p>And resignation.</p><p>“Do what you want, you son of a bitch······.”</p><p>After magnificently accomplishing the three steps of Buddhism, Barbatos gave herself up in despair. Although, regrettably, it felt like she was unable to accomplish the actual last step which was enlightenment. It was fine. I did not severely rebuke the lack of virtue of all creatures. Despite my appearance, I am quite merciful.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I spoke with a mindset that accepted all of the unsightly things of the world.</p><p>“A most accurate decision, Your Excellency. This one is always in awe when hearing Your Excellency’s voice. Although Your Excellency occasionally makes very bad decisions such as when Your Excellency had threatened me and even thrown me in prison, that is no more than occasionally, so I can confidently say that Your Excellency makes the correct decision the majority of times.”</p><p>“······Dantalian is, what should I say?”</p><p>Paimon muttered from behind her fan.</p><p>“His head is good, but he is slightly, or perhaps an incredibly unfortunate man······.”</p><p>This was quite the heated criticism.</p><p>“In any case, this one will take it as having received Your Excellency and Your Highness’ approval beforehand, so this one will be taking his leave······ Ah, right. Your Highness Paimon.”</p><p>As I was lowering my head and about to depart, there was something that I had suddenly remembered, so I whispered to Paimon. As Barbatos was still asking herself what the root of her existence was, she did not show any concern to us.</p><p>“Was it perhaps Your Highness who had spread those booklets throughout the military headquarters of the Crusaders?”</p><p>“Pardon?”</p><p>Paimon tilted her head prettily.</p><p>“Booklets······ is it?”</p><p>“Yes. Books that have gray covers. They are incredibly thin.”</p><p>“Mm? This lady does not know. This lady is not sure of such things.”</p><p>Paimon hid the sides of her mouth with her fan and knit her brows. Her expression appeared as if she were trying to think of something, but was unable to recall anything at all.</p><p>“What exactly are those booklets supposed to be that you are asking this lady about them, Dantalian?”</p><p>“Please do not be surprised. I heard that the humans in the army of the Crusaders had written down my speech on their own initiative and are reading it as they pass it around. That is the booklet which I had mentioned.”</p><p>“Oh dear, is that true? It has been a long time since this lady has heard such good news.”</p><p>Paimon was visibly delighted.</p><p>“As expected, people will understand if spoken to. If they do not understand even if they are told, then the majority of the time, it is because their education is incomplete. Their lack of education is due to the unworthiness of the monarch&nbsp;so the subjects cannot be held responsible. When one’s subject does not understand, it is only appropriate for the monarch to lament instead of rage. In that regard, the fact that the humans are passing the booklets around on their own volition······ that is truly, truly a joyous event.”</p><p>Paimon spoke with a complexion that was dyed with elation.</p><p>“Is there something which this lady could help with?”</p><p>Surely.</p><p>Is that how it is.</p><p>I courteously held my smile in my mouth.</p><p>“Is the sight of the people trying to stand up on their own not beautiful? Would it also not be beautiful to silently watch over the people trying to stand up on their own? If they are no longer able to endure and end up reaching their hands out, it would not be too late to take hold of their hands at that time.”</p><p>“Fufu.”</p><p>Paimon muffled her laugh. Beyond her fan, her voice was dyed in endless joy. It was a smile that was gentle because it was beautiful.</p><p>“Indeed, that is right as well. Your words are correct, Dantalian. This lady will hope that the lovely scenery will be prolonged for as long as possible.”</p><p>Perhaps, Sitri was moving behind the scenes solely for this smile.</p><p>Right when we were about to say our goodbyes while smiling at one another, Barbatos glared at us with murderous eyes like a chihuahua that had starved for roughly two days.</p><p>“Hey. Do you not see me suffering here? What are you two so warmly whispering about?”</p><p>We both turned to look at Barbatos.</p><p>“Nothing, you washboard child.”</p><p>“Nothing, O Lord who has realized the virtue of destitution.”</p><p>Barbatos lamented.</p><p>“Damn bastards······.”</p><p>I’m saying it again, but this was quite the heated criticism.</p><h4>▯King’s Mistress, Mixed Blood, Lapis Lazuli Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day&nbsp;11 Polles, Bruno Plains, Army of the Crescent Alliance</h4><p>“······Has His Highness Dantalian not arrived yet? Why has he yet to come despite having called for me?”</p><p>“His Highness will be back soon.”</p><p>I spoke smoothly.</p><p>“Please wait calmly, Chief.”</p><p>“Do you know how many times I have heard that line now? After a while, in a short bit, soon······ tsk.”</p><p>We were in a tent that was shrouded in the night.</p><p>The Chief of the Keuncuska Firm, Ivar Lodbrok, clicked his tongue. He has been tapping his cane against the floor since a while ago. It is rather unpleasant.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Chief, this one had requested you to wait.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“If it is difficult for you to wait, then this one will&nbsp;separately&nbsp;notify you when His Highness has returned. Do you wish for this one to see you out?”</p><p>Chief Lodbrok glared fiercely in my direction. Did my words hit a nerve, I wonder. That is surprising. I was simply being considerate towards the old and infirm merchant.</p><p>“This youngster who is still wet behind the ears······. For someone who is simply the child of a common whore, with what courage are you babbling so proudly?”</p><p>“This one sees that you possess a marvelous talent, Chief. Yes. My biological mother was indeed a harlot. It has not been that long since this one had discovered this truth either. How did you find out, Chief?”</p><p>“Do you think that I would not have attached even a single spy on you? I am also aware that you were the one who had personally taken the head of your own mother. How interesting. Your behavior of imprecating others is a glory that you are able to bask in solely due to Demon Lord Dantalian.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“Do you not look forward to seeing if that glory of yours is simply a brief&nbsp;moment&nbsp;behind the scenes?”</p><p>That is so.</p><p>A foul stench is destined to emanate from things that have stagnated.</p><p>This is one of the horribly rotten truths of the world.</p><p>“Your words are harsh, Chief. Please be more mindful.”</p><p>“Ha.&nbsp;The day when Dantalian’s age of prosperity comes to an end will also be the day when your descent down to Hell begins.&nbsp;What would happen if the world were to find out that you had murdered your own biological mother? Since he has made such a boorish woman into his lover, His Highness Dantalian’s reputation will most likely plummet as well. Are you aware? There is not a single man in the world who would like a woman that could make them fall from grace.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>The Keuncuska was the leading firm of the demon continent.</p><p>As people would say, they were a group that was referred to as the Great Keuncuska.</p><p>Even now, the firm was carrying out the role of warehouse keeper and was providing supplies for the Crescent Alliance. Adding to that, Lodbrok was a big merchant who was in charge of both Demon Lord Marbas and Demon Lord Paimon. If you were not one of the higher ranking Demon Lords, then you would most likely be incapable of even standing against this vampire who was sitting in front of me.</p><p>“When that time comes, I shall observe how violently an outcast like you will behave against the world.”</p><p>I let out a sigh.</p><p>⎯⎯⎯I see that he is hardly worth my time.</p><p>My sigh must have irritated him as the chief drew his brows together.</p><p>“Who do you think you are to be sighing before me?”</p><p>“You should also be well aware since you said that you had placed spies on this one. Although it may be more than this one deserves, this one receives deep affection from His Highness Dantalian. This one will not deliberately point out the issue regarding the fact that you are speaking informally to the mistress who may or may not be capable of exerting her influence to His Highness.”</p><p>“Oho. That is quite the high horse you are on there. What are you trying to say?”</p><p>“In the end, this one will not make His Highness Dantalian fall.”</p><p>The chief snorted after hearing my words.</p><p>“And here I was, curious as to what it was that you wanted to say. What a foolish child. Is that something that will not happen simply because you wish for it to not happen? The mere act of spreading the news of your lowly and immoral crime would be enough to immediately drop the reputation of······.”</p><p>“I apologize for cutting you off in the middle of your sentence, Chief, but how exactly could that possibly make His Highness fall?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The chief knitted his brow. Was he unable to understand? Or is he feigning ignorance despite having understood?</p><p>Regardless of which side it was, there should be no problem with playing along with the scrawny disposition of an elderly man. He is a precious guest. I am a person who welcomes precious guests with my utmost devotion.</p><p>“His Highness is not an individual who cares about his reputation to the world. To be more precise, as His Highness is a person who exercises caution towards the increase of his own reputation, His Highness is an individual who will instead try to lower his own reputation by any means possible. By doing so, he is able to bewitch the many beasts that live in blindness.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“His Highness had risen to the ranks of millionaires within the shortest amount of time in history. His Highness was the fastest person to have ever broken through the Black and White Fortresses. When Demon Lord Marbas was defeated and Demon Lord Barbatos’ forces were in danger of being breached, it was also His Highness who had obtained the achievement of rescuing the Crescent Alliance. Despite these facts, how are things like, Chief?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I was simply speaking in a voice that was neither high or low.</p><p>“Despite these achievements, are the sounds of praise towards His Highness resonating throughout the demon continent?”</p><p>That was not the case.</p><p>His Highness’ fame was not even remotely high. Demon Lord Dantalian, who was ranked 71st, was so insignificant that he was a monarch whom the majority of the people living on the demon continent have never heard the name of. Although it felt as if his fame would begin to spread around the time the Black Death had started to spread, that was only for a moment. By making a half-breed such as myself into his fiancée and appointing a human girl as his acting general, His Highness’ reputation had fallen to rock bottom</p><p>A lecher. A fool among fools.</p><p>That was the standpoint which the majority of demonkind had towards His Highness.</p><p>“His Highness’ wealth is attributed under this one’s accomplishment as his head handmaiden. The meritorious deeds of breaching through the Black and White Fortresses and rescuing the Crescent Alliance are set as services carried out by Lady De Farnese. Chief, do you consider all of these things to be a coincidence?”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“You threatened to widely spread the news that this one had murdered her own mother, correct? That is fine. This one will not stop you. If anything, His Highness would most likely give you a round of applause and thank you, Chief. He will presumably say something along the lines of ‘You have done a good job doing this great one’s task in his stead’.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“In the end, there is no way that this one could ever make His Highness fall. Because His Highness has always desired to reside in the low shadows. His Highness is an individual who prefers to dwell in the shadows whenever the noon sun is shining in the sky. This one is graciously one of those shadows for His Highness.”</p><p>Acting General, a human child.</p><p>Captain of the Royal Guards, an immensely lowly witch.</p><p>Head Handmaiden, a half-breed succubus.</p><p>As vassals, we serve His Highness for life. His Highness is a fire that will burn the world. If the fire is going to burn and shine its light as far out as possible, then, more important than anything else, a night, a dark night was undoubtedly necessary. An illegitimate child, a slaughterer, and an outcast, we are His Highness’ dire night.</p><p>“The likes of us are nothing but humble beings, but we attend to His Highness with our humbleness. As we know that this is our duty as his vassals, we have no reason to change our despicableness.”</p><p>The vampire became silent.</p><p>The cane that kept tapping against the floor of the tent had stopped as well. Even the occasional noise of him clicking his tongue had ceased. This is a good disposition. This most likely means that he has sufficiently understood my words. I nodded my head towards the chief one more time before turning around and resuming the task which I was taking care of.</p><p>Night.</p><p>A lot of things cannot be seen at night. You can only make assumptions of the places which you cannot see by using the sounds that can be heard, and in the distance, the creaking sound of wheels was echoing over the tents. Creak······. Grains of soil broke apart underneath the wheels and the sound of a person’s voice overlapped it.</p><p>— Cheap services. Will throw away, dead beggars for you. Will throw away, dead corpses lying in the corner for you. Will pick up any kind of corpses. Cheap services. Will throw away, all dead beggars······.</p><p>It was a homeless person wandering around the military encampment.</p><p>When the sun rises, these beggars gather together and gamble in a place where there is less sunlight, and when the sun sets, they search for tents with bright torches and stick out their bowls. Although the beggars who had lost even their bowls in gambling would stick out both of their hands, the beggars who had even lost their fingers in gambling would stick out their three or four fingers.</p><p>I can confidently assert that having less than three fingers on a single hand is not exactly pleasant news to a beggar. As that means they cannot retaliate properly if someone were to kick them, even if they could retaliate, it means that their efforts would be insignificant. Moreover, who would not wish to kick a beggar? From time to time, when the common soldiers kick at the beggars, the ones who have less than three fingers are assaulted without being able to do anything to defend themselves and this occasionally results in their deaths. The deaths of those beggars is natural and trivial. Similar to how normal people use their fingers to count numbers, beggars use their fingers to count the remainder of their lives.</p><p>One at a time.</p><p>One at a time.</p><p>And then it ends at one.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Corpses are thrown away in the corner of tents and left to rot. Flies gather around those rotting corpses. The annoyed soldiers kick the corpses further into the corner, but the corpses simply continue to pile up in every corner. This provides another type of livelihood for the beggars.</p><p>Sturdy-shouldered beggars, whose fingers were still fine,&nbsp;roamed around the military camp while pulling cheap-looking carts that came from only God knows where. On a cycle of every couple of days, they would roam around and collect the corpses in the corners. They then took the corpses far away in order to throw them out. Is this not brilliant? As someone who was originally a&nbsp;merchant, I rate these sorts of things highly. Until the day they gamble away their carts, they had managed to obtain a job for even the shortest amount of time by themselves.</p><p>Whenever the beggars pass by this tent while dragging their carts,</p><p>— I wonder if it’s because that incredibly dreadful bitch lives here. Spit, there’s a damn ton of dead chaps and bitches······.</p><p>they always say something as they do so.</p><p>Even their method of begging was highbrow in quite the number of ways.</p><p>I simply tossed two coins outside the entrance of the tent. There was no need for me to go out of my way to step outside. The wheels would then momentarily stop in the vicinity of this tent’s entrance before letting out another ‘creak’ and departing.</p><p>Creak, creak.</p><p>Creak······.</p><p>“Why did you toss those coins to that person?”</p><p>A voice that sounded as if it were lost in thought.</p><p>Chief Lodbrok was glaring at me firmly.</p><p>“They would have taken care of those corpses even if you left them alone.”</p><p>“That would not be leaving them alone, but pushing them away. The people do not easily forget the ones who have pushed them away.”</p><p>I answered in a subdued tone.</p><p>“The ones who are not forgotten by the people can easily fall into ruin. If you can buy the apathy of the people with a couple of coins, then it is basically like having bought it for free. Although this one may be engaging in the business of a Demon Lord’s feudal government, there has yet to be a time where this one was unfaithful to the duty of a merchant.”</p><p>“Are you trying to buy the contempt of the people because you are a merchant? Is that an item which can be handled by merchants?”</p><p>“If it cannot be handled, then why would they be revering His Highness Dantalian?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>The candlelight flickered and dimly lit the interior of the tent.</p><p>Many things cannot be seen at night. In the places that cannot be seen, there are beggars who die while begging and beggars who live by begging. When a fellow beggar dies, there are also beggars who beg by doing the job of picking up corpses and throwing them away. In the world, each place that cannot be seen is a corner, each out-of-the-way corner is a gap, and each gap is a wall. It is possible to escape from the corner of the world by climbing up that wall, but I do not blame them for simply hanging off the edge of the cliff and spending their days shaking.</p><p>It is simply an occupation and merely a physiology.</p><p>I do not blame them, but I use them instead. Beggars, harlots, and mercenaries, these were all things that lived while placing their occupation in a crevice. Similar to how a beggar uses the corpses of beggars on a daily basis in order to live, I continue my profession while leaving the crevices of the world&nbsp;as crevices. The note that was being illuminated by the flickering candlelight was also a part of my job.</p><p>— Loud noises outside. Violently killed. The soldiers are going through the bordello. It is scary. A lot of fire is burning outside.</p><p>I wonder if they had written this in a hurry. The words on the memo that was sent by the spy were crooked. I checked the next letter.</p><p>— The soldiers suddenly shut up. It’s quiet now.</p><p>— Sudden inspection. All of the girls who had hidden the books were taken away. I survived because my lover had told me about it beforehand. I’m saying this because I’m lacking money this half of the month, but please send more. Would that be okay?</p><p>— My sisters are being dragged away. They still haven’t returned. I’m scared. I can’t do this any longer. Please do not contact me anymore after the next payment. I’m sorry. I won’t tell anyone.</p><p>These letters were all sent by harlots.</p><p>Whether to plant spies inside of the military tents or to plant spies in the vicinity of the military tents. Although these two options both have their own respective merits and demerits, I cannot help but prefer the latter. The lives that live while hanging off of a piece of rope that is dangling off the side of a cliff are the ones who will be the very first to realize when that rope begins to shake.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The only things which they can barely understand are signs and vague omens. The tasks of seizing the signals that are sent by them and interpreting their messages are solely my duty as His Highness’ head handmaiden.</p><p>It is fine. I am a modest peasant.</p><p>A peasant knows best about the livelihoods of other peasants.</p><p>— Increase my pay starting the next half of the month. I’ll snitch you out if you don’t.</p><p>The life which will be forfeited after snitching will undoubtedly be your life and not my own.

      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><h4><strong>Chapter 3 – Hell</strong></h4><p>“⎯⎯⎯Look here, Your Lordship.”</p><p>It happened late in the night.</p><p>We were making our way through a woodland path. Farnese, who had been&nbsp;marching as the spearhead of our troops, steered her warhorse towards my direction. She dismounted from her horse and pushed something out towards me. It was dark, so I could not see properly. Whatever she had in her hands looked similar to rubbish or gunk.</p><p>Once I examined it a bit more carefully, I realized that it was a kitten.</p><p>“Its life has been injured.”</p><p>To be exact, a dying kitten.</p><p>Half of the kitten, the other half of which having already declined into being a corpse, was also diving into the River Styx minute by minute. I wonder what sort of terrifying beast had gotten to this little critter. Despite it being late in the night, the sight of its internal organs oozing out from between the cracks of its injuries was being shown without any mosaics.</p><p>Speaking of no mosaics.</p><p>In this world, things such as adult videos, a modern convenience that is also referred to as porn, obviously did not exist.</p><p>According to the classification of sociology, a society where porn has yet to be invented was, at most, nothing more than a society that was on the border of being referred to as primitive. Despite my looks, I am also one of the Demon Lords who represent demonkind, so is this situation not woeful? This great one has the duty of enlightening these barbarians as quickly as possible.</p><p>I had immediately gone into action.</p><p>Among the many magic tools, there was an item that recorded the scenery&nbsp;before it. The high-priced commodity known as the Memoria Artifact was an item which had a bad past record&nbsp;with me as it had screwed me over on various occasions. I had utilized this. The price was disgustingly high, but who cares? The billions of perverts of the past, present, and future all combined were cheering me on, I was certain of this.</p><p>That was why I had filmed it. The several times where I had slept together with either Barbatos or Lapis. In secret, without having received any sort of prior agreement with them.</p><p>And.</p><p>‘What is this, Your Highness?’</p><p>The very first adult video in the world was discovered in less than half a month since it had been completed.</p><p>‘Calm down, Lapis. Compose yourself and listen to my explanation. Even you will end up praising this lofty invention.’</p><p>‘Interesting.’</p><p>Lapis nodded. Fortunately, there were no signs that showed that she was upset. As expected of my lover who boasted a coldness that lasted all year round.</p><p>I harbored hope. If it’s Lapis, then she would definitely appraise this item&nbsp;accurately&nbsp;for its political value.</p><p>‘However, before listening to Your Highness’ explanation, there is something this one wishes to talk about. Your Highness, this is a rather serious topic.’</p><p>‘All right. Ask me anything. Be it the influence this invention will have in the world from now on, or the impact it will have on the continent⎯⎯⎯.’</p><p>‘Give this one at least a single reason why she should not kill Your Highness right this instant.’</p><p>She was incredibly pissed off.</p><p>I completely ignored something like my honor or whatever and prostrated. Everything was my wrongdoing and crime. In particular, the fact that I did not receive her consent was most likely the worst part.</p><p>The artifact that contained Lapis was disposed of&nbsp;on the spot&nbsp;without debate. In the end, I had forever lost the opportunity to leave my name in the history books of mankind as the founder of adult videos······.</p><p>“Your Lordship.”</p><p>And then, Farnese called out to me who had become lost in thought about the lack of mosaics.</p><p>“Why are you suddenly staring out into empty space with eyes that appear as if they had given up on everything in the world? Has Your Lordship’s brain perhaps become vacant? Hurry up and heal this life.”</p><p>Heal?</p><p>The cat’s breathing was nearly at its end. At the soonest, within 30 seconds. At the latest, its life will most likely come to a complete halt in less than 3 minutes.</p><p>I had also just sent the witches out on a reconnaissance mission. Even if I were to call them back in order to make them heal this critter, there would not be enough time. As this was a fact which anyone could tell&nbsp;simply&nbsp;by looking at the kitten, Farnese surely was not unaware of this either. Despite that.</p><p>“This young lady wishes to save it.”</p><p>Farnese looked straight up at my face.</p><p>When we had entered the Crescent Alliance and carried out an opening ceremony for our newly enlisted soldiers, you were the one who had personally cut down the miserable pack of dogs which you had cherished and raised with care, so how could you be opening your heart to the death of a kitten which you have no connection with······I, did not ask her this.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Through war, you have taken the lives of others repeatedly. Just the number of common soldiers you have slaughtered already reaches the tens of thousands, so what is your intention behind now referring to a single kitten as a life and requesting me to save it······I, did not inquire this.</p><p>Even now, the kitten’s wound is causing it to languish and suffer eternally so, if anything, the kitten would be better off if you put it out of its misery with your own two hands. What do you think about carrying that small life, putting it in your memory, and holding a funeral for it within your mind······I, did not give her this piece of advice either.</p><p>I waited.</p><p>“Your Lordship?”</p><p>Farnese tilted her head.</p><p>“Your Lordship.”</p><p>Farnese expressionlessly looked down at the kitten held in her arms and then gazed up at my face, she then repeated this motion over and over again, until eventually, an entire minute had passed. The kitten had a small head. Before long, the faint breathing of the small creature stopped. Once the breathing stopped, Farnese’s gaze also got caught there and paused.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>I slowly got down from my horse. Since I had not given the soldiers a separate military command, they forked around the two of us and continued their march. Dirt continued to crumble underneath the feet of the soldiers.</p><p>I knelt down before Farnese’s feet.</p><p>I sat up straight.</p><p>I then lowered my head all the way to the ground.</p><p>“I am sorry.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“The reconnaissance mission was urgent. I had temporarily sent all of the witches out. It was my decision. I did not predict that something like this might occur.”</p><p>The soldiers passed by us and continued to advance. I could tell because of the footsteps that were shaking the dark ground around me.</p><p>Although the footsteps occasionally hesitated and tried to stop next to me at times, the footsteps had no other choice but to continue onward because of the marching of the comrades behind them. From time to time, instead of footsteps, the low sound of whispering could be heard as well. I left those alone and allowed them to pass by.</p><p>“Why.”</p><p>I heard Farnese’s voice after a very long pause.</p><p>“Why are you apologizing, Your Lordship?”</p><p>“Due to my decision, you were unable to save a life.”</p><p>“It is a coincidence. Is there responsibility in a place where there are no intentions? How can an apology be spoken in a place with no responsibility? Sending witches on a reconnaissance mission is an everyday occurrence in military affairs. On the other hand, trying to save the life of a small critter is not related to military affairs at all. As Your Lordship’s general, this young lady is a personage who carries out the military affairs of a general. Rather than Your Lordship, would it not be appropriate for Your Lordship to reprimand this young lady for being unfaithful to her military duties?”</p><p>“I would have admonished you if you had requested that of me as a general. However, did you not come to me merely as a child with hope?”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“Currently, the witches are unable to utilize their familiars too much. This is also an order that I had given to them the other day. Because they do not have enough familiars to use as scouts, the witches have to personally fly up into the night sky. I am sorry.”</p><p>I could vaguely hear the sound of a war song coming from the line further ahead of ours.</p><p>Uhu uhu······ like that, the soldiers attempted to alleviate their struggles from marching throughout the night by singing. Since our forces were making their way out of the woodland path, the singing easily mixed together with the sound of the wind that flowed through the forest. Woosh······ uhu rya······. The song which mixed together the sounds of the wind and forest sounded more like the disconsolate cries of a feathered creature or a wild beast than the sound of a person.</p><p>“Why does Your Lordship have to apologize?”</p><p>“Because I am your lord.”</p><p>Farnese spoke.</p><p>“And is it because Your Lordship considers this young lady to be your daughter?”</p><p>“And because I have taken you in as my adopted daughter.”</p><p>“This young lady understands.”</p><p>Farnese laid something down beside my head. It was the kitten’s dead body. The internal organs which the kitten could not completely let out while it was dying were finally all released once the kitten had died. Like so, because the distinction between the inside and the outside was gone, the kitten was now going to return to the soil.</p><p>“This young lady wishes to forgive Your Lordship.”</p><p>Farnese sat up straight with my head held in her hands. As she stretched her knees and stood up, she lifted up my body as well. Farnese stroked my cheek.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“So this young lady shall forgive you. Father.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>I was forgiven.</p><p>I gazed down at the life that had ended and spoke.</p><p>“Child, are you not going to create a grave and give it a burial?”</p><p>“What are you talking about, Your Lordship? What a weird thing to say.”</p><p>Farnese pointed towards the kitten’s dead body, the soil which the dead body was placed on.</p><p>“Did this young lady not bury it in this world just now?”</p><p>The child was smiling brightly.</p><p>I stayed silent for a moment while I stood before Farnese who now knew how to smile well.</p><p>When I looked around, the soldiers were marching.</p><p>Similar to a bunch of will-o’-the-wisps heading towards the afterlife, tens of thousands of soldiers were illuminating the night sky with the torches held in their hands. The radiant torches connected with one another and further intensified the illumination. The shadows shone by the torches easily hummed war songs.</p><p>It was a barbaric scene. Many of the goblins snickered while they moved their bodies around. Whenever the wolf people at the front of the formation raised their maws and howled, the wolf people behind them would follow suit, causing the military march to be lengthily connected by howls. The shadows danced and howled on the roadside.</p><p>Night Parade of One Hundred Demons. These words automatically came to my head.</p><p><em>(TL note: Night Parade of One Hundred Demons, also known as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyakki_Yagy%C5%8D\">Hyakki Yagyou</a>)</em></p><p>Farnese spoke.</p><p>“I see that demons have quite the amount of nocturnal habits since they are not growing weary during a night march.”</p><p>“Even if nocturnal habits are a part of their physiology, does that make a march any easier? They are most likely joyous because they are returning home. The soldiers who leave on an expedition always welcome the order to go home the most.”</p><p>“Surely. If that is the case, then that would mean that the soldiers without a home would be less joyous.”</p><p>“That is so. We have a long way to go. Let us go quickly.”</p><p>We remounted our horses and grabbed onto their reigns.</p><p>If one were to turn around, then you would no longer be able to see the outline of your home.</p><h4>▯Kinslayer, Imperial Princess of the Empire,&nbsp;Elizabeth von Habsburg</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day&nbsp;11</p><p>Polles, Bruno Plains, Army of the Crusaders</p><p>Our army led our soldiers and approached the enemy encampment. It was quiet. The enemy troops that should have come out to oppose us were nowhere to be seen, but instead, only a dreary atmosphere loomed over the camp.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>Since the nobles were strangers to this sort of bleakness,&nbsp;they did not utter a single word&nbsp;even as they scoured the enemy base while on horseback. Even though this was the very enemy base which they wanted to crush and destroy so much, now that they were actually here, there was nothing to crush or destroy. One of the nobles simply pointed at the lofty tower of human bones that was&nbsp;located in the center of the enemy camp once they noticed it.</p><p>“What exactly is that supposed to be? How bizarre.”</p><p>“That is a tower which the enemy general, Farnese, had collected and piled up.”</p><p>I answered. The enemy general was not considered as a noble since she had been sold as a slave and had murdered her own biological father. Perhaps she was not even considered as human.</p><p>“They all appear like skulls in my eyes.”</p><p>“Be grateful that your eye sockets are healthy. That is a tower made solely from the skulls of humans.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“I heard that the enemy general has a hobby of beheading humans, skinning their heads, and making them a part of her eternal collection if they are to her liking.”</p><p>We brought our horses close to the tower of skulls. The sky was low since the fog had yet to recede, so the tower was tearing into the center of the low sky.</p><p>The nobles murmured. Their voices were filled with fear.</p><p>“Was the enemy general not a youngster who was clearly either 17 or 18 years old?”</p><p>“A 17-year-old girl with beautiful blonde hair. With her charming beauty,&nbsp;she would have received a lot of adoration&nbsp;if she were to have gone to social circles.”</p><p>The nobles went silent.</p><p>“Is there a problem, noblemen?”</p><p>The ones who could not stay silent vomited at the feet of the tower of skulls.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-48713 aligncenter\" src=\"https://images2-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&amp;gadget=a&amp;no_expand=1&amp;resize_h=0&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fshalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com%2f2016%2f12%2f25x25.png%3fw%3d700\" alt=\"25x25\" data-attachment-id=\"48713\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2017/01/05/dungeon-defense-volume-4-chapter-1/25x25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=700\" data-orig-size=\"25,25\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"25×25\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=700?w=25\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=700?w=25\"></p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>In the place where the Demon Lords must have rested as recently as yesterday, the leading figures of the Crusaders held an emergency meeting.</p><p>— The enemy has evaporated.</p><p>With the current situation of the Crescent Alliance having abruptly retreated before them, this is what the nobles had declared. That they evaporated. Because the way the nobles played with their words was foolish, I slowly knitted my brows.</p><p>“The word you noblemen are using is unusual. The enemy forces did not disappear spontaneously after being here for a moment. They have led their troops towards the opposite end of the Bruno Plains. Therefore, it would be correct to refer to this as a retreat and not an evaporation.”</p><p>“Your Highness, regardless of whether you refer to this as a retreat or an evaporation, is this still not a peculiar occurrence?”</p><p>“Sir, since your breath still reeks of vomit, I suggest you go and wash your mouth out first. Once you have washed it out, do it once more. I am unsure as to whether you have always had a foul breath or not, but your breath is severely rancid at the moment. It is making me dizzy.”</p><p>“Pardon······?”</p><p>“Could it be that your wife has to smell this stench every morning? Your wife’s mornings must be quite blessed now that you are out on a distant battlefield. Since you are gifting&nbsp;happiness&nbsp;to your wife even while a long distance away, you are indeed worthy enough to be known as a model husband throughout all ages. Please give my regards to your wife.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>Shortly after, the noble returned.</p><p>The imperial family of the Habsburg Empire is no different to a rotten pile of garbage among piles of garbage as their basis is in incest and they have also made a side-branch in adultery, but there is a single good thing about being born there as the imperial princess, and that is the fact that I am able to freely berate aristocrats. I am not boasting, but I am an imperial family member that has a lot of expertise in berating nobles.</p><p>Once we had thoroughly investigated the enemy camp, the day had already become dark. Soldiers were illuminating the surroundings of the meeting room with their torches.</p><p>“······What should we do now?”</p><p>A noble from the Republic of Batavia opened his mouth.</p><p>“I was dispatched from my country after being given the order to defend the Bruno Plains at any cost. If the demons have given up on the plains and retreated, then regardless of any military merits, I have already performed my duty faithfully.”</p><p>“With all due respect, but that is the same for this major general as well.”</p><p>A young duke from the Empire of Francia continued.</p><p>“The royal command His Highness had given to this major general was to protect the humankind that resides beneath the plains. If the enemy has retreated, then would that not mean that they had run away to the other side of the Black Mountains? There is no humankind there that this major general has to protect. No, it would be troubling if there were······.”</p><p>The young duke let out a sigh as he shrugged his shoulder. The other nobles chuckled.</p><p>Hoh.</p><p>I raised the corners of my mouth.</p><p>“I have no idea what you noblemen are saying. The enemy forces have urgently retreated in the middle of the night. How large were their forces? Were they not lacking a little under a hundred thousand? An army of a hundred thousand had curled their tails between their legs and retreated, so how could they possibly be in good order?”</p><p>“······Nevertheless, Your Highness. Even if they are no longer in good order, their military strength is still a hundred thousand. If they take thirty thousand from that hundred thousand and attach those troops at their rear, then breaking through that would be an incredibly strenuous task.”</p><p>“Are you now trying to make me laugh to death? If someone else were to hear you, then they would most likely assume that our military strength is only twenty thousand and not a hundred thousand. Whether the enemy forces make thirty thousand troops defend their rear or situate fifty thousand troops at their rear, why would that matter? All we have to do is sweep their troops and overwhelm them in a single moment. I am asking you all this just in case, but noblemen.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“Are you perhaps afraid?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>I looked around.</p><p>All of the nobles avoided my gaze.</p><p>It was strange, so I rephrased my words.</p><p>“I asked you all. Are you noblemen trying to take it easy because you are afraid of Farnese, the enemy general?”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>Aha.</p><p>These noblemen were trembling.</p><p>It has only been a couple of days since&nbsp;our entire army of a hundred thousand had been toyed with by the seven thousand troops led by Farnese. Their memories of that day were still clotting their hearts with fear. These fellows who respectively claimed to be generals and boasted about being knights were quite the impressive sight.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“The other day, I had rescued you noblemen from a crisis. Since the crisis&nbsp;of that day was a crisis where your lives were on the line, you could say that I had saved your lives. The person who had saved you is now commanding you to pursue the enemy. Do you intend to disobey?”</p><p>One after the other, the nobles opened their mouths, but they soon shut them. They repeated this several times until eventually, they all began to speak indiscriminately.</p><p>— The favor which Your Highness, the Honorable Imperial Princess of Habsburg, had done for us is so deep that there is no true path of paying back our debts, however, Your Highness is not this major general’s king. If the order from this major general’s own country and Your Highness’ order were to go in the same direction, then this major general would more than gladly obey Your Highness’ commands, but in a situation like this······.</p><p>— Your Highness, and my fellow noblemen. I am ashamed to be the one to say this, but more than anything else, we must always consider the worst-case scenario. What will we do if this were all simply a stratagem to lure us into desperately pursuing after them······?”</p><p>— The general is right. If the enemies are not defending themselves with twenty or fifty thousand soldiers, but instead, they are protecting themselves with all one-hundred thousand of their troops, and by that, if we are not the ones in pursuit but are actually the ones being lured into an ambush······.</p><p>— This one apologizes to Your Highness, but······.</p><p>— We are honored, but······.</p><p>Words.</p><p>Underneath the place where you could clearly see up the tower of skulls, underneath the pitiable skulls that were dead and thus had no eyes in their eye sockets and no mouths in their mouth holes, the nobles continued to speak in a tone that sounded as if it did not matter what they talked about or what they looked at.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>I slowly shut my eyes. Once they were shut, the blood and guts that were spilled by the corpses during the purge yesterday approached me as a scent. Even though there were a lot of still living demons tied up in the enemy camp, the nobles before me were delighted since they were treating those demons as free exploits of war.</p><p>Do they intend to be satisfied with the trash given to us as a free share from the enemy army’s winnings?</p><p>Do they intend to behead the prisoners whom the enemy had left behind as a contribution and use them as exploits? If they split this up among the nations here, then each nation would be able to take several hundreds. If they hang up the hundreds of demon heads and return triumphantly to their own countries with them, then it would make for quite the pathetic pretext. Instead of trying to win as defeated dogs, these men were already desperately trying to not be defeated······.</p><p>Fools.</p><p>They were looking down on the people.</p><p>The soldiers you are returning to your countries with are no longer simple soldiers, but germs that have been infected by Dantalian’s poison.</p><p>Even if only one out of ten soldiers possessed the booklet with the speech written on it, that will spread to a hundred once they return to their homelands. That hundred will infect a thousand and it will run as rampant as the Black Death. Are the emperors and kings whom you all serve good and wise kings? We are currently in a turbulent period where revolts occur even when there are no epidemics, but do you believe that you can prevent those flames? With what courage are you trying to hold onto the flames which you are unable to block with even your bodies?</p><p>There is no other choice but to place an even bigger flame down.</p><p>I opened my eyes.</p><p>“You are&nbsp;all&nbsp;noisy. Stop babbling wantonly and give me a short answer. Those of you who will obey my military command and pursue the enemies, quietly raise your hands. The rest of you, shut up.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>The useless words naturally subsided.</p><p>While the majority of them kept their mouths shut, hands started to go up by ones and twos.</p><p>The General of the Kingdom of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Grand Master of the Kingdom of Teuton, and the mercenary captain who was working for the army of the Kingdom of Brittany, but was left in a vague situation as the queen had returned to her home country······.</p><p>Good. With these three people combined, we will just barely have a military strength of about thirty thousand. The three of them were all nations that had cavalry units, so it was perfect. They most likely raised their hands because they were confident in their ability of pursuit.</p><p>“I am the successor of the Habsburg Empire. I am not the successor of the family which you all respectively serve. Will you still heed my commands?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The General of the Kingdom of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth lowered his head.</p><p>“Since you have saved my life once, I shall devote my life to you once.”</p><p>The Grand Master of the Kingdom of Teuton put his helmet on.</p><p>“Our king had ordered us to put an end to as many demons as possible. As the major general, this is in spite of myself, but it appears that joining forces with Your Highness the Imperial Princess is the correct path to carry out our king’s royal command.”</p><p>The mercenary captain lowered his back slightly.</p><p>“Her Highness the Queen of Brittany had left without giving us the rest of our pay. I am only saying this because she is not present, but she is deplorable to a certain degree. If she were not present in this world entirely, then I would have said that she is really deplorable, but since she still resides in this life, I have to practice good manners. I heard that Your Highness the Imperial Princess provides generous compensations. If Your Highness the Imperial Princess pays the remaining half of our backed pay, then we will follow your orders.”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>“Not bad. Since a person who knows honor, a person who knows loyalty, and a person who knows money have gathered here, with just us alone, we can easily rival the strength of a single nation. I order you, noblemen, to pursue.”</p><p>I then turned to look at the dogs and hogs that did not raise their hands.</p><p>“You all can rest easy here. It seems that there is no reason for me to tell you all to know shame. As there are expectations one should have towards others and expectations one should not have towards others, would telling you all that you are barefaced not be a part of the latter?”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“Regardless, there is a trivial request which I would like to ask you all. Share with each of us one of your banners. I know. It is a difficult request to heed. I shall request something more difficult. Take out one thousand and five hundred of the captured prisoners over there and hand them over to me. If you believe that these are truly difficult requests, then consider these requests as the same value of the lives which I had saved and let us&nbsp;call it quits with these.”</p><p>The nobles slowly bowed their heads.</p><p>The Grand Master then asked.</p><p>“When shall we begin the pursuit?”</p><p>I looked across the plains. The night was falling upon us.</p><p>I ordered.</p><p>“Now.”</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st,&nbsp;Dantalian</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 12</p><p>Polles, Army of the Crescent Alliance</p><p>A battle of speed. From now on, it was a battle of speed.</p><p>In our perspective, the Demon Lords who lived an idle life north of the Black Mountains were traitors, and in their perspective, we were a rebel army. Who the traitors&nbsp;are&nbsp;and who the rebels&nbsp;are, this will most likely be determined by the victors of the war. This was obvious. In order to become victors, we had to cross the Black Mountains and return home as soon as possible.</p><p>I spoke.</p><p>“Do not be concerned about whether it is day or night and simply continue marching. The armies of the Plains and Mountain Factions withdrawing, in and of itself, is what is important. Do not allow the group of traitors to even call together their soldiers. It should be fine to rest momentarily once you have reached the Black Fortress.”</p><p>It was exactly for times like this that I had captured both the Black and White Fortresses.</p><p>The bridgehead that was the fastest path to advance into the continent was also the fastest pathway back to one’s mainland. I did not capture this strategic point in order to simply attack the enemy. It was in order to easily receive supplies and also be able to calmly counteract if the situation in the mainland were to ever become problematic. Going through all that arduous effort in order to take the head of Margrave von Rosenberg was worthwhile.</p><p>Barbatos spoke.</p><p>“I also agree that we should retreat quickly, but what are we going to do about our rear? Dantalian, as you had said, don’t the Crusaders have an imperial princess who was born between a monster and a beast that had incestual relations and interbred?”</p><p>“It is fine. I shall do what I can to block the pursuers.”</p><p>“Hooh? Do you think you can manage the pursuers all by yourself?”</p><p>“If I am to be more exact······. I am incredibly sorry, but among the people here, the only military service member who is capable of managing the Imperial Princess Elizabeth von Habsburg is my acting general. Your Excellency Barbatos. Your Highness Paimon. Asking the two of you to do this would be asking too much.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>Even if you glare at me with such dissatisfaction, it cannot be helped. Before it was a matter of ability, it was a matter of talent. The kid, Farnese, had a gift that was capable of grasping battles themselves as melodies. Similar to how there are people who are lunatics since the moment they are born, there are people who are born while possessing these sorts of talents.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“There is also another reason why I must be the one to manage the rear more than anyone else. In the first place, for what reason did Your Excellency Barbatos keep me alive? Is it not because Your Excellency had keenly felt from your previous defeat the fact that it would be difficult for Your Excellency to handle the Imperial Princess of the Empire all by yourself? Since Your Excellency has spared my life, I should be worth my keep.”</p><p>“You’re barefaced as well. Why are you the one saying that?”</p><p>Barbatos snorted.</p><p>“All right. Dantalian. There’s no reason for me to stop you if you’re going to volunteer to take the short stick. Go ahead and try to obstruct the Crusaders’ pursuit with the seven thousand troops you brought with you.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>Paimon was looking this way with a worried expression. Her eyes appeared as if they were asking ‘would it really be okay?’ as they also worried about my safety. I smiled slightly.</p><p>“This is for the sake of the demon continent. Do not worry, Your Highness.”</p><p>“Dantalian······.”</p><p>A somewhat moved expression appeared on Paimon’s face.</p><p>I could hear the sound of affection points going up in real-time. At this point, my image has most likely been glamorized in Paimon’s head as a schemer who uses any means necessary for the sake of the peace of the demon continent. The comical thing was the fact that she was not excessively far from the point.</p><p>“Ah—.”</p><p>While Paimon and I were both imagining separate goals, a languid voice came from the side. Once we turned our heads, there was Demon Lord Sitri standing there with her left hand raised.</p><p>“Big sis. About that, can I also go to the rear and block the pursuers? The most difficult job in this retreating battle is obstructing those pieces of garbage that are pursuing us, so I feel like it would be shameful if we left that all in the hands of our youngest protege.”</p><p>······Again she’s.</p><p>Paimon blinked.</p><p>“Oh dear. If you say that you are willing to do so, Sitri, then I would naturally feel reassured, but······. Is that all right? Sitri, you should be aware since you have also faced against the Imperial Princess. This will not be an easy task.”</p><p>“Ehehe. Well, I’m not exactly going to be stopping her by myself. I’ll be planning together with our protege here and the human girl. That’s okay, right, Skinnybones?”</p><p>Sitri looked this way and smiled gently. Her smile was as natural as the fragrance of dirt emitting from a country woman.</p><p>“Despite my looks, I’m confident in my fighting ability more than anything else. If we fight together, then I’ll definitely be of some help. Ah. Would I perhaps be a hindrance to you if I’m present?”</p><p>“That is not so.”</p><p>I bowed my head.</p><p>“If Miss Sitri provides this one with her assistance, then it would be like receiving a thousand troops and horses. This one welcomes Your Excellency with open arms.”</p><p>Since the Mountain Faction had sent a Demon Lord, the Plains Factions could not stay idle. Among her subordinates, Barbatos sent Rank 16th Demon Lord Zepar. The meeting was adjourned like that.</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-48713 aligncenter\" src=\"https://images2-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&amp;gadget=a&amp;no_expand=1&amp;resize_h=0&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fshalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com%2f2016%2f12%2f25x25.png%3fw%3d700\" alt=\"25x25\" data-attachment-id=\"48713\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2017/01/05/dungeon-defense-volume-4-chapter-1/25x25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=700\" data-orig-size=\"25,25\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"25×25\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=700?w=25\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=700?w=25\"></p><p>On my way out after the meeting was over.</p><p>Because we had marched throughout the entire day, it was already dark. After resting here momentarily, Barbatos and Paimon will resume their retreat. I gazed at the other side of the sky and imagined the hooves of the enemies that were approaching.</p><p>Was the Imperial Princess Elizabeth chasing after us without rest right now? How many troops did she have with her? We had purposely left the prisoners behind. How well did my dissolution tactic work, I wonder······.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>The pursuing forces will most likely have less than fifty thousand troops, but more than twenty thousand troops. The imperial army of Habsburg will obviously take part in the pursuit. The other nations I should be anxious about would probably be the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Teuton. Those two nations share their borders with the demon continent after all. No matter the circumstances, those two nations have no other choice but to be hostile towards us······.</p><p>If these three nations all participate in the pursuit, then their military strength will reach an astounding number of thirty thousand. This will not be easy. There was no reason for us to wipe out the pursuers. Holding on until Barbatos and Paimon safely cross the Black Mountains. A delaying tactic. That was enough······.</p><p>“Seems like you have a lot of thoughts running through your head in various ways, Skinnybones. Why is it that&nbsp;you have a lot on your mind whenever I see you?”</p><p>At some point, while I was heading back to my quarters while also in deep thought, Sitri was at my side. I put my thoughts aside and bowed respectfully.</p><p>“The Imperial Princess of Habsburg is a terrifying human. The pursuers will be precipitous and tenacious. There is a need for our side to also be fully prepared in order to fight back.”</p><p>“Mhm. You have to stubbornly declare that the Imperial Princess is a scary human after all. If you don’t, then no one will forgive someone like a human girl for going around acting like a general. Isn’t that right? The reasons why you should have a head attached to your neck would also decrease.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“You’re really hardworking, Skinnybones. I don’t get bored no matter how much I watch you. Yup. How should I say it? Do you not have that kind of experience? Those times when you absently stare at an ant&nbsp;wiggling around&nbsp;on the ground for no reason whatsoever. That kind of feeling—.”</p><p>Ehehe, Sitri laughed.</p><p>“Sorry. You wanted to monopolize the exploits by blocking the pursuit by yourself, right? By doing so, you would have been able to raise the reputation of the human girl you bring around with you by that much. But that’s too bad, hm? I can’t sit around and let you monopolize the ball, Skinnybones.”</p><p>“Your Highness. I will not deny that I did not have that sort of intention, but······.”</p><p>“Yup. It’s not that you didn’t have that sort of intention, but that that was the only intention you had.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“Insects are interesting. Just watching over them is interesting. Why do ants move around like that without taking any breaks? How are honeybees able to easily maneuver when hit by the rain even though they have hair? Why do fireflies live while illuminating their bodies and entice humans by doing so? Although there are times when I get so enthralled while watching these insects that I unconsciously end up sentimentalizing that they are all doing these things in order to make the world beautiful······.”</p><p>Whenever the soldiers walked passed the two of us with torches in their hands, they would salute us. We did not receive their salutes. Sitri was smiling with her eyes and looking at me&nbsp;only.</p><p>“Ei. That’s a misunderstanding. They’re just doing all that because they want to live. Isn’t that right? In order to live, they either become beautiful by chance or they&nbsp;become unsightly by chance. You’re the same, Skinnybones. To the exact same degree, you’re like a bug.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“For the peace of the demon continent? For the glory of the Crescent Alliance? Ahaha. You may be able to deceive big sis with those words since she’s someone who sincerely believes in those things, but Skinnybones, I know for certain that you aren’t that kind of person. You reek. The scent of a bug that has rolled around in shit for all of its life emanates from people like you to an intolerable degree—.”</p><p>Yes.</p><p>That was a fact which I could not deny.</p><p>Since a stench that could not be obstructed even with that innocent smile of hers was also exuding from the beaming woman before me.</p><p>People were capable of recognizing their peers. In that regard, Sitri and I were undoubtedly similar types of people.</p><p>It was a matter of course that people would be capable of recognizing others who have lived their entire lives in a way similar to their own, but there are times when those relationships work out well and advance into being first loves, and there are other times when those relationships make the two people into mortal enemies. The standard by which those relations were&nbsp;divided, was most likely excessively simple.</p><p>“Your Excellency.”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“Are you that afraid of being at Her Highness Paimon’s side and attending to her?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Sitri tilted her head.</p><p>“What is that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“Is Your Excellency not also referring to yourself as a bug-like fellow?”</p><p>The night.</p><p>As the soldiers went further into the distance, the line of torches followed suit. Similar to how there was a lasting mute vibration after the end of a song, even as the light grew distant, it illuminated the darkness of the road before vanishing. Sitri became shrouded in darkness and stared at me with turbid eyes.</p><p>“Your Excellency enjoys reproaching this one, but this one apologizes. In the end, the words which Your Excellency spit at this one will simply return to Your Excellency as is.”</p><p>“This is strange.”</p><p>Sitri tilted her head further and become further enshrouded by the night. Her face was expressionless.</p><p>“This is really strange. Was it yesterday, or the day before that? Didn’t we clearly define our standings? Is it perhaps my memories that are faulty? Or is there a problem in my brain—? Cause from what I can see, you’re messing with me right now, Skinnybones.”</p><p>“Your Excellency will probably be incapable of feeling interest towards words such as peace and glory throughout the rest of your life. I understand. The intriguing part is the fact that Your Excellency feels as if that personality of yours is, from beginning to end, wrong.”</p><p>“Skinnybones.”</p><p>“Does Her Highness Paimon appear that blinding to Your Excellency?”</p><p>“Dantalian.”</p><p>“It is only right for all people to be equal. If there are no nations like that, then you just have to make one from now on. With just that simple reason, Her Highness Paimon had erected a republic. There are people in the world who live simply because of that reason alone. There were······. Did Her Highness Paimon, did Her Highness Paimon’s form, appear beautiful to such an extent?”</p><p>“I, definitely warned you.”</p><p>“Compared to her, how is your own self like? Is Your Excellency not a piece of trash who does not feel inspired by anything······? My apologies, Miss Sitri. Your Excellency has already admitted it. Your Excellency has acknowledged that while living, one will become beautiful by chance and become unsightly by chance. If we follow Your Excellency’s pet theory, then even if Her Highness Paimon appears beautiful, this is solely by chance, and even if Your Excellency is as unsightly as a bug, this is also solely by chance. In the end, it is all the same. It is the same standard. There is no need to deny it. There is no special difference between Her Highness Paimon and Your Excellency⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>White static flickered before my eyes.</p><p>Once I had come to my senses, I found myself on the ground and breathing heavily.</p><p>A sticky feeling. The sensation of something shattering.</p><p>I instinctively gripped my right shoulder. A sizzling pain was running rampant. My skull felt prickly. Sitri had grabbed my shoulder and broke it in an instant.</p><p>“······Hu, haa······.”</p><p>“Ah.”</p><p>The tone of her voice sounded like a person who had done something by accident. A tone with a weight that felt as light as that was flowing over my head.</p><p>“Sorry. I sometimes, really sometimes do things like this. I lose my rationality. But don’t blame me too much. Normally,&nbsp;I give about two warnings&nbsp;before I lose my rationality, but you’re the one who ignored them, right? Does it hurt a lot?”</p><p>Sitri lowered her back. I was barely able to muster enough strength to look up, but once I did, I saw that Sitri had a sincerely worried look on her face.</p><p>Her eyes looked so feeble that if I had forgotten my own family tree, then I may have mistaken this woman as my biological older sister. Is it not fortunate that the child who could have possibly been my biological older sister was stillborn?</p><p>Sitri muttered to herself ‘What to do, what to do······’ as she stroked my injured shoulder.</p><p>“So why did you act up like that?”</p><p>She then dug her finger into my injury.</p><p>“⎯⎯⎯⎯!”</p><p>An intense pain.</p><p>I tried to let out a cry, but it was impossible. Sitri had blocked my mouth with her other hand. Press, preeesss······. Slowly, while opening up my wound, each time Sitri’s finger wiggled inside of my flesh, an electric current went down my spine. All of the nerves in my body felt like they had been torn.</p><p>I lost the strength in both my arms and legs and fell forward. Sitri received that body of mine in her embrace as if she were some benevolent priest. She whispered into my ear.</p><p>“Yup, good boy. Good.”</p><p>“······!&nbsp;······uk,&nbsp;······.”</p><p>“You’ll be nicer from now on, right? Don’t act so conceited. Don’t act like you know it all either. Don’t get greedy in order to get somewhere too high up, and don’t get unreasonably jealous just because you want to know too much······ Okay?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>This damn psychopath.</p><p>“I know. I know you better than anyone else. Big sis Paimon doesn’t know you and Barbatos probably doesn’t even try to know you. Skinnybones, children like you are the type of people who I understand the most in the world. It’s hard, right? It’s difficult to endure the world since you were born much smarter than others, right······?”</p><p>“······,&nbsp;······.”</p><p>“You want to live while looking down at them all. You want to live while crushing them all beneath you. It’s really fine. People, even Demon Lords, can be modest to others. Isn’t that a relief? The fact that a bug like you can also be modest. Skinnybones, how many people have you killed so far? You even started something like a war······ haa. It’s all your fault, isn’t it? In the first place, you’re a person who was wrongly born. A child who shouldn’t have and would have been better off not being born. So······ from now on, let’s live while atoning for your sins, okay?”</p><p>Sitri removed her finger from my wound. I let out a gasp. Sitri then grabbed hold of my face with her hands and held it in place so that I was staring straight at her.</p><p>She touched the corners of my eyes. They were wet.</p><p>“Don’t worry. You may be a dirty beast, but big sis Paimon isn’t. Skinnybones, you should also devote yourself to big sis’ ideals. If you do that, then even your body will at least be a slight bit useful. All right? Don’t misbehave. Even that succubus girl with arrogant eyes who has forgotten her place.”</p><p>Lapis Lazuli as well.</p><p>“Even that human girl who should have just obediently killed her breath while living in a whorehouse after she was sold as a slave, but was instead taken under your wing and is now slaughtering her own kind.”</p><p>Laura De Farnese as well.</p><p>“Even your royal guard girls who survived until now by spreading their asses to all sorts of Demon Lords.”</p><p>Humbaba and the other witches as well.</p><p>“Although you’re all rotten mongrels. Although you’re all pieces of trash that would have made the world a better place if you all weren’t born, it’s okay. It’s all okay while you’re following big sis Paimon. You can breathe. Realize your baseness by yourselves and become modest. Okay?”</p><p>I did not answer.</p><p>I simply glared at Sitri with pain-filled eyes.</p><p>Sitri smiled as if she were feeling sorry for a troublemaking child.</p><p>“What a pitiful thing.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“A pitiful thing that is beyond salvation and was born astray. A thing that was born broken. A thing that has become more broken after birth. Why is it that venomous snakes like these continue to be born into the world? If they’re going to be born broken, then it’d be better if they just died the moment they’re born. It’s a difficult thing. It’s a difficult thing to understand. I’ll sympathize with you all. I’ll guide you all. It’ll probably be difficult to throw away your greed, but I’ll help you throw it aside. It’s a difficult path. I understand. I’ve walked that path before after all. Even the small grains of dirt scattered across the road will hurt if you step on them with your bare feet. You guys don’t know pain because you’ve been steeping on dirt with the soles of your leather shoes. Your greed is your leather. Take it off. Throw it away. Acknowledge the fact that you all are worthless and unnecessary pieces of garbage. Yeah. It’s a difficult path. It’s difficult to do.”</p><p>However, Sitri uttered and stroked my cheek.</p><p>“Repent as best as you can.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“I’ll repel our pursuers. If I make my soldiers lie in wait around the narrow path and ambush the enemy as they pass by, then even that Imperial Princess won’t be able to do much. They’ve most likely been moving nonstop throughout the day and night after all. Skinnybones, just go to the back and be on standby. The hardest task for people like you is being made to wait without being able to do anything, isn’t it?”</p><p>Although I was twisting my body in pain, I managed to&nbsp;barely&nbsp;raise the corners of my mouth. This Demon Lord had pointed at me and said that I was pitiful. It has been a long time since I last received sympathy from someone, so it was not that bad. The problem was the fact that, as expected, I was starting to feel sympathy for this woman as well.</p><p>“······With things like this······ I am unsure as to which side is trying to monopolize the exploits now. Are you that afraid, of this one’s acting general······ standing tall as the ruler of the battlefield?”</p><p>“Yup. It’ll be troubling if you freely touch the political situation any more than this.”</p><p>So is that why you are saying that you will be the one to obstruct Elizabeth Atanaxia Evatriae von Habsburg?</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>That girl. That girl who was born as an emperor’s daughter and had torn off the skin of her siblings with her own hands. That girl who, in the original timeline, had exterminated all of the Demon Lords and established an empire. That monster.</p><p>All right. On one side was a woman who had thrown herself away, and on the other side was a woman who had thrown the world away. Watching the two of them oppose one another and seeing who wins was not that bad of an idea. However, I shall make a single prediction.</p><p>You will be defeated.</p><p>Ungracefully. Without&nbsp;even&nbsp;being able to counterattack. You are competent,&nbsp;but since a person who is more competent than you is your enemy, you will face utter defeat.</p><p>What sort of expression will you make? Will you resent the world? Will you curse at yourself? Will you forever abandon the world as something to resent and eternally leave yourself as someone to be cursed······?</p><p>Similar to how you are sympathizing with me, I sympathize with you as well. O Demon Lord whose hair color is the same as both water and fire. What else can the world be to you except Hell?</p><p>It was at the time the two of us were pushing each other back with our breaths.</p><p>“⎯⎯⎯Sitri? Are you over there?”</p><p>Paimon’s voice could be heard from a distance away.</p><p>Twitch.</p><p>Sitri’s body moved. I also drew my brows together. Once I looked over her shoulder, I could see Paimon tilting her head towards our direction from about 20 footsteps away.</p><p>It was night.</p><p>A peculiar tension bound itself around Sitri and myself. In her position, it was most likely fortunate that she was holding onto me. My body was exquisitely hidden so Paimon could not see me from the position where she was standing. Sitri glanced at my eyes for an instant before speaking in a voice that sounded no different to her casual tone.</p><p>“······Yeah, big sis. I’m here. What’s up?”</p><p>“You did not return to our quarters no matter how long I waited. Rather, is something the matter, Sitri? Why are you crouching on the ground like that?”</p><p>“Ah, it’s just. I found a dead stray dog.”</p><p>Sitri spoke in a voice that sounded jubilant. With only her gaze, she spoke to me with the coldness of her eyes.</p><p><strong>Be quiet. Shut up.</strong></p><p>“A stray dog? Really, Sitri. Even though you cut down humans with ease while on the battlefield, you are kind to animals like cats and other creatures of the sort. Is it already dead? You are trying to bury it, right? Let this lady assist you.”</p><p><strong>Ehehe</strong>, Sitri’s mouth laughed.</p><p>“No, it’s okay, big sis. This fellow spilled a lot of blood as it died. I have no idea how it survived with this much blood in its body······. I’m, sort of really soaked. I don’t want to show my dirty appearance to you, big sis, so you can go back to the quarters first.”</p><p><strong>If you move your mouth even slightly,</strong>&nbsp;Sitri’s eyes spoke.</p><p>“Truly, this child is warmhearted······. All right, this lady understands. But do not return too late. This lady will be departing with Barbatos soon. Sitri, we will be unable to see each other for a while, so let us share some drinks.”</p><p><strong>Big sis</strong><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>Sitri’s mouth was delighted.</p><p>“Of course. If I don’t go to see big sis off, then who will? I’ll be there as soon as I bury this dog and get washed up, so wait for me there. I actually have a bottle of alcohol that I’ve been keeping to myself for a long time just so I could drink it with you, big sis.”</p><p><strong>I’ll kill you,&nbsp;</strong>Sitri’s eyes threatened me.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>To her, the world was simply an enemy, a danger, and a wall. I called the lives whose worlds were enemies, dangers, and walls, beasts. Is she a beast? Was she a beast?</p><p>“Oh my, this lady is looking forward to it. Your preference in alcohol is surprisingly luxurious after all. This lady will make sure to drink it all.”</p><p>“Ei, drinking it all would be&nbsp;just&nbsp;mean. Big sis is also a&nbsp;surprisingly&nbsp;good drinker. Make the one on duty today prepare some snacks. I’ll definitely be there soon.”</p><p>I simply watched the one-man play this woman was performing&nbsp;from up-close.</p><p>While I watched her, I recalled the noises that I had left behind in my previous life. The study. The loud shouting flowing in from outside of the door. The woman who had rushed to me and apologized. The sound of music······.</p><p>Yes. It was music. It was a melody. What sort of gap must they cross in order for it all to become a melody?</p><p>To some, life was nothing more than a couple of noises. Once, twice, thrice, and if you are lucky, it sparkles four times. Something that struggles shortly but ends as a short vibration before coming to a close.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Something that could have possibly been connected, but, in the end, could not be connected because it had been forgotten.</p><p>Something that will never be able to stretch itself even once in its life. Therefore, something that can only be seen on the ground throughout its life, so it ends up reaching its end while following the footprints left behind by others. Something that truly comes to an end. Truly. Was that and solely that not the problem?</p><p>Who would save that sort of life?</p><p>······.</p><p>Paimon left. Once a single woman left, the area became silent as if no one had come here in the first place.</p><p>Even after Paimon had left, Sitri glared at me for a long time. After glaring at me, she too eventually left. Although the last remaining woman had also left, this area was dark and still as if no one had ever left in the first place.</p><p>It happened late in the night.</p><h4>▯King’s Beloved Slave, Berbere Witch Sisters, Captain of the Royal Guard, Humbaba</h4><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 14</p><p>Polles, Vistula Forest</p><p>“Should we really be goofing around like this?”</p><p>“Weeell, it’s a superior officer’s order. It’s our duty as peasants to do what we’re told, even if it’s to show our asses.”</p><p>“Whisper whisper.”</p><p>We witches were having a pleasant chat while&nbsp;enjoying a tea ceremony. Yeah. Well. What? It may be surprising, but even we have tea ceremonies&nbsp;sometimes. Although we usually don’t.</p><p>Despite our appearances, we’re cultured people. Ahah. Although it’s a tea ceremony where we roll dice and the bitch who rolls the lowest number has to gulp down a mouthful of muddy water, it’s natural for highly sophisticated groups to add some spice to their recreations. If anything, you can measure the level of a group’s sophistication according to how stimulating their seasoning is. Tea ceremonies where you just drink tea with no added seasoning is actually considered to be fairly barbaric. In that regard, I can confidently say that we possess a considerable amount of refinement.</p><p>Yeah. Well. What? Do you have a problem?</p><p>“Pour! Drink!”</p><p>“There’s not a lot of muddy water in this vicinity. Drink carefully. This is extra precious water. We went really far to get this just for you. There was a pool of muddy water with a lot of bugs in it and a pool of muddy water with not that many bugs in it, so I contemplated about which water I should bring back to you, but no matter how much I looked at it, I felt that the water that was more full of life would be of higher quality. In order to prove that the muddy water’s quality is good, I also scooped up the bugs that were living in it. Wow. Even when I think about it, I feel like I’m extremely sincere when it comes to my comrades.”</p><p>“That’s more damnably sincere than it is extremely sincere. To be more exact, you have quite the damned personality, but that’s only if someone like you even has a personality.”</p><p>“Whisper whisper.”</p><p>If there were problems, then it was probably three things.</p><p>First, the fact that these bitches are crazy.</p><p>Since this is an issue that’s no different to the usual, it’s an irrationality that can’t be fixed until the world comes to an end. Yup. The end. It can’t be helped. My dear fellow witches. They were crazy since the moment they were born, so please look over this.</p><p>Second, the fact that our surroundings are rather arid.</p><p>The spring rain which had started in the north had now completely gone south. Although there was a swamp area if we went further ahead from here. Right now, we couldn’t go there carelessly. Because of that sloppy bitch, Demon Lord Sitri’s order, our forces were currently waiting in ambush.</p><p>Third, the fact that not only was our surroundings dark, but it was really dark as well.</p><p>It was night, but we were also in an aspen forest right now. Not a small forest, but one of those so-called sea of trees which covered the entire area. If you wished to go in a straight line from Bruno Plains to the Black Mountains, then this was the path which you had to take no matter what.</p><p>We were currently hiding at the tail end of that forest. We couldn’t even light our torches since we were waiting in ambush. It was so dark that these damn bitches couldn’t even properly see the results of their own dice tosses. You could easily tell that this was the case because every time these bitches rolled their dice, they would keep reporting that they got the best result.</p><p>“Ah, I got double sixes again!”</p><p>“What a coincidence. I also got double sixes.”</p><p>“Whisper whisper.”</p><p>“Oh? To my knowledge, the chance of rolling double sixes is about 3 out of 100, so this is quite the astounding situation. For something that&nbsp;has&nbsp;roughly a 27 out of 1,000,000 chance of happening to have occurred here in this very spot.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“What are you talking about? Since she and I got double sixes, wouldn’t the probability be around 9 out of 10,000?”</p><p>“Mhm. I’m saying that because I also rolled double sixes.”</p><p>“It wouldn’t be enough even if these bitches were to lose their wrists. They’re bitches that’ll somewhat be worthy of entering gambling dens only if they actually lose their heads. There’s nothing surprising about this at all. They’re crazy bitches after all.”</p><p>In the end, because every single witch who joined the gamble had miraculously&nbsp;rolled double sixes, we all had to drink the muddy water. The sound of bugs being crushed and chewed on resonated throughout the darkness. How beautiful. Do you now understand why witches normally don’t do insane things like having a tea ceremony?</p><p>Within the aspen forest where the fragrance of spring was reverberating and the odor of female beasts in heat was pungent. Only the spot where our master, Dantalian was located was being lit by candles. General Farnese was whispering to our master beside him.</p><p>“The exact size of the pursuing army······.”</p><p>“Mm. Since the enemy troops will also move while utilizing the darkness of night, detailing their military strength would be.”</p><p>Referentially, our master’s troops were completely alienated. It was Demon Lord Sitri’s dogmatism. Thanks to that, our seven thousand troops were all waiting here as a reserve.</p><p>Although our master all of sudden had his shoulder pierced, it seems he wasn’t that upset about it.

I see that your bullshit is bitter. Just go to sleep.”</p><p>It seems Farnese had gone insane for some unknown reason as she had  abruptly confessed her love to me, but I had kindly turned her down in  less than 3 seconds. This girl has always been crazy, so her confessing  to me was not even slightly bewildering.</p><p>Farnese expressionlessly contemplated.</p><p>“How strange. What is the issue? Humble as this young lady is,  this young lady’s beauty is quite exceptional. If this young lady were  to speak closer to the truth, then this young lady has yet to meet a  woman who is more beautiful than this young lady. Is Your Lordship truly  a eunuch?”</p><p>“Oh? Is it because you have just returned from playing with fire? You’re spouting nonsense with that mouth of yours.”</p><p>“........This  young lady loves you? I love you, Your Lordship? This young lady  believes that she loves you, Your Lordship. I adore you. I cherish you? I  am loving you? This young lady truly loves you. This young lady devotes  her time to you, Your Lordship. This young lady’s sun. This young  lady’s midday. This young lady’s light and melody. The sunlight that  shines down upon the clumps of ash.”</p><p>“Now you are spouting bullshit.”</p><p>“This young lady wishes. This young lady hopes. This young lady  desires. This young lady wants Your Lordship to turn this young lady’s  time into a melody. Your Lordship? Oho. I see. Ehem. Was that the  problem?”</p><p>What did she realize?</p><p>Farnese looked at me confidently.</p><p>“This young lady loves you, father.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>I hit Farnese by the back of her head.</p><p>What she referred to me as was not the issue here. My daughter who is sick at heart. This lunatic child.</p><p>“Who’s this? Who could this beee?”</p><p>Additionally, the witches had all returned with their lives intact  and they were now in the middle of bullying Ivar Lodbrok. Ivar Lodbrok  was sitting motionlessly in our camp, so they were skipping around him  and spieling amongst themselves.</p><p>“No matter how I look at it, it appears that there’s a familiar bat  here. As his mug is a bat and his physiognomy is a bat, there’s no doubt  that this is seriously a bat-like bastard. The fellow who made me  believe that, throughout my entire life, I would never be able to meet a  person who’s more bat-like than him, seems to be right before my  eyes—?”</p><p>“Strange, how strange. From what we can remember, this is definitely a  fucking bastard, but why is a fucking bastard residing in our master’s  military camp? Has our master finally decided to take in even fucking  bastards? Aha aha, as days go by, our master’s royal grace is becoming  more ravenous.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok stayed seated and merely kept his mouth shut, not giving  the witches any sort of response. However, if I were his lawyer, then  once more, I would have advised against pleading the Fifth here. To the  witches, the opposition’s response did not matter to them by even the  smallest, littlest, or tiniest amount after all. Look. Are the witches  not happily performing a circle dance around Ivar while holding each  other’s hands now?</p><p>“We thought—.”</p><p>“Thought and thought again—.”</p><p>“Thought like a person who had nothing to do except think about that—.”</p><p>“The fact that our master was confined in a cell for a week.”</p><p>“Aah, that fact means our master was unable to wash for an entire week.”</p><p>“Aah, that fact means our master was unable to fap for an entire week⎯⎯⎯.”</p><p>“Ah, such grief. La-di-da, such grief.”</p><p>“We thought.”</p><p>“Since ancient times, if a male skips a day of fapping, then it’s both joyous and sorrowful.”</p><p>“Thought and thought again.”</p><p>“If they skip two days, then it’s a tragedy. If they skip three days, then it’s an atrocity.”</p><p>“Thought like a person who had nothing to do except think about that.”</p><p>“Aah, alas, such grief. Our poor master, our master who was unable to  fap for an entire week. As your faithful subjects, there’s no way that  we wouldn’t sing a song about it.”</p><p>“Ah, such grief. La-di-da, such grief.”</p><p>“We thought.”</p><p>“About Master’s long period of no fapping?”</p><p>“Thought and thought again.”</p><p>“About Master’s pitiful no fapping!”</p><p>“Thought like a person who had nothing to do except think about that.”</p><p>“Ah, such grief. La-di-da, such grief.”</p><p>“Look at those dwarves with small maws, look at those wolf bastards  with long maws, look at those sons of horses with long and pointed mugs,  and look at those pigs with plump stomachs. Ah, everyone come close and  look at the blood-sucking old man over there. We’ll sing a single  plaintive melody, so listen.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“.”</p><p>In the end, those crazy girls started to sing in unison.</p><p>Ο</p><p><em>An old man asked</em></p><p><em> Which Demon Lord has the largest penis in the world</em></p><p><em>  We answered</em></p><p><em>   The person’s name is Dantalian with a sorrowful penis</em></p><p><em>    The old man inquired</em></p><p><em>     How impressive must it be for you all to praise it so</em></p><p><em>      We replied</em></p><p><em>       It is a penis that shoots faster than the wind</em></p><p><em>        It is a penis the hair of which is denser than a forest</em></p><p><em>         While it is a penis that is hotter than fire</em></p><p><em>          It is a penis that is more steadfast than a mountain</em></p><p><em>           But what is the point</em></p><p><em>            Since there was no place it could be used for over a week</em></p><p><em>             That is clearly the most pitiable penis in the world</em></p><p><em>              Thus, we sing like this</em></p><p><em>               The person’s name is Dantalian with a sorrowful penis</em></p><p><em>                Dantalian with the saddest penis in the world</em></p><p>Ο</p><p>“.”</p><p>I went silent.</p><p>“.”</p><p>Ivar Lodbrok went silent as well.</p><p>“Ah. Referentially, this young lady was the one who had composed this  song, Your Lordship. Since this young lady’s genius, which resonates  throughout the world, has gone into this, you can be moved and cry as  much as you desire. Even this young lady must admit that quite the good  chord has gone into this.”</p><p>The lunatic did not go silent.</p><p>Eventually, Humbaba, the leader of the witches and the Captain of the Royal Guard, spread both of her arms out wide.</p><p>“Dantalian with the saddest penis in the woooooorld—.”</p><p>It wasn’t until she had sung this line passionately that the madness had reached its zenith and then subsided.</p><p>It seems that the witches were most likely under the illusion that  they were actresses in a cheap opera right now. It was an incredibly  eccentric scene, but at the same time, it was not eccentric at all. If  you considered the fact that their brains are usually in the state of  being steamed by drugs, then this was not strange at all.</p><p>“See? I said that I made a super great song, didn’t I? Ahahah. How  was it, my beloved fellow witches? Do you girls now admit that I do  indeed possess quite the amazing artistic talent?”</p><p>“I admit it.”</p><p>“I concede.”</p><p>“It’s something that I must admit.”</p><p>“It’s also something that I can’t not admit.”</p><p>“Sorry, Master! We were originally going to come back to your side a  little sooner, but listen to this. There were human prisoners loitering  about waaay over there, you know? Ehem, aha, ehem ehem, as experts of  both torture and execution, it’s not like we couldn’t bestow upon them  our kindness.”</p><p>“Well, executions nowadays aren’t able to vivify the feeling of the  past no matter what they do. Compared to the past, the world has become  quite weak.”</p><p>“That’s right. Back in my day, when they cut your flesh, they didn’t  cut it normally. If anything, you’d be thankful if all they did was cut  your flesh. They used to tear off all of your skin, pour a potion on top  of your bare flesh, healing you completely, before tearing it off  again. I was able to endure that twice, but it started to get difficult  after the second time.”</p><p>“Eh, only two times? Are you saying that as if that’s some sort of  experience? I’m able to stay sane for at least the first 5 times,  girly.”</p><p>“I’m not trying to brag, but I didn’t lose my senses even when my  internal organs had been cut into pieces and my flesh had been peeled  off thirty times. On the contrary, my mind became clearer each time my  flesh was ripped off, so it felt as if something like torture could not  possibly invade my prestigious mind.”</p><p>“I wonder about that. Instead of saying that you didn’t lose your  senses, I feel like that just means you were never sane since the moment  of your birth.”</p><p>What the hell are these girls talking about?</p><p>I had a faint headache.</p><p>If a person possessed a mouth, then they should be making sounds, but  these girls were babbling while only letting out noises. Therefore, I  was certain that the things which these girls possessed were not mouths,  but assholes.</p><p>“You all may not know this, but I’m a witch who had her blood sucked  by a vampiric archduke back when I was really popular. It’s a bit  embarrassing to say in front of you girls, but in truth, my lineage is  so great that I actually shouldn’t be hanging around with girls like  you.”</p><p>“Rather than words being said to our faces, those sound like words you’re saying to our butts.”</p><p>“I smell a fart coming from somewhere. Did someone fart?”</p><p>“It wasn’t me.”</p><p>“It wasn’t me either.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Why are you looking at me? It absolutely wasn’t me either. You can  easily tell just by looking at my innocent face that my butt isn’t a  butt that would fart.”</p><p>“It’s more suspicious because you’re denying it that much. The  thought that it’s undoubtedly you since you’re denying it like this  comes to mind. Ah. I was perfectly logical just now.”</p><p>“You’re suspicious for suspecting me so much. I don’t know if you’re  perfectly logical or not, but I know for certain that you’re a perfectly  crazy bitch.”</p><p>“Judge, please enter.”</p><p>“Now then, now then. From what I can tell, this is quite the foul  incident. Just from its scent, you can tell that this flatulence doesn’t  have the normal kind of foul stench.”</p><p>“What is the verdict, then, Your Honor Humbaba? The people are  currently rioting outside of the court of law. Please remember that it  was the people who had appointed you as the city’s judge.”</p><p>“The political judge who accommodates witches should step down!”</p><p>“Step down! Step down! Step down!”</p><p>“Ehei, ehem. Sheesh, this is troubling. Calm down, you lot. If it  wasn’t you, me, or any one of us, then I’m certain that the one behind  this flatulence incident is none other than our master.”</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>“This is an unexpected conclusion.”</p><p>“Do you have evidence? Evidence?”</p><p>“The smell of the flatulence itself proves who its owner is. The  reason why the smell of this flatulence is so foul is due to the fact  that our master had held it in throughout the entire week he was  imprisoned and had just now let it loose.”</p><p>“That’s nonsense!”</p><p>“Were those words just now or was that a fart? The judge is the one farting right now!”</p><p>“Boooo! Witch trial! Let’s do a witch trial!”</p><p>“Whoa there. Ehem. If you perhaps object to this verdict, then this  judge will have no other choice but to suspect that one of your adorable  butts was the one to have committed this crime.”</p><p>“A flawless verdict.”</p><p>“Acknowledged.”</p><p>“As expected of Captain Humbaba. That was a beautiful verdict.”</p><p>“For Lord Dantalian to have been the culprit behind the  fart. This is all my fault. If I had known sooner, if I had  realized a little sooner.”</p><p>“No, Euryale. It isn’t only your fault. Our apathy towards His Highness Dantalian’s butt is what had brought upon this tragedy.”</p><p>“Big sis.”</p><p>“My son!”</p><p>“Damn it, this is touching. It’s been over 50 years since I was  appointed as a judge, but this is the first time I’ve witnessed such a  sorrowful scene. It’s impossible for this judge to not shed tears here.”</p><p>“What a coincidence. After watching all of your conducts, this great one could shed tears of blood.”</p><p>I was watching over these crazy girls while wondering how much of  their brains they had thrown away in a ditch. The more I watched them,  the more I grew curious about the name of the bastard who was crazy  enough to make these girls into their Royal Guard. If it weren’t for the  fact that that crazy bastard was me, then I may have been a bit more  curious.</p><p>“Ahahah, master.”</p><p>Hop.</p><p>Humbaba skipped towards me and stuck out her cone hat.</p><p>Curious as to what this girl was now up to, I looked down and saw  that there was a bunch of dirt inside of her hat. After examining the  muddy pile of dirt a bit more, I saw that it was a pile of dirt with  several dandelions sticking out of it.</p><p>Did she put them in her hat without even dusting the dirt off from  their roots? There were dandelions contained in the witch’s hat. I  knitted my brows.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>“We contemplated and contemplated about what the likes of us could  possibly give to you, Master, as a gift to celebrate your release. No  matter how much we thought about it, we weren’t able to think of a gift  that could make you happy, Master. Even if the likes of us were to offer  Master our bodies, Master has always been a eunuch, so what good would  that do when you won’t taaaake us?”</p><p>“I see that you girls believe that every male in the world must  respond to you. How should I fix that misunderstanding of yours? If  anything, do you not know that there are only a small minority of males  in the world that will respond to you girls?”</p><p>“Master’s absolute majority is mistaken. History proves otherwise.”</p><p>“I do not wish to know about that sort of history.”</p><p>For there to be a history where responding to these girls was the  correct thing to do and not responding to them was the wrong thing to  do. What was that supposed to be? The Necronomicon? Was this like a  textbook of evil or the Devil’s scroll of incantations?</p><p>Humbaba shoved her left hand into her hat. The left hand which I had maimed by severing the ring finger of at one point in time.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>There was a lot of moisture in the clump of dirt, so the inside was  exceedingly dirty. Even if it was unclean, that dirt was unclean because  it was alive. The small witch in front of me plucked a dandelion, which  was unclean because it was still alive, with a ‘snap’.</p><p>“Master. Ahah. It’s a bit late, but.”</p><p>After she placed the dandelion behind my ear.</p><p>“Congratulation on your release!”</p><p>She smiled radiantly.</p><p>“.”</p><p>I was at a lost for words for a moment.</p><p>The witches giggled. It was light. It was truly a light sound. The  sound of laughter easily spread into the sky and permeated with ease.  And I believed that that lightness, was like that because it had thrown a  small bit of its life away somewhere.</p><p>Farnese spoke.</p><p>“Your Lordship. It seems that among the masses, people consider the  act of putting a flower behind your ear as proof of one’s insanity.  Coincidentally, it appears that there is a flower behind Your Lordship’s  ear. This young lady is not trying to go out of her way to provide an  additional explanation or anything, but it is just that, this young lady  simply wishes to say that Your Lordship has coincidentally become an  insane person.”</p><p>“If my brain has yet to necrotize, then Farnese, were you not passionately confessing your love to me only a few minutes ago?”</p><p>“? What of it? Is there a meaningful correlation between Your Lordship’s lunacy and this young lady’s love?”</p><p>This young girl who was tilting her head and sincerely questioning me  as to what sort of correlation the two had, was the child I had taken  in as my adopted daughter in this world. How insane. Truly regretful. By  the looks of it, it seems that this life will be dirty just like my  previous life.</p><p>Nevertheless, I did not excessively complain today.</p><p>I simply.</p><p>“Hoeh?”</p><p>“Hoi?”</p><p>With my right hand on Farnese’s head.</p><p>And my left hand on Humbaba’s head, I stroked both of their heads and spoke.</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>For winning a difficult battle.</p><p>For being the first person to gift me a flower ever since I had fallen into this world.</p><p>I am grateful to you both.</p><p>My Acting General and Captain of the Royal Guard looked at each other  for a moment before eventually smiling radiantly like a hydrangea and a  dandelion that had bloomed side by side.</p><p>“This young lady loves you, Your Lordship.”</p><p>“I really like you, Master!”</p><p>Regardless of what sort of enunciation that love was said with and regardless of what sort of hope that like was said with.</p><p>We were already a family.</p><p>Ο</p><p><img data-attachment-id=\"48713\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2017/01/05/dungeon-defense-volume-4-chapter-1/25x25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png\" data-orig-size=\"25,25\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"25×25\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=25\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=25\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=700\" alt=\"25x25\"></p><p>Ο</p><p>The advent of the Crescent Alliance.</p><p>It was most likely thanks to the fact that we had strongly obstructed  the pursuers in Vistula Forest, the sea of trees. Barbatos and Paimon,  the main army of the Crescent Alliance were able to cross the Black  Mountains without having to face any danger whatsoever.</p><p>On the very night the battle had ended in the sea of trees, the two  Demon Lords had both sent a letter. Barbatos and Paimon were currently  busy pushing ahead with their march. They had both only written a single  line in their letters.</p><p>Ο</p><p>— Thanks. We’ll be going first. Follow.</p><p>— Sorry. I’ll leave Sitri in your care.</p><p>Ο</p><p>When in a situation where one had to say thank you and also apologize  to a single person, then there are people who would say thank you first  and there are people who would say sorry first. Barbatos was the  former. Paimon was the latter. The difference between the former and  latter was definitely due to the rift that had torn the two apart in the  past.</p><p>I strolled through the military camp which we had set up throughout  the entire night and gazed up at the afternoon sky. A group of soldiers  noticed me as they were passing by and saluted to me. I shook my head  and omitted their show of respect.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“The monarch should be the one to show their respects to the soldiers  who have triumphed. You all have fought well. You all have held out  well. A lot of meat has been provided, so today’s meal shall be  substantial.”</p><p>The soldiers expressed their gratitude and continued on their way.  Even if I was nothing more than ranked 71st, I was still an honorable  Demon Lord. What cute fellows. I chuckled at the natural modesty of the  officers and men and went into deep thought once more.</p><p>Elizabeth, the Imperial Princess was defeated. She had lost  some of her troops. Her perfect record of victory had been smeared as  well. However, defeat was nothing more than an immediate disgrace, the  Imperial Princess had obtained something larger.</p><p>The fact that when the Crescent Alliance retreated, she was the only  person to have declared for the battle to continue until the very end.</p><p>The fact that she had actually led the pursuit in person with her royal standing.</p><p>The fact that while she was leading and fighting in person, her royal body had actually been injured.</p><p>I lamented by myself.</p><p>“The commoners of humanity will most likely cheer. They will cheer loudly.”</p><p>Justification.</p><p>When the other nations were reluctant to step forward and the  majority of the armies were chickening out, the justification of having  stood forward without any hesitation in order to exterminate the demons.</p><p>The battle in Vistula Forest was fierce, desperate, and severe. Both  of the individuals who could be referred to as the heads of each  respective side had been hit by a bolt. If they had been even slightly  more unlucky, then they could have died.</p><p>Soldiers naturally respected generals who would charge forward even  while in the face of danger more than anyone else. It was not only the  soldiers. The simple commoners will also cheer the birth of a  hero.</p><p>The undefeated blonde general who was favored by the Goddess Athena.  That was Laura De Farnese. Imperial Princess Elizabeth was no different.</p><p>“On one hand, there is a blonde general, and on the other hand, there is a silver-haired empress.”</p><p>These two could only be stopped by one another. It was like that in  the original history as well. In this life, I had accelerated the  inevitability of history more fiercely. Even in the future, the  continent will most likely rock under the military ability of gold and  silver.</p><p>Last night, Imperial Princess Elizabeth had lowered her guard. She had mistaken Farnese for a dead corpse or a puppet.</p><p>A bitter mistake, O Elizabeth. She may have been like that when you  had met her previously, but that was not the case last night. Farnese  had bloomed in less than a couple of days. I, this child’s lord and  father, had made this happen.</p><p>In consequence of the time of a mere couple of days, you were  defeated yesterday. You were most likely unable to predict this. You may  have even thought of this as cheating. Regardless, the place where your  absence of awareness was located was where your incompetence laid, and  the point where you considered this as cheating was where your limit was  placed.</p><p>‘There is no way that someone could change within a few days.’</p><p>That was the incompetence and limit which you possess. A person is  able to change within a few days, and if they have the assistance of  another, then even more so.</p><p>From this point on, the war you and I will create will always possess  the time of several days. Perhaps, it will be a war that vies for the  time of several hours. Even on the noon of the day where an unparalleled  victory had been obtained, I am already predicting the next war.</p><p>It was in that moment.</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>In the distance, a single group of cavalry units was approaching from  the other side of the military camp. Were they friend or foe? If they  were neither, then were they deserters? I narrowed my eyes and gazed  into the distance.</p><p>The cavalry unit was holding up 3  banners. First, a white flag which represented that they wished to  negotiate and not battle. Next, a black flag with the dark moon of the  Crescent Alliance engraved on it. And finally, a fluttering flag that  displayed who they were affiliated with and radiating a golden shine. </p><p>A maxim was written on the banner.</p><p>Ο</p><p>Know thyself.</p><p>Ο</p><p>“.”</p><p>A banner that was half white and half red. Adding to that, a maxim  that was sewn on with golden letters. The one who strives to coexist  between peace and war, and strives to bask in the glory of gold while  within that coexistence.</p><p>Ranked 5th on the demon continent.</p><p>The lord in charge of nobility.</p><p>The sacred and inviolable representative of absolute dignity.</p><p>“Demon Lord Marbas.”</p><p>The monarch of the Neutral Faction was lurking in the distance.</p><h4>▯The King of Peasants, Rank 71st, Dantalian<div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p> Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 15</p><p> Polles</p></h4><p>Ο</p><p>‘This is reckless.’ Lapis remonstrated.</p><p>‘This young lady will be unable to protect you.’ Farnese advised.</p><p>‘Well, Master is nuts, so if need be, this one will die together with you!’ Humbaba offered.</p><p>While having refused the remonstration, keeping the advice in mind,  and shouldering the offer, I, Dantalian, headed towards the Neutral  Faction’s military headquarters.</p><p>The night was dark as midnight had passed. The only one who could be  called my guard was Humbaba, but even then, she had been disarmed.  Additionally, they had gone as far as to inspect Humbaba’s undergarments  after having stripped her of them. Her flesh which had been torn due to  the long period of torture she had endured was displayed in plain  sight.</p><p>“Ahahah. I haven’t hidden anything, I have nothing to hide. I really  don’t have anything on me. Do you think I’m crazy enough to mess around  with the Demon Lord who has a mortgage on my soul? I’m Humbaba. The head  witch that leads the Three Nightmares. I’d be delighted if you showed  some respect to the Quadriphllyous medal that’s attached to my hat.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>The sentry looked Humbaba up and down before giving a nod. Humbaba  was then allowed entry to the Neutral Faction’s camp. It was really  after they had checked every nook and cranny of her body.</p><p>Humbaba was all smiles.</p><p>“Did you see that, Master? It’s because of behavior like this that I  end up believing that the absolute majority of the males in the world  desire my body. Even if I try to go somewhere comfortably, they do this  kind of nonsense.”</p><p>“My God. Your entire life is your own self-torment.”</p><p>“Aha, I can’t deny that. As expected of Master. If you added the fact  that my self-torment is my own torture, then it’d be perfect.”</p><p>We walked together as master and servant while murmuring to each  other. The soldiers of the Neutral Faction followed us closely on both  of our sides. The torches held by the soldiers illuminated their  expressions. As one would expect from elite soldiers, they were all  expressionless, but despite that, they would occasionally furrow their  brows whenever they glanced at Humbaba.</p><p>How long did we walk for, I wonder.</p><p>We were guided to a particularly massive tent. It was a military tent  that was made by connecting tiger pelts together. Due to the fact that  both Barbatos and Paimon did not have a personality that quibbled over  the luxury of their quarters, the tent that I was currently seeing was  the most luxurious one I have ever seen.</p><p>All of the sentries that were standing guard at the entrance had a  Diphyllous medal attached to their helmets. The medal that was in the  form of a leaf was an honor that was only bestowed upon those who had  participated in a Crescent Alliance and had performed a meritorious  deed.</p><p>As this was the 8th Crescent Alliance and the expedition had yet to  end, those medals were undoubtedly from the 7th and 6th expeditions.  This meant that the sentries, whose numbers reached slightly over  twenty, were all veteran warriors who were able to survive for the past  200 years. Humbaba needlessly behaved like a restless shih tzu and  pointed at her own cone hat.</p><p>“MasterMaster. Look at this. This one has a Quadriphllyous.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>“At most, all they have are Diphyllouses. Ahahah. This one is twice as strong as them!”</p><p>Wow.</p><p>The sentries glared daggers at us the instant Humbaba had spat out  those words. I am still a Demon Lord in spite of my appearance. I passed  my hand over the horn attached to the back of my head and whispered.</p><p>“Even if you say that you have four leaves, did you not receive  your fourth leaf by kowtowing before Her Highness Paimon after having  performed some trickery? I beg of you. Keep in mind the fact that we are  in the middle of an army that may or may not abruptly become hostile  towards us.”</p><p>“Eeh. But I have a chronic disease where I become sullen if I close my mouth for even a moment.”</p><p>“At the very least, can you not whisper in a voice which only I can hear?”</p><p>“Gasp. Don’t tell me, was that perhaps a secret confession to this  one? You mustn’t, Master. This one already has a master who she has  devoted her affection to, so this one cannot possibly give Master this  one’s body!”</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>What more could I have expected from you?</p><p>Just grow up healthy.</p><p>While receiving the clear glares of the sentries, Humbaba and I  continued to chat. Once nearly half an hour had passed, a low voice  resonated from within the tent.</p><p>“Demon Lord Dantalian, enter.”</p><p>The tone of the voice was antique. However, a harsh growl which could  not be entirely placated by the antiquity lingered in the voice. I  wonder if this is how it would sound like if a brown bear were to learn  the language of people.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I brushed Humbaba’s hair behind her ear.</p><p>“I will be back.”</p><p>“Yes, Master.”</p><p>Humbaba smiled brightly.</p><p>“This one will be waiting. Always.”</p><p>Ο</p><p><img data-attachment-id=\"48713\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2017/01/05/dungeon-defense-volume-4-chapter-1/25x25/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png\" data-orig-size=\"25,25\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"25×25\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=25\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=25\" src=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/25x25.png?w=700\" alt=\"25x25\"></p><p>Ο</p><p>Similar to how the military tent appeared grand on the outside, it  was vast on the inside as well. I believed that I resided in a luxurious  tent because of how much money I had spent on it, but the quarters  which the head of the Neutral Faction resided in was on a different  level.</p><p>12 attendants were all lowering their heads in silence. 6 royal  bodyguards with either a sword attached to their waist or a spear held  in their hands were gazing at me. A red carpet was laid out on the floor  of the tent and a large throne was situated on the edge of the carpet. A  monarch was obliquely resting his back on that very throne.</p><p>Within a place that should not be referred to as a tent.</p><p>But would be better off being referred to as a palace located in the center of an enemy campsite.</p><p>“Dantalian.”</p><p>The monarch spoke.</p><p>“It is admirable for you to have come here alone. Are you here to answer my call?”</p><p>Marbas stared straight into my face.</p><p>His face was close. His gaze was unwavering. The monarch’s many years  of experience were spread across his face as wrinkles. The monarch’s  firm persistence spread through his steady shoulders. As someone who did  not distinguish between beliefs and life, a monarch who has only  gathered beliefs with life and life with beliefs was seated in front of  me. He was a perfectly firm monarch.</p><p>“The last time I saw you was immediately after the speech declaring the onset of war. Were you not imprisoned?”</p><p>I lowered my head and answered.</p><p>“This one’s sins had been forgiven, so this one was released.”</p><p>“So I have heard. Were you released on the same day on which the tragedy on Bruno Plains had occurred?”</p><p>“Yes, Your Excellency. That is the case.”</p><p>“I have also heard that you are Barbatos’ lover. Allow me to ask you this; were you, in any way, involved in that tragedy?”</p><p>“.”</p><p>I contemplated for a moment.</p><p>Lying in this situation was an easy task. I was confident in my  ability of deception as well. There were also many different ways of  answering this question in a vague manner. However, feigning ignorance  was most likely not what was important right now. Naturally raising the  favorable impression which this monarch has of me was more crucial.</p><p>‘In good terms, he is a principlist.’ Paimon had commented.</p><p>‘In better terms, he’s a damn aggressive old fossil.’ Barbatos had commented.</p><p>‘And he is a bald old man.’</p><p>‘And he’s a bald old man.’</p><p>These weren’t particularly important comments.</p><p>I shook my head as I mentally marveled at my own accursed memory.</p><p>“Your Excellency, this one had witnessed the tragedy with this one’s  very own two eyes. As this one could not stop it despite having  witnessed it, even if this one could stop it, this one would have not  done so, therefore it would be shameful if this one were to claim that  this one was not involved in that tragedy in any way.”</p><p>“That is an appropriate and sound argument. Raise your head.”</p><p>I did so.</p><p>The monarch was wearing a monocle over his right eye. The candles  located here and there throughout the tent would occasionally angle  themselves towards the monocle and cause it to shine. Although it was  difficult for me to look straight at the monarch’s face, the monarch  looked me up and down entirely.</p><p>“Dantalian, since you are the youngest amongst us and have the lowest  rank, I assume that you had barely any involvement with that incident.  Even on the very day where blood was shed, you were most likely unable  to get involved at all as you were doing your time behind bars. Amongst  all of those fellows who are going around claiming to be the Crescent  Alliance, you alone are innocent.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“This one is honored, Your Excellency.”</p><p>That wasn’t the case at all.</p><p>I regret to inform you, Marbas, but if one had to pick out who was  the main culprit behind the bloodshed, then I am the very first person  who should be pointed at first. Originally, I am the one who you should  be hostile towards the most. Regardless, there is no other choice but  for you to have this sort of misunderstanding.</p><p>Because.</p><p>“Barbatos and Paimon had mercilessly set you at the rear, they had  left you behind and made you take on the approaching humans. There is no  doubt that they had turned you into a sacrificial lamb under the  condition of your release. Do you not feel vexed?”</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Because no matter how you look at my situation, people would only be able to see it<strong> like this</strong>.</p><p>“.”</p><p>Aah, I laughed inside of my head. In spite of all of my  consideration, Imperial Princess Elizabeth and I were the same. For us,  the victory and defeat of battles were nothing more than secondary  issues.</p><p>Victory was beautiful and sweet, however, was defeat not humiliating  and disgraceful? In the very rare chance you are faced with a battle  where you can be humiliated and disgraced, you must make sure that it is  a battle where you are able to obtain something even if you are  defeated. Traditionally, engaging in only these sorts of battles was the  proper thing to do.</p><p>The Imperial Princess was defeated. Despite that, she had obtained a  justification. That justification was an item which she could obtain  regardless of her victory or defeat. Hence, that was the reason why the  Imperial Princess had pursued us to the sea of trees without any  hesitation.</p><p>I had triumphed. However, even if I were to have lost, my innocence  would have been proven either way. To the other demons, I was a poor,  pitiable, and pathetic individual, an underling who had been played  around by Barbatos and Paimon before being tossed away like a hand of  cards.</p><p>I had won. However, even if our forces had won, what had I been  doing? Where was I when Farnese had been hit by a bolt and the witches  were putting their lives on the line? In the rear. I was setting up an  encampment in the safe backline and taking in the stragglers.</p><p>Although I had won, since it was a victory which was clearly not due  to my own efforts, I was standing one step to the side of the glory of  victory. Some people may consider this treatment to be  unreasonable⎯⎯⎯but I deem this to be the most beautiful conclusion  imaginable.</p><p>I felt as if I could hear the public ridiculing me from even here.</p><p>— Demon Lord Dantalian. An individual who had somehow gained a  windfall, however, he wastes his wealth unsparingly for his lowly lover  because he is a fool.</p><p>— Demon Lord Dantalian. He was fortunate enough to somehow recruit a  genius as his general, however, he never goes out into  battle himself because he is a coward.</p><p>— Demon Lord Dantalian. An individual who was somehow able to survive  to this day due to pure luck, however, he is constantly used by  Barbatos and Paimon because he is an idiot among idiots.</p><p>A lecher. A coward. An idiot.</p><p>How beautiful these whispers are.</p><p>On this vast continent, the number of monarchs who are aware that I  am acting behind the scenes can be counted on a single hand. Barbatos,  Paimon, Sitri, Ivar Lodbrok, and Elizabeth. There was no one else beyond  these individuals.</p><p>Five people.</p><p>A mere five people.</p><p>It was a performance where I had to face only five people.</p><p>On the other hand⎯⎯⎯aah, Elizabeth. O Elizabeth whose silver locks  are elegant. Imperial Princess who was born with the other half of my  soul, behold the countless number of rivals whom you must face!</p><p>Elizabeth. Every sovereign that is currently reigning in the human  continent is afraid of you. This is because they had a premonition of  you becoming a storm that will raise a new wave and swallow up the coast  of the current age.</p><p>Elizabeth. Even your aged biological father, the Emperor of  Habsburg, is afraid of you. This is because he knows by intuition the  fact that the blade which you have been sharpening until now will be  used to stab him in the back and take his life.</p><p>Elizabeth! Have even the Demon Lords of the demon continent not  come to recognize you? You, who should have been silently subduing the  human continent south of the Black Mountains, were discovered 10 years  early. This is because I had courteously invited you to the stage.</p><p>Elizabeth.</p><p>Imperial Princess whose red eyes resemble the color of blood.</p><p>Empress who, during the previous night, had shed blood for a moment  after having been assaulted by Farnese in the darkness. You are  competent to no end. Because you are competent to no end, you will no  longer be careless when going against Farnese. Thus, in the next battle,  you may even possibly bring Farnese to her knees. Not only the next  battle, but the battle after that, and the battle after that, you might  even come out victorious in the fourth battle and the fifth battle that  follows after that. Even if everyone in the world does not believe in  your victory, <strong>I alone shall believe in you</strong>. You are an empress who was originally destined to conquer the world, that is how sublime you are.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>‘But for how long?’ a single lecher asks.</p><p>‘For how long will you continue to win?’ this coward taunts.</p><p>‘Will you win forever and triumph eternally?’ this idiot scoffs.</p><p>Are you trying to handle Farnese by herself? Manage her. You will be  able to do so. I am aware that you are capable of handling her with  ease. However, are you also capable of handling every sovereign in the  human continent and every Demon Lord in the demon continent at the same  time? Is that something which can be handled just because you said you  could handle it?</p><p>Look. This lecher, coward, and idiot is asking you a question. A  question that is more important than anything else. A question shared  solely within our breaths as they mix together.</p><p>Elizabeth.</p><p>Can you handle the entire world?</p><p>I can. Aah, it is more than possible for me. Why? Because I had made  it so that I had less than five cast members to deal with early on!</p><p>Five! Even if I possessed a talent that is slightly lacking when  compared to yours, I am not obscure to the point of being incapable of  dancing around with a mere five people.</p><p>Five! Even if my plots are insufficient and my schemes are poor when  compared to yours, they are more than enough to toy with five people and  run the show.</p><p>Five! One of those five fingers, Ivar Lodbrok, has already fallen and  is now my slave. Now the number of people I have to deal with has  decreased by one. What have you decreased while I was lowering my  numbers? By some chance, did you not actually increase your numbers?</p><p>Five! One of the obvious five fingers, Demon Lord Sitri, has  descended to a position where it was now difficult for her to raise her  face while in front of me because she had lost to you. According to my  intelligence, she and Zepar had been captured as prisoners by Demon Lord  Marbas. Very good. How pleasant.</p><p>Sitri still refuses to submit to me. It was too soon to pull down her  final bulwark. However, not only was her fall going to happen soon, but  this was also a <strong>preordained plan</strong>. Once it happens, this will mean that another leading actor among the main five will step down from my stage.</p><p>I spend my time leisurely while on my gradually diminishing stage.  You are the complete opposite. The stage which you must handle will  continue to broaden ad infinitum. I shall give you my applause and  cheers. Go ahead and try to perform a one-man play while on a stage that  goes against the world.</p><p>Will you not be beautiful?</p><p>Will you not crumble beautifully?</p><p>Will you not exude a fragrance when you crumble?</p><p>Elizabeth, Atanaxia, Evatriae, von Habsburg.</p><p>Even in this moment, I draw you in my mind.</p><p>Do not be too disappointed just because you were unable to meet me in  the forest of white aspen trees. If we were unable to meet, then that  simply means that it was not yet the time to meet. Be patient. You and I  are each other’s fate. When waiting for one’s destiny, that wait is  simply a happy melody. Until the day our fate strikes the earth like a  thunderbolt, we have to be happy by waiting.</p><p>“Dantalian.”</p><p>Look.</p><p>A supporting actor who was as terrifying as a bear was standing over there.</p><p>However, no matter how terrifying he was, he was nothing more than a  supporting actor. Was that not the case? Now let us listen to what he  has to say.</p><p>“You no longer have to be afraid of Barbatos and Paimon who have  tossed you away. Be embraced within my shade. I shall take you in. Stand  underneath my banner. I shall lead you. Look towards the direction  which I point. I shall promise you.”</p><p>Good. This was the language of a monarch who lived life. I could  smell the scent of dirt. How beautiful. Clouds of dust would most likely  billow if war horses were to charge on top of this ground which had  been dried by the sun.</p><p>“I promise a crown land where our kind will not kill one another. I  vow that it will be a kingdom where people will not be killed even if  there is a reason for them to be killed. Even if I collapse and break  apart, at least this promise and vow will be eternal. How about it,  Ranked 71st Demon Lord?”</p><p>The monarch continued.</p><p>“Will you follow me?”</p><p>“.”</p><p>I made the smile of my heart stop at my heart and composed myself.</p><p>My expression was still calm and my complexion was temperate. My  voice did not reflect the temperature of my heart so it was serene. I  slowly lowered my head to make it appear as if I was being pressured by  Marbas’ grandeur.</p><p>“Your Excellency. Your Excellency’s royal grace is immeasurable  and inscrutable. If this one were allowed the opportunity to rest  underneath Your Excellency’s shade, then how could this one possibly  refuse? However, before this Dantalian, this humble one can entrust this  one’s pitiable body to Your Excellency, there is something which this  one must tell Your Excellency first.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Do you wish for a private audience?”</p><p>“Yes, Your Excellency.”</p><p>“You all may leave.”</p><p>There was no one who dared to question his order.</p><p>The sound of both the attendants and bodyguards’ footsteps seeped  into the carpet before it soon subsided. The sound of breathing coming  from slightly over twenty people had disappeared in a single effort. The  extravagant military tent was more forlorn because of that very  extravagance.</p><p>The monarch spoke.</p><p>“What do you wish to tell me?”</p><p>“This one is the emissary of both Barbatos and Paimon.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>The air was cold.</p><p>Marbas looked at me quietly. I wonder if he was angry or if he was  looking at me carefully. It was hard to fathom. Similar to how I had  composed the temperature of my heart and did not let it appear in my  voice, it seems that Marbas did not allow the temperature of his chest  to flow out from his gaze.</p><p>“If you are an emissary, then does that mean you have a letter which you must deliver to me?”</p><p>“This one does not have such a thing.”</p><p>“Then how is someone like you able to consider yourself as an emissary?”</p><p>“Because this one has an item which proves that this one is an emissary.”</p><p>“Show me.”</p><p>“This one shall present it to Your Excellency, but.”</p><p>I bowed my head once more.</p><p>“Before that, this one must first convey the words which both parties had passed on.”</p><p>“I shall allow it. However, bear in mind the fact that your life is resting on top of a blade.”</p><p>“This one always has the preservation of this one’s own life as this one’s utmost priority, Your Excellency.”</p><p>I cleared my throat.</p><p>I adjusted my clothes and raised my head.</p><p>I stared straight at the man before me. A large physique with a  shoulder span that was wider than my own by three times, was looking  down at me. However, I could not be overawed. Since I had set myself up  as the emissary of both parties, I was no longer ranked 71st, the  youngest of Demon Lords, and was now the representative of both the  Plains and Mountain Factions.</p><p>“I convey this message not to the Neutral Faction but to Demon Lord Marbas alone.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>“We purposely did not inform you of our plans beforehand.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>A wavering appeared in the gaze of the monarch who had resembled a  serene lake until now. Of course, it was not a well-disposed wavering  towards me. As if he intended to give me a single opportunity to explain  myself before releasing his wrath, Marbas frowned as he glared at me.</p><p>I explained.</p><p>“Your Excellency, both parties did not inform Your Excellency about  the purge on purpose. Although this action is a behavior that is nothing  short of ridicule, it was, at the same time, for Your Excellency’s sake  as well.”</p><p>“Those are fickle words. How was it for my sake?”</p><p>“From this point on, the Crescent Alliance will be engaging in an  all-out war against the Demon Lords who had remained on the demon  continent. Nevertheless, even if we will be engaging in an all-out war,  is there a need for us to wipe them out? How could uprooting every  single commoner who resides in the territories ruled by the other Demon  Lords be the will of both parties?”</p><p>“.”</p><p>After all is said and done, Barbatos acted for the sake of the  people. It was an arbitrary love and hatred. Paimon also loved the  people. It was a self-righteous affection. Although they were arbitrary  and self-righteous, there were no other monarchs who acted for the sake  of demonkind more than these two Demon Lord.</p><p>“If the war lasts for a long period of time, then a time where a  ceasefire is necessary will come. Even if it is not a ceasefire, an  agreement will be established. If an agreement is to be established,  then would there not be a need for a person to be in the middle in order  to mediate the two sides? Would it not be difficult for a person from  either side to act as a mediator?”</p><p>“.”</p><p>“Your Excellency, the sin for having betrayed the Crescent Alliance  and selling out our fellow kind is unspeakably immense and deep, but if  both parties were to have discussed this matter with Your Excellency  first, then they would have been able to convince Your Excellency with  ease. This one assumes that several parasites hiding in Your  Excellency’s shade would have been sent to the afterlife as well.  However, if things were to have gone that way, then coming to an  agreement would have been next to impossible and we would have been  faced with an excruciatingly difficult situation.”</p><p>The monarch went silent.</p><p>“So was I excluded for the sake of the peace that will follow afterward?”</p><p>“That is correct.”</p><p>“What are your true intentions behind not having brought the  information you had conveyed to me in a letter and presenting it to me  like that?”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“There are too many eyes around Your Excellency. Starting from Rank  1st Baal and all the way to Rank 4th Gamigin. Similar to how their eyes  were looming close to the Plains and Mountain Factions, they are most  likely hiding within the Neutral Faction in an identical manner. If this  one were to have brought a letter, then there is a chance that it could  have been revealed when this one’s body was searched. Regardless of  whether the contents of the letter were revealed or not, the very  information that ‘Dantalian had a secret letter’ would have been passed  on to someone. Conveying the message and trust through a letter was  dangerous.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>“Your Excellency, I beg for your understanding.”</p><p>Understanding.</p><p>The act of looking deeply into a candlelight.</p><p>By simply looking only at the light burning in a lamp, looking past  the things which can and cannot be seen and feeling them out.</p><p>Fathoming the connection between light and light.</p><p>Similar to how I had connected smoke with smoke all the way to the  other side of the Black Mountains, the ones who were capable of pulling  this off were monarchs, and they could only be monarchs by managing  this.</p><p>“Please believe in Your Excellency’s comrades of both parties who  have been together with Your Excellency on battlefields for over four  hundred years. Her Excellency Barbatos and Her Highness Paimon are sworn  enemies, but for what reason does Your Excellency think that they had  joined hands for? Would it not be because there are parasites that are  more scornful than their own sworn enemies lying dormant behind them?”</p><p>“.”</p><p>Marbas closed his eyes.</p><p>The silence lasted solitarily within the military tent. The silence  was tenacious. The monarch’s wrinkles which could be seen through his  monocle were dark.</p><p>The monarch’s mouth finally opened after a long period of time.</p><p>“Those ladies who frolic so much that the world aches. Do they intend to give me the hardest role?”</p><p>“Yes. That is how it is. Your Excellency must pretend to fight and  quarrel with both parties. If Your Excellency’s performance is poor,  then the Demon Lords north of the Black Mountains will see through it  with ease.”</p><p>I bowed with respect.</p><p>“Your Excellency, please take me hostage and breach the Black and  White Fortresses. Pursue the two parties as if you are chasing them as  fast as possible. At this moment, the Demon Lords north of the Black  Mountains are most likely preoccupied because of the Crescent Alliance’s  withdrawal. Their field of vision will become narrow and Your  Excellency will most likely be the first person to appear in their field  of vision. Take advantage of that.”</p><p>“I have already captured Zepar and Sitri. Do I need more?”</p><p>“The more, the better, Your Excellency.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>The monarch groaned slowly.</p><p>“It is you who is the loyal subject to all of demonkind. Despite  having been sent to prison by them, you follow both Barbatos and Paimon  without any complaints and you offer yourself as a hostage for the sake  of the demon continent. Dantalian, I give you my respect.”</p><p>The monarch then stuck out his left hand.</p><p>I surmised that Marbas wanted to shake hands with his left hand and  not his right hand. It was from now on. The act of pretending to be  hostile towards the Crescent Alliance was going to start from this point  on.</p><p>“This one is honored, Your Excellency.”</p><p>It was at the moment I was about to accept his handshake.</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Squeeze.</p><p>Marbas grabbed my left hand with his rough grasp. For an instant, an  immense pressure pressed down on the bones of my hand. Marbas gripped my  hand just strong enough that it was barely short of making my bones  creak and forcing my flesh to scream. Thanks to this, my expression had  crumbled quite a bit.</p><p>“Your Excellency, what are you.”</p><p>“Where is the evidence that proves you did not tell a lie?”</p><p>Marbas glared at me carefully.</p><p>“I am already aware that you are a smooth talker. I too was present  in Niflheim when you had made Paimon kneel. How will you guarantee me  here that you do not have treacherous intentions and that you are not  planning to ridicule me and taunt the Crescent Alliance with that  eloquence of yours?”</p><p>“.”</p><p>“Where is the guarantee that we will not be ambushed while we are in  the middle of making our way through the Black and White Fortresses  after having been tricked by you? Dantalian, your expression is gentle  and your eyes are soft, but there are plenty of swindlers out there in  the world who are capable of camouflaging their complexions. How will  you prove to me that you are not just ridiculing me?”</p><p>Surely. This was not bad.</p><p>The man before me did not waste his days as the head of the Neutral  Faction in a slovenly way. This much wariness was obvious. Because it  was obvious, I was obviously able to predict it. While an intense pain  was going through the bones of my hand, I smiled slightly.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>I have been earnestly waiting for this very moment.</strong></p><p>“O Honorable Marbas, if it turns out that this one had deceived Your  Highness, then that would mean that this one was deceived by the two  parties as well. This one has already requested Your Highness to take  this one hostage. If an ambush were to actually occur at the Black and  White Fortresses, then would it not be this one’s neck that would be  sent flying first?”</p><p>“That is correct.”</p><p>The monarch nodded.</p><p>“Therefore, the problem is very simple. <strong>How much do Barbatos and Paimon trust you? </strong>This  is the only issue which I must verify and you must prove. If Barbatos  and Paimon possess a brain inside of their heads, then they would have  definitely left with you a token of their trust. Have you brought one?”</p><p>“Of course, Your Excellency.”</p><p>I slowly took something out from my pocket.</p><p>An item which looked normal at glance and was something anyone who was reasonably rich would carry around with them.</p><p>Marbas knitted his brow when he saw the item.</p><p>“Hm? Is that not a pocket watch?”</p><p>“It is not a pocket watch, Your Excellency. It is a memoria artifact  which contains essential evidence. The witches that are under my command  enjoy enchanting pocket watches with memory magic, so I have been using  it quite handily.”</p><p>“Hooh.”</p><p>The pressure that was grabbing my left hand gradually diminished.</p><p>“That is considerate. If an emissary were to come with only a verbal  message, then they would easily be doubted, but if you were to hide it  within a watch, then you would be able to avoid this suspicion.”</p><p>“Your grace is immeasurable, Your Excellency.”</p><p>“All right. I am certain that that is a record which will display the  weight of the trust that is lying on your shoulders. Go ahead and play  it. I shall watch it carefully.”</p><p>“It is too soon for such words, Your Excellency.”</p><p>Without any hesitation, I started to turn the hour hand of the pocket  watch once I had been given the order to do so. Once at midnight. Once  at midday. Once at midnight again, and back to midday. The hour hand,  minute hand, and second hand of the pocket watch started to spin  fiercely while letting out an audible ‘vrrr’ sound before smoke  started to flow out from the crevices of the watch.</p><p>And then.</p><p>Once I shined the watch on the smoke, it started to project the recording.</p><p>— Auh, heuuuh!?</p><p>“.”</p><p>Marbas froze.</p><p>The sound of moans flowed out consecutively from the pocket watch.  The silence of the military tent was broken capriciously. The honorable  Demon Lord Marbas was simply staring up at the air with the same  expression which his face had solidified into 10 seconds ago.</p><p>— No! Stop! Please, hey, wait, don’t!?</p><p>— When did I allow you to speak words? A pig should oink like a pig!”</p><p>— Mm, oinkoinkoink, ooink!</p><p>I grinned widely.</p><p>Although the work of art that had recorded Lapis had been destroyed  and will no longer be able to obtain the honor of being the world’s  first, this work of art here was undoubtedly the world’s first to  feature a Demon Lord in the leading role.</p><p>“.”</p><p>“Your Excellency had instructed this one to show you the evidence of  how much trust Her Excellency Barbatos has in this one, correct?”</p><p>Now then.</p><p>I smiled broadly while displaying my rare and valuable work.</p><p>I was being projected on the smoke and in that scene with me was a  woman. The woman coincidentally had hair that was white and gave off a  silver shine, coincidentally had horns sticking out of her head, and  also coincidentally had golden pupils.</p><p>— All right. What am I? Go ahead and say it with your own mouth. What am I, Dantalian, to you?</p><p>— Master. Lord Dantalian, mm. Is my, Barbatos’ master!”</p><p>And coincidentally, her name was Barbatos.</p><p>“.”</p><p>Without moving even a single inch, the head of the Neutral Faction  was like a statue as he watched the recording which displayed the head  of the Plains Faction referring to me as Master and being ridiculed. It  seems that he had received the biggest shock he had ever experienced in  his life and it had struck him right on his head. Space was also  infinite and time was eternal.</p><p>5 minutes passed.</p><p>It was a beautiful 5 minutes.</p><p>“.”</p><p>“.”</p><p>Marbas was still.</p><p>I was smiling broadly.</p><p>“That.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Don’t tell me.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“No, but?”</p><p>“That is the case.”</p><p>“Truly?”</p><p>“Surprisingly.”</p><p>“But, no matter how you think about it, the roles are.”</p><p>“This one thinks so as well.”</p><p>“Thus, it was not done by force but voluntarily?”</p><p>“This one shall mention that in this recording, this one did not have any free will whatsoever or even an inch of initiative.”</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Marbas opened his mouth.</p><p>“Nevertheless, contrary to my expectation, are you not enjoying it as well?”</p><p>“Your Excellency, never once in this one’s life has this one ever  suspected Your Excellency’s political neutrality, but that statement  just now is raising a slight bit of doubt in this one. By all means,  please be discerning.”</p><p>“Surely.”</p><p>Marbas let out a long groan.</p><p>“Barbatos, that reckless girl has finally obtained her mate.”</p><p>“This one does not wish to mention it, but instead of getting rid of  this one’s doubt, Your Excellency is increasing it more. This one can  assure Your Excellency that that body type is not this one’s preference.  If this one had to choose, then this one believes that Her Highness  Paimon is splendid.”</p><p>“Paimon’s appearance is indeed quite marvelous. She is worthy of her title of Queen of Mares.”</p><p>I nodded.</p><p>I then asked Marbas.</p><p>“Does Your Excellency now understand <strong>how trusted</strong> this one is?”</p><p>“.”</p><p>Marbas covered his forehead with his palm.</p><p>Marbas let his groans flow through the cracks of his fingers. It  seems that he wished to pull at his hair as he contemplated, but due to  the fact that no such thing was present on his head, it seems that he  earnestly believed that this fact was quite unfortunate. Roughly, it  seems that Marbas was Bhuddistically seeking out who I was, where I had  come from, and where I was going.</p><p>“.”</p><p>Thinking.</p><p>“Mmm.”</p><p>Anguish.</p><p>“Surely.”</p><p>And resignation.</p><p>“I understand. I shall trust you, Dantalian.”</p><p>After magnificently accomplishing the three steps of Buddhism, Marbas  let out a sigh. Regrettably, it seems that he was unable to fulfill the  final step of enlightenment, but who cares? It was fine. Regardless of  how foul my temper was, I am not so cruel that I would scold the sadness  of a bald man.</p><p>Therefore.</p><p>“This one will be in Your Excellency’s care from now on. Your  Excellency Marbas, it may be rude of me to ask, but will Your Excellency  be willing to listen to a single immediate ‘request’? Please consider  this as a reward for this one as this one had come all the way here at  this one’s own peril.”</p><p>“All right. No matter the wish, I shall willingly grant it as long as I am capable of doing so.”</p><p>I smiled truly refreshingly.</p><p>Empire Calendar: Year 1506, Month 4, Day 15.</p><p>A secret alliance has been concluded between the Plains and Mountain Factions, and the Neutral Faction.</p><p>However, it is said that the number of people in the world who know  about the decisive evidence behind the formation of the alliance can be  counted on a single hand.</p><p>FIN.</p>"

Sheesh. Look at their violent temper.</p><p>As expected, even the auras of a high-rank Demon Lord’s royal bodyguards were on a different level.</p><p>Be it the sentries or the attendants, they were all glaring at me and whispering to each other. It can’t be helped. They’re the ones who want to badmouth me, so, by all means, I should allow them to eat tastily. It’s fine, everyone. Chew properly, okay? Eat well. Chew. They say that you shouldn’t even mess with a dog when they’re eating, and in spite of my appearance, I’m a well-mannered girl. Ahahah.</p><p>—&nbsp;······To make a witch one’s captain of their Royal Guard······.</p><p>— How could such a noble personage appoint this kind of lowly peasant······.</p><p>— Harlots of souls with worn-out asses······.</p><p>Is it not amazing? Not only do people spew words from their mouths, but they spew words from their eyes as well. Yup. Strictly speaking, before putting an eyeball into those eye sockets, were those sockets not also holes?</p><p>Holes are holes. Something is either rammed into those holes or flows out from them, and that is what people believed in. Similar to how words come out of mouths and shit comes out of asses, something flows out from the eyes as well.</p><p>Scorn.</p><p>Ridicule.</p><p>Contempt.</p><p>In any case, similar to how people require their daily bread in order to live, to them, those were things they required in order to live in their own way.</p><p>— Hey, look at that. They say that’s a witch who’s lived for several centuries.</p><p>— She looks completely like a child······.</p><p>— She’s looking this way. She really looks annoying.</p><p>No. These were all irrelevant words. Hey, you young attendants over there.</p><p>Clack······ clack······, it’s starting to get really annoying because they’ve been tossing pebbles at me since earlier. You could easily get a grasp of the beautiful color and charm of their personalities by the fact that they were throwing pebbles and not stones. If I were injured by a stone, then regardless of the fact that he’s at the tail end of the Demon Lord rankings, it would mean that they had assaulted me, Master’s Captain of his Royal Guard. Thus, pebbles. Haah, these cheeky fellows.</p><p>······When’s Master coming back?</p><p>He’s late. A bit.</p><p>There’s nothing to do, so I might as well hum the song that I had written the lyrics of.</p><p>“The old man inquired— How impressive must it be for you all to praise it so—.”</p><p>Ah. I’m not saying this because I had created this, but this is a complete masterpiece. I’m serious. Be it the humans or the demons, in the end, monarchs compete in order to see who has the bigger penis.</p><p>The likes of us had mused over this, but no matter how we looked at it, the one who has the biggest penis in the world is our master, Dantalian.</p><p>“The person’s name is Dantalian with a sorrowful penis—.”</p><p>Master was that.</p><p>Not only was his penis big, but a peculiar lamentableness gloomed over it as well. It feels as if it should be called either sorrow or regret, but if you were to try and find an appropriate expression, then there was the shade of a person whose life was either fucked or had been fucked. Alas. Thus, as Master’s penis is a large penis, it was also the most sorrowful penis······.</p><p>My God.</p><p>Even I get shivers if I think about it. How perfect is my gift?! If Apollo were to see me, then he would despair so much that he wouldn’t come to work that day and make the world dark for the rest of the day. In other words, my gift is so formidable that it is capable of inadvertently stopping the sun itself······. If the sun stops, then everything in the world would stop, and if everything in the world stopped, then there would only be the last breaths of all things there, so, in other words, my gift is so tremendous that it could destroy the universe······. If the universe is destroyed, then even if space is infinite and time is eternal, there would be no point to them, so, in other words, my gift is so destructive that it could instantly make time and space useless······.</p><p>Humbaba.</p><p>How sinful this woman is······.</p><p>I know. I am well aware of my deep sin. I was gifted with a fate that could threaten the sun and all things just by being born. Every wandering minstrel in the world envies me and every flower bud in the world begrudges me, so the world has no other choice but to struggle against me by forming an anti-witch alliance.</p><p>So even those young attendants over there had received the&nbsp;mission to repel me, as they were the so-called informants among informants of the alliance······. How could this be? Without even being aware of their situation, I······ you insane pieces of shit throwing pebbles, it wouldn’t be enough to shove a stick up your asses, set those sticks on fire, and burn all of your internal organs, you’re fuckers who will only be able to fart for the rest of your lives······ had thought this, oh no······. Cry a little bit here, I went a bit too far, didn’t I······? I’m sorry. I apologize. From now on, I will try to understand everyone by considering each one of your situations a bit more······. Add some more tears here, I, Humbaba, will be born anew and pay everyone a visit as a better me······.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>Now then, was that enough? Haah, these cheeky fellows.</p><p>— It’s true. She really isn’t reacting at all······.</p><p>— See? She’s just singing like a crazy person.</p><p>—&nbsp;······They say they don’t have a soul. That’s why they stay as kids and stop growing······.</p><p>Yeah, It’s fine.</p><p>Go ahead and throw things at me. Everyone. Throw. If throwing that is what is needed in your lives, then it can’t be helped. In spite of my appearance, I’m a generous girl.</p><p>Tear me apart. While people live their lives, there are periods where they must bite into other people’s necks and have a taste of blood. It can’t be helped since all of your lives are broken. This generous girl will understand your desires to blame something which cannot be blamed.</p><p>Burn me. What can be done when burning people is something that’s needed in your lives? If you have to burn someone, then burn them. Chew properly. Have a nice meal. Eat. Despite my appearance, I’m a girl who doesn’t die easily. As it’s fine, it’s fine and also fine.</p><p>There’s no end to something being fine.</p><p>There are no bounds to something being fine.</p><p>That’s why the act of being fine is unlimited.</p><p>Hey, you attendants over there. If there’s a problem, then it’s you guys. The fact that there are ends and bounds to your lives. Ah, wouldn’t that be quite the problem? Did you know? Everyone, you’re going to die. You’ll all die.</p><p>That, throwing is all right, but you’re throwing away the days of your lives. You say that it’s fine to tear me apart, but you’re all tearing your own time apart while you tear me to pieces. You’ll die, you know? Are you going to keep burning me? Are you going to burn me again? What more do you intend to burn? Your own corpses?</p><p>Throw away a day.</p><p>Burn one by one.</p><p>Tear apart a day once more.</p><p>Burn one by one once more.</p><p>A day.</p><p>One.</p><p>And then.</p><p>Mm.</p><p>Gaya.</p><p>Let’s just smoke some gaya.</p><p>······.</p><p>Huaaaaah.</p><p>······.</p><p>Huuu, haaaaa······.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Well.</p><p>What?</p><p>What are you staring at, you attendants? Do you have a problem? I won’t sympathize with you people. I’m capable of doing so, but I won’t. I can’t. Do you know why? I don’t know what you guys hate the most in the world, but once you receive my sympathy, then in that moment, the thing which you guys hate the most in the world will automatically change into receiving a witch’s sympathy.</p><p>When’s Master coming back?</p><p>He’s late.</p><p>A bit.</p><p>······.</p><p>Ah. Fuck.</p><p>Hey, you attendants over there? Just because I’m not responding to you guys doesn’t mean that you should throw actual stones, you fucks. It hurts. Hey. Look here. It hurts. Hey! Ah, fuck, it hurts, you know?</p><p>Haah.</p><p>These cheeky fellows······.</p><p>While I was in the middle of pouring curses at those pieces of trash in my mind, from within the tent, a voice which I hadn’t heard in quite a long time flowed out.</p><p>“Send in Dantalian’s witch.”</p><p>Hoi?</p><p>I glanced around to see if I had misheard just now. The attendants and bodyguards were also looking around with the same looks on their faces. No one was able to respond, but a voice came from within the tent once more.</p><p>“Is no one there? I told you to send in the witch.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>Mmmm—.</p><p>I stood up from the ground and dusted my clothes. A bunch of pebbles poured down on the ground. The sentries glared at me with bloodthirst in their eyes. The attendants were panicking as they whispered among one another.</p><p>······This is strange.</p><p>I did become a witch after forming a contract with Marbas, but there was no doubt that Marbas had forgotten about me by now. An incredible amount of time had already passed since then. He wasn’t a Demon Lord who concerned himself with witches in the first place.</p><p>It was efficient to set up a witch as a sacrifice whenever a large epidemic passed by. He was quite the rational ruler who would occasionally use witches for that reason alone.</p><p>If you work well after having formed a contract, then he doesn’t concern himself with you aaat aaall. The one who managed me wasn’t Marbas either, it was one of his bureaucrats.</p><p>In good terms, he was an expedient person. In bad terms, he was a person who only concentrated on tasks that befitted Demon Lords after having passed down every dirty task to his subordinates. No. Well. Compared to Euryale who was caught by a pervert like Glasyalabolas and was presented 200 years of torture by the Demon Lord&nbsp;personally, I’m incredibly fortunate.</p><p>Mmmm.</p><p>But why is he calling for me?</p><p>During the 150 years, I went around the town plaza whenever an epidemic or a year of famine occurred, but I don’t recall ever meeting Marbas during those times. At all. Not even once.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>I’ve been incredibly successful lately, so I spend my days sleeping in the same tent as Master Dantalian, but normally, this is something that could never happen······.</p><p>In any case, I’m going because I was summoned. After dusting all the gravel off of me, putting my cone hat&nbsp;on&nbsp;properly, and obliquely holding up my broom, I hastily walked into the tent.</p><p>······.</p><p>“This lowly one has entered, as&nbsp;this one was ordered to do so by the Great Demon Lord.”</p><p>“Welcome.”</p><p>Master Dantalian welcomed me with a smooth smile the instant I entered.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>On the other hand, Demon Lord Marbas was looking this way while frowning. His royal countenance appeared to be firmly displeased with something. How overwhelming. I feel sorry for having to display a peasant like myself to such noble eyes.</p><p>Master spoke.</p><p>“Humbaba.”</p><p>“Yes, Master?”</p><p>“I had a&nbsp;deep conversation with His Excellency Marbas here. It was quite the deep conversation. It was a conversation that was so deep that&nbsp;it could have been dangerous&nbsp;if it were any deeper. As a result, we were able to share a type of friendship that transcends my and His Excellency’s ranks. It is a friendship which only men can understand.”</p><p>Oho oho.</p><p>There’s some leeway for this to be interpreted in quite the dangerous way.</p><p>Referentially, for people like me, when something could be interpreted either dangerously or safely, I’m a girl who always interprets it dangerously. What I mean is, a hole is a hole, isn’t it? Although something flows out from them at times, things are rammed into them as well. I’m not trying to say something in particular, I’m just saying.</p><p>“This one gives her congratulations.”</p><p>“······Hmm.”</p><p>Demon Lord Marbas let out a sigh as if he were dissatisfied. It must be due to his large frame, but even his sighs sound like the breathing of a brown bear.</p><p>“Dantalian, I suggest that you think once more.”</p><p>“This one’s decision will not change.”</p><p>“I had certainly said that I respected you. As one of the corps commanders responsible for the Crescent Alliance, the devotion which you had displayed naturally deserves to be rewarded. There are many things which I can bestow upon you as a reward.”</p><p>“Your Excellency is correct.”</p><p>Ara?</p><p>What are they talking about?</p><p>Even if I carefully examined Master’s expression, Master was simply smiling slightly. It’s hard to get a read on Master whenever he’s like this.</p><p>“I could give you commodities.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I could promise you a new domain.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I could also provide you with an appropriate amount of honor and reputation even if it may take some time.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“If you were to wish for wealth, then you would become wealthy, if you were to wish for strength, then you would become mighty, if you were to wish for honor, then you would become glorious. Do you truly wish to refuse all of this? Do you intend to reward your own devotion and sacrifice with something like this?”</p><p>“This is sufficient.”</p><p>Master gave a small grin.</p><p>“Compared to any royal gift this one could hope for from Your Excellency, this one believes that the thing which this one had mentioned earlier is the most valuable. It is not a lie. It is not an exaggeration either. Wealth is wealth regardless of whose hands it ends up in, a domain is a domain regardless of whose foot&nbsp;steps on it, and this one is not interested in honor or reputation. However, Your Excellency, no matter how vast the continent is, this alone is something which only Your Excellency can bestow.”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>“If it is not Your Excellency’s royal hands, then it would be meaningless. If it is not Your Excellency’s royal legs, then it would be useless. Your Excellency is benevolently offering to grant this one’s wish, but how could this one dare to raise a petition?”</p><p>“······.”</p><p>Ara.</p><p>Really, what are they talking about?</p><p>Although I’m confident that I wouldn’t lose in regard to reading the atmosphere of one’s superiors, I have no idea what is being discussed right now.</p><p>Master Dantalian was simply gazing at me with a gentle smile on his face.</p><p>And Demon Lord Marbas.</p><p>“······.”</p><p>Was looking straight down at me.</p><p>Most likely for the first time.</p><p>Was it 300 years ago?</p><p>Was it 400 years ago?</p><p>Because I had thrown things away for a variety of reasons, was torn apart by a variety of things, and was burned by a variety of things, my memory of that time no longer remains as a whole. During that time, there was no spring, there was no summer, there was no autumn, and there was no winter. In that season, my time was chopped up into pieces and split up into small fragments. Whenever I dreamed, only the groans of imprecating and imprecating, I could only hear that season where tens of thousands of screams remained as an auditory hallucination.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>“Witch Humbaba.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>And then.</p><p>After calling my name for probably the first time ever, Demon Lord Marbas⎯⎯⎯.</p><p>············.</p><p>······Eh?</p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-105081\" src=\"https://images2-focus-opensocial.googleusercontent.com/gadgets/proxy?container=focus&amp;gadget=a&amp;no_expand=1&amp;resize_h=0&amp;rewriteMime=image%2F*&amp;url=https%3a%2f%2fshalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com%2f2017%2f11%2feb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-413.jpg%3fw%3d700\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" srcset=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-413.jpg?w=700 700w, https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-413.jpg?w=103 103w, https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-413.jpg?w=205 205w, https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-413.jpg?w=768 768w, https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-413.jpg 820w\" alt=\"던전 디펜스 - Volume 5 - Page 413\" data-attachment-id=\"105081\" data-permalink=\"https://shalvationtranslations.wordpress.com/2017/11/26/dungeon-defense-volume-5-intermission/%eb%8d%98%ec%a0%84-%eb%94%94%ed%8e%9c%ec%8a%a4-volume-5-page-413/\" data-orig-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-413.jpg?w=700\" data-orig-size=\"820,1200\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"던전 디펜스 – Volume 5 – Page 413\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-413.jpg?w=700?w=205\" data-large-file=\"https://shalvationtranslations.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/eb8d98eca084-eb9494ed8e9cec8aa4-volume-5-page-413.jpg?w=700?w=700\"></p><p>“⎯⎯⎯I am sorry, small witch.”</p><p>······.</p><p>······Huh?</p><p>“Humbaba, I do not remember in what way I had wronged you.

It’s a rather nice way to wrap up the volume. With everyone’s favorite Humbaba! Or at least my favorite. In any case, I’ll leave this TL note shorter than usual since I’ll be posting an update post immediately after this. It’ll basically be about how long my short break will be and what series I’ll continue to translate next.</p><p>On a side note, I’m glad there are no more people complaining about the black pages. I think there’s only been a single person who complained about them this volume, compared to the dozens last volume. So yeah, that was a pleasant surprise.</p><p>In any case, see you guys in the future update!</p>"

      "content": "<div align=\"center\" style=\"padding-top:5px;padding-bottom: 5px;\"></div><h4>Afterword</h4><p>I’m digressing, but I believe that eyes are called eyeholes because tears flow out from them.</p><p>Hello, readers. And sorry. I’m currently kneeling down on both of my knees while writing this afterword. This isn’t a psychological figure of speech, but I’m actually physically kneeling. I’m typing this while kneeling.</p><p>Coincidentally, as my computer monitor is at the perfect height on my desk to apologize, and if you consider the fact that half of my life is spent on the computer, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that half of my life was born at a height for apologizing. I’m sorry······. My manuscript was excessively, extremely late.</p><p>While expressing my gratitude to cocorip, the illustrator of 〈Dungeon Defense〉, as per usual, I wish to also write my apology here. By periodically finishing my work and sending the manuscript, the illustrator will be able to draw each scene while taking their time, but I believe that this time around, it must have been incredibly difficult to work on the illustrations because of me. I’m sorry. Next time, I’ll resolve myself more.</p><p>So, along with my apology, I will also be speaking sincerely to you, my readers. In this volume 5 as well, cocorip’s illustrations have proven their specialty most satisfactorily. Please go back to the beginning of the book and look at the color illustrations once more. There is a sea that is exquisitely dyed in purple. Moreover, Humbaba is there looking this way while skipping around.</p><p>Is it not beautiful?</p><p>Furthermore, sitting on the right, marvel at Lapis Lazuli who is collapsed on the surface of the water, appearing as if she were drenched in water ever since the moment she was born.</p><p>Is it not beautiful?</p><p>In addition, behold Laura De Farnese who is sitting in a defenseless state while brushing her bang behind her ear, with a gaze that appears as if she wouldn’t go out of her way to block anyone who approaches her in a defenseless state, but wouldn’t particularly be interested in them either.</p><p>Is it not beautiful?</p><p>Additionally, although there’s a male standing in the center with some bath towel wrapped around his neck, please just ignore this child. I wonder what the significance of this child’s existence is. I don’t understand. For starters, the fact that he isn’t a beautiful girl makes this unknown man’s value drop by 90%. I’m saying this with the utmost sincerity.</p><p>Thank you to cocorip who drew beautiful illustrations this time as well.</p><p>Editor.</p><p>I’ve committed a grave sin······.</p><p>Editor, I thought that if I left land and went to an island, of course, due to its political and diplomatic characteristics this peninsula actually isn’t a peninsula and is no different to an island, in any case, if I went to a smaller island than that, to be exact, I thought that my manuscript would become better if I wrote it at Jeju Island. But because nothing came out even then, I thought that if I went into a Buddhist temple, the Beomeosa Temple of Busan, even though I tried to write while doing a temple stay for the first time in my life, even though I had done the 108 bows for the first time in my life, this, because I still couldn’t write despite having done all this······. I’ve committed a grave sin. I’m sorry.</p><div></div><p>I believe that you readers may be unfamiliar with how important of a position editors hold. However, for 〈Dungeon Defense〉, especially this volume 5, this was a volume for which the hard work of the editor was absolutely necessary. Every direction has their own respective intentions. If the editor edits something while not knowing what my intentions are, then the direction immediately loses its life force. Not only the direction, but the black and white illustrations and the positioning of the lines are the same as well.</p><p>If you readers enjoyed volume 5, then know that the editor’s touch was in that hard work. People often refer to their editors as cocreators. I can say without any pretense that I’m a happy author for being able to work together with an editor who I can refer to as a ‘cocreator’. I shall do my best to write my next manuscript better. I give my thanks to my editor and Youngsang Publishing Media, Inc.</p><p>Finally, to my readers.</p><p>I’m sorry. I had promised in volume 4 that I would present to everyone a manuscript as soon as possible. I was unable to keep my promise. After a long period of time, I was finally able to barely prepare this single book during this season where autumn is approaching Chuseok. Once again, I apologize.</p><p>Excluding volume 1, in 〈Dungeon Defense〉, I’ve been trying to put in a subject that’s meaningful to me in each volume. Additionally, I try to sculpt that subject into an interesting story. There has never been a time where I had contemplated about what I could possibly talk about and how I could make it into a story more than I did while working on this volume. I wonder if I had finished this manuscript excessively hurriedly because I was being chased by that thought and I blame myself for it.</p><div class=\"ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center\"></div><p>In 〈Dungeon Defense〉 I confidently act out scenes and write lines. My confidence comes solely from the cheers of you, my readers. Thanks to those of you who had sent me an email letter. Thanks to those of you who had written down their appreciation and sent it to me. Before being thankful for the contents of the letters, I’m thankful for the fact that you all are still writing letters to someone, and the fact that that someone could be me. I felt so sinful for not being able to finish my manuscript for half a year, so there were many letters which I could not respond to. I ran away because I was ashamed. Since I was now able to barely release this volume, I will be reading all of the letters I had pushed aside and be responding to them.</p><p>Not only the letters, but the very act of you all reading these very words is the same as you cheering me on. I wonder how this volume was to you all. There is something I challenge myself to do each volume, but if that challenge was projected well in your eyes, then there is nothing more that I could hope for. While imagining that this book, which I had sent out into the world, is placed in all sorts of rooms, I shall give my thanks to you, my readers, once more.</p><p>Thank you.</p>"
